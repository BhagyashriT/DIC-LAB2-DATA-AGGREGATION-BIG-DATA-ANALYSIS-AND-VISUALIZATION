 BURBANK , Calif. — The Walt Disney Company ha been talking about plan to start a Netflix-style streaming service for two year . On Thursday came the big reveal .
 D-Day , a some in Hollywood called it .
 In a lavish presentation on the Disney lot , Robert A. Iger , Disney ’ s chief executive , offered long-awaited detail about his counterattack on the tech giant that have moved into the entertainment business . The linchpin is Disney Plus , a new subscription video service dedicated to movie and show from Disney , Pixar , the “ Star Wars ” franchise , National Geographic and Marvel .
 Disney Plus will cost $ 7 a month and arrive on Nov. 12 . ( Netflix ’ s cheapest plan is $ 9 , and it standard plan is $ 13 . ) Disney said it intended to roll out the streaming service in Europe and Asia starting next year . It expects subscriber to total 60 million to 90 million by 2024 .
 “ We are all-in , ” Mr. Iger said .
 In it first year , Disney Plus will offer 10 original film and 25 original series , including three “ Avengers ” spinoffs . Disney announced that all 30 season of “ The Simpsons ” would be available on Day One , along with nearly all the “ Star Wars ” movie , the entire Pixar library and family-focused movie and show from it Fox library like “ The Sound of Music ” and “ Malcolm in the Middle . ”
 To market Disney Plus , the company vowed to use the full reach of it empire a it ha never done before , starting with a “ Star Wars ” fan convention in Chicago this weekend . Disney will also mobilize it cruise line , global theme park , retail store , hotel and television network , including ESPN and ABC .
 The presentation , inside Soundstage 2 , home to the original “ Mickey Mouse Club , ” began with a 14-minute sizzle reel highlighting Disney ’ s vast library , which now includes Fox movie like “ Titanic , ” “ Avatar ” and “ Alien. ” Mr. Iger called the library “ a treasure trove of long-lasting , valuable content ” that “ no other content or technology company can rival . ”
 Mr. Iger added , “ It wa important to remind you that we ’ re starting from a position of strength , confidence and unbridled optimism . ”
 The moment amounted to a turning point in the streaming war . For the first time , a traditional medium company demonstrated the firepower needed to compete with Silicon Valley in the fast-growing realm of online video .
 Disney ’ s plan could have failed to impress , along the line of what happened to Apple last month when it staged a similar event focused on it streaming ambition . Apple trotted out celebrity but offered few specific — nothing on pricing , no launch date , barely any footage .
 Disney ha a mixed track record with technology , struggling to find a winning strategy with video game and failing to capitalize on tech-related acquisition like Maker , a YouTube-based video supplier .
 Unlike Apple , Disney unveiled footage from original show and film that are headed to Disney Plus . One live-action series is called “ The Mandalorian. ” Set in the “ Star Wars ” universe and created by Jon Favreau , the show cost an estimated $ 100 million for 10 episode , on a par with earlier season of HBO ’ s extravagant “ Game of Thrones . ”
 Disney also demonstrated the Disney Plus app . The simple user interface , with movie and television tile arranged against a dark background , will look familiar to any Netflix , Amazon or Hulu user . There will be “ recommended for you ” row of suggested show and movie , a well a the option to “ continue watching ” program .
 There will be tile dedicated to the Disney brand , including Pixar , ‘ Star Wars ’ and National Geographic . Each time a user hovers over a brand tile , an animated image is set off — firework blasting behind the Magic Kingdom for the Disney tile or a comic book flip for Marvel .
 Users can make a personalized avatar using character from Disney ’ s intellectual property , including Buzz Lightyear and Moana .
 While the three-and-a-half-hour presentation ’ s target audience wa Wall Street — analyst were invited to attend — the presentation wa also aimed at potential Disney Plus subscriber . Disney also discussed it broader streaming business , which includes Hulu , ESPN Plus and Hotstar , which ha 300 million monthly active user in India .
 Disney will “ likely ” bundle it disparate service at a discounted price , according to Kevin Mayer , chairman of the company ’ s Direct-to-Consumer and International division . Mr. Mayer said that Disney wa “ actively evaluating ” international strategy for Hulu , which currently operates exclusively in the United States . ( Unlike Netflix . )
 Will Disney greatly expand Hulu ’ s budget ? Randy Freer , the chief executive of Hulu , said it planned to expand original program but did not say by how much .
 With Disney ’ s acquisition of much of 21st Century Fox , it now owns 60 percent of Hulu , giving the service a majority owner for the first time in it history . ( The other company with ownership stake include Comcast , at 30 percent , and AT & T ’ s Warner Media . ) Hulu now ha 25 million subscriber . Disney said it expected Hulu ’ s subscriber number to reach 40 million to 60 million in five year , and to be profitable by 2023 or 2024 .
 Most analyst have sky-high expectation for Disney Plus , which the company style a Disney+ .
 “ Our confidence in the resilient success of Disney+ come from the company ’ s unmatched brand recognition , extensive premium content and unparalleled ecosystem to market the service , ” Alexia Quadrani , an analyst at J.P. Morgan , wrote in a recent report . Bank of Montreal and Cowen and Company both upgraded Disney ’ s stock ahead of Thursday ’ s presentation .
 Mr. Iger ha spent year laying the groundwork for Disney Plus . In 2015 , a Netflix grew at a blistering rate , Disney began experimenting overseas with an app called DisneyLife . Rolled out in Britain , DisneyLife offered old movie and television series , child ’ s e-books , game and music . Without new movie , or at least exclusive content , interest wa limited .
 In 2016 Mr. Iger started talking more openly about needing to develop a streaming business — a risky proposition for a company with vast traditional television holding . Disney paid $ 1 billion for a 33 percent stake in BamTech , a streaming service company , eventually paying $ 1.58 billion more for majority control .
 Mr. Iger announced in summer 2017 that Disney would introduce it own Netflix-style service and stop selling movie rerun right to Netflix , forgoing hundred of million of dollar in revenue . In 2018 came Disney ’ s $ 71.3 billion purchase of 21st Century Fox asset , including National Geographic and the Fox movie studio . Mr. Iger positioned the acquisition a supercharging Disney ’ s move into streaming .
 Michael Nathanson , a medium analyst at MoffettNathanson , estimated in a report on Tuesday that Disney Plus could lose a much a $ 1.8 billion annually through 2023 , with programming a one major expense . Add in loss from Hulu and ESPN Plus and Mr. Nathanson expects Disney ’ s streaming division to lose roughly $ 3.8 billion this year and next .
 At least nine new movie are in production or advanced development for Disney Plus , with budget ranging from $ 20 million to $ 60 million . Disney is remaking two musical from it animation library a live-action film : “ Lady and the Tramp ” ( 1955 ) and “ The Sword in the Stone ” ( 1963 ) . Other new movie include “ Togo , ” a period adventure about a sled dog ; “ Noelle , ” starring Anna Kendrick a Santa ’ s daughter ; and an animated “ Phineas and Ferb ” movie .
 Marvel Studios is working on three Disney Plus show . One will focus on Loki from the “ Avengers ” movie , with Tom Hiddleston reprising the role . Another “ Avengers ” star , Elizabeth Olsen , will reprise her Scarlet Witch character in a second series . A third show will be associated with “ Captain America : The Winter Soldier , ” with Anthony Mackie returning a the Falcon .
 Also in the work are episodic spinoffs of Disney franchise like “ High School Musical ” and “ Monsters , Inc. ” Additionally , Disney is working on 10 unscripted show , including a Disney-themed cooking competition , “ Be Our Chef , ” and a series called “ Encore ! ” that reunites the cast of high school musical long after graduation and asks them to recreate their performance .
 Roughly 500 film from Disney ’ s library , including new movie like “ Captain Marvel , ” and 7,500 episode of old Disney-branded television show like “ Hannah Montana ” will anchor Disney Plus .

 LOS ANGELES — A law firm that ha battled company like Intel and Farmers Insurance over unequal pay for female employee is now taking on the Walt Disney Company .
 Andrus Anderson , which is based in San Francisco , filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Tuesday claiming that Disney discriminates against female worker by paying them le than their male counterpart . The complaint , filed on behalf of two employee at Walt Disney Studios , LaRonda Rasmussen and Karen Moore , asks for back pay , lost benefit and other compensation .
 The plaintiff also want a judge to force Disney to create internal program to “ remedy the effect of Disney ’ s past and present unlawful employment policy , ” including adjusting salary and benefit for other woman and creating a task force that compiles report on progress . Lori E. Andrus and Jennie Lee Anderson , lawyer representing the woman , asked that the case be certified a a class action .
 “ Women are fed up with being treated a cheap labor , ” Ms. Andrus said , noting that Tuesday wa National Equal Pay Day , the point in the year at which , on average , a woman ’ s pay for working in 2018 and 2019 would equal a man ’ s pay just for 2018 . “ We hope that this lawsuit will shed some light on the pay discrimination that Disney is subjecting it hard-working female employee to . ”
 In a statement , Disney said , “ The lawsuit is without merit and we will defend against it vigorously . ”
 On Wednesday , Disney added in a statement , “ The lawsuit ’ s uninformed generalized allegation about Disney ’ s policy and practice are baseless . Disney maintains robust pay equity practice and policy . Even before California ’ s Fair Pay Act , Disney created a specialized team of compensation professional and lawyer to analyze and address the company ’ s pay equity practice . ”
 Companies are facing increasing pressure to address question of gender inequality in the workplace . The Labor Department is investigating whether Google systematically underpays woman , an accusation that the tech giant denies . ( A recent study conducted by the company indicated that men were being underpaid , though critic said that the research ignored broader question of gender inequity . )
 Time ’ s Up , the Hollywood-led initiative to combat workplace harassment and inequality , said Monday that it had teamed with California lawmaker and Jennifer Siebel Newsom , the wife of Gov . Gavin Newsom , on a campaign to pressure California company to sign an “ equal pay pledge. ” So far , 13 company have agreed , including two in the entertainment business : Apple and AT & T , which owns WarnerMedia .
 Britain ha recently forced a reckoning about unequal pay by requiring company to publicly air their salary information . Ms. Andrus noted that the statistic that Disney released in Britain , where it employ about 1,600 people , showed a large disparity between men and woman . Disney said at the time that the data wa misleading , noting that the company compensates and promotes employee “ based on their role , experience and performance . ”
 Ms. Rasmussen ha worked at Disney for 11 year , most recently a a product development manager at Walt Disney Studios , according to the complaint filed on Tuesday . In 2017 , she complained to Disney ’ s human resource department about being paid le than men performing the same or very similar job and asked for an audit , the lawsuit said .
 The audit found that men were paid more , but Disney told Ms. Rasmussen that the amount of her pay wa “ not due to gender. ” In November 2018 , Disney raised her annual salary by $ 25,000 and said the increase resulted from “ an evaluation of market forces. ” Even with the increase , Ms. Rasmussen asserts that she is paid le than male counterpart .
 Ms. Moore ha worked for Disney for over two decade , the complaint said , and is a senior copyright administrator at the studio ’ s music label . Ms. Moore say that she wa discouraged from applying for a manager position and that , after the job description wa changed , a man wa hired . He is “ making significantly more than Ms. Moore even though they are both performing the same or substantially similar work , ” according to the complaint .

 `` Investors find a lot of promise in Disney 's offering because it 's well positioned to fight the like of Netflix for consumer ' money , '' said Clement Thibault , analyst at global financial market platform Investing.com .

 LOS ANGELES — “ Everything the light touch is our kingdom . ”
 It ’ s a line from Disney ’ s “ The Lion King , ” spoken by Mufasa to young Simba a they sit atop Pride Rock . And on Wednesday morning , just after midnight on the East Coast , it seemed to describe the Walt Disney Company itself , a the conglomerate closed it $ 71.3 billion acquisition of 21st Century Fox asset . It is now an entertainment colossus the size of which the world ha never seen .
 The ripple effect may not become clear for year . Analysts say that Disney could force smaller studio to merge a they scramble to compete . It will have greater leverage over theater owner when it come to box office split . And Disney ’ s plan to use Fox content to forcefully move into streaming could slow the growth of Netflix .
 “ This deal definitely reshapes the landscape , ” said Michael Nathanson , a leading medium analyst .
 Disney now owns most of Rupert Murdoch ’ s former empire , including the 20th Century Fox movie and television studio , which includes the “ X-Men , ” “ Avatar ” and “ Simpsons ” franchise ; Blue Sky , the “ Ice Age ” animation studio that is based in Connecticut ; the National Geographic and FX cable network ; most of the streaming service Hulu ; and Star , a fast-growing television-service provider in India .
 Disney had been a mere behemoth , dominating sport television through ESPN , controlling the global theme park business and running Hollywood ’ s No . 1 movie operation , with studio that include Marvel , Pixar and Lucasfilm . But the company decided that it needed to bulk up even more a the tech giant aggressively moved into Hollywood . The competition now includes Apple , which is scheduled to unveil it television and movie plan on Monday .
 “ This is an extraordinary and historic moment for u , ” Robert A. Iger , Disney ’ s chief executive , said in a statement on Tuesday .
 Mr. Iger ha staked his legacy on this deal , and he had to fend off an aggressive play by Comcast on two continent to gain control of Mr. Murdoch ’ s trove . ( Mr. Iger ultimately lost Sky , the British pay-television company . ) The acquisition is the largest in Disney ’ s 96-year history , dwarfing even the 1995 purchase of Capital Cities / ABC . That cost $ 19 billion ( about $ 32 billion in today ’ s money ) and , because it included ESPN , served a a growth engine for Disney for two decade .
 The Fox asset are meant to do the same for Disney in the year ahead . Disney is now trying to become le dependent on cable channel like ESPN , which are in slow , steady decline owing to cord-cutting . Instead , Disney ha decided to move into the rapidly growing realm of online video , a direct-to-consumer business defined by Netflix . Mr. Iger belief that the Fox asset will enhance that plan , which includes a streaming service called Disney+ later this year .
 “ The pace of disruption ha only hastened , ” Mr. Iger told The New York Times in an interview when the deal wa announced . “ This will allow u to greatly accelerate our direct-to-consumer strategy , which is our highest priority . ”
 The challenge are daunting . Mr. Iger and his lieutenant need to persuade investor to start viewing Disney more like a technology company , where near-term financial turbulence is often overlooked . Integrating the Fox asset will bring headache that include substantial layoff — analyst project more than 3,000 — and the melding of two starkly different corporate culture . When the deal wa announced in December 2017 , James L. Brooks , a creator of “ The Simpsons , ” posted an image on Twitter that showed an angry Homer Simpson strangling Mickey Mouse .
 To win approval from antitrust regulator around the world , Disney had to agree to modest concession .
 It is already deep in the process of selling Fox ’ s 22 regional sport channel , a move required by the Justice Department . The Yankees teamed with Amazon this month , for instance , to buy the YES Network , which serf the New York metropolitan area , for roughly $ 3.5 billion . To appease European regulator , Disney agreed to divest a stake in A+E Networks , which include the History channel . ( Disney will retain 50 percent ownership of the division in the United States ; Hearst owns the other half . )
 The final sticking point came from Brazil and Mexico . Regulators in those country are forcing Disney to sell Fox Sports , a competitor to ESPN that hold extensive right to televise soccer match . Brazil ’ s antitrust regulator , Cade , said in a statement that operating both channel would give Disney too much control of the sport TV market in the country . Mexico ’ s telecommunication regulator , IFT , held a similar view and added stipulation about Disney ’ s ownership of the National Geographic and Nat Geo Wild channel .
 At Disney ’ s annual meeting this month , Mr. Iger said the 20th Century Fox and Fox Searchlight label — trumpet fanfare included — would continue to exist . That decision pleased Hollywood , but it could lead to consumer confusion since Mr. Murdoch retained ownership of the Fox broadcast network , a chain of local Fox television station and his crown jewel , Fox News . Those business , along with the FS1 sport channel , were rolled into a new publicly traded company , Fox Corporation , on Tuesday .
 Paul D. Ryan , the former Republican congressman from Wisconsin who served a speaker of the House from October 2015 to January 2019 , joined the Fox board on Tuesday . Other board member include Mr. Murdoch and Roland A. Hernandez , a former chief executive of Telemundo . Mr. Murdoch ’ s oldest son , Lachlan , serf a the new company ’ s chief executive .
 The Murdochs are expected to receive roughly $ 12 billion in proceeds from the Disney deal , according to Bloomberg . Shareholders in the asset that were sold to Disney had the option to accept Disney share or cash out . Disney said on Friday that , based on initial result of that process , holder of about 52 percent of share asked for cash and 37 percent asked for Disney share . The balance did not make a request .

 New show already on tap include `` The Mandalorian , '' the first live action `` Star Wars '' series , created by Jon Favreau ; a prequel to the `` Star Wars '' film `` Rogue One , '' starring Diego Luna ; a series about the Marvel character Loki , starring Tom Hiddleston ; a rebooted `` High School Musical '' series ; and a new documentary series focused on Disney .
 Disney is approaching the streaming industry from a `` position of strength , confidence and unbridled optimism , '' CEO Bob Iger said Thursday . Iger ha led the company since 2005 and expects to step down when his contract end in 2021 .
 The service 's entire lineup will cover five category : Disney , Pixar , Marvel , Star Wars and National Geographic .
 Although Disney ha an enviable track record of producing show and film that attract huge audience , it attempt to build it own Netflix is risky . To make the leap , Disney ended a lucrative licensing relationship with Netflix , which had become the video streaming home for it latest film after their theatrical release , a well a many of it TV series and classic movie .
 But now movie that came out in 2019 , and going forward , will be streamed only on Disney Plus . That includes `` Captain Marvel , '' which came out earlier this year ; `` Avengers : Endgame , '' which debut in late April ; and the upcoming `` Toy Story 4 , '' live-action movie `` The Lion King '' and `` Aladdin ; '' and `` Star Wars Episode IX . ''
 In many way , it 's hard to compare Netflix with Disney because of the widely different type of show each offer , said eMarketer analyst Paul Verna .
 `` The interesting thing is both company have ended up in the same place , but they 've come to it from vastly different background , '' he said .
 Disney will also contend with a new streaming service from Apple , which is expected to be released in the fall . Apple ha not yet said how much it service will cost or when exactly it will launch .
 Last month , Disney completed it biggest deal yet with it $ 71 billion acquisition of Fox 's entertainment business . The first 30 season of `` The Simpsons '' will now stream exclusively on Disney Plus .
 The Fox takeover help Disney tighten it control over TV show and movie from start to finish — from creating the program to distributing them though television channel , movie theater , streaming service and other avenue . Disney will also get valuable data on customer and their entertainment-viewing habit , which it can then use to sell advertising .
 The Fox deal also gave Disney a controlling stake in Hulu . Iger ha said Hulu will continue to offer general entertainment programming while Disney Plus will be focused on family fare .
 Along with it strong brand , Disney ha the advantage of having a clear strategy for each of it streaming service , Verna said , including Disney Plus , Hulu and ESPN Plus . Disney executive hinted the company would `` likely '' bundle the three at a discounted price , but declined to give more detail .
 Terminating it deal with Netflix will cost Disney about $ 150 million in licensing revenue alone during it current fiscal year ending in September .
 Disney is betting it new service will quickly offset that . By dangling a mix of familiar franchise and beloved animated classic , along with original programming , it figure the new service will be irresistible to family , even if they already subscribe to other service . It expects Disney Plus to be profitable during it 2024 fiscal year .
 The plunge into video streaming is likely to confront Disney with new challenge . One of the biggest dilemma will center on how long Disney wait after a new film 's theatrical release to make it available on it new streaming service .
 Disney said movie would become available on it streaming service only after the traditional theatrical release period and home movie debut , which includes DVDs and purchasing streaming video . That put it schedule behind that of some competitor . Netflix film such a the award-winning `` Roma '' and `` The Ballad of Buster Scruggs '' have either become available for streaming on the same day or just a few day after their short run in theater .
 With nearly 140 million worldwide subscriber , Netflix already ha proven it mettle while warding off one competitive threat after another in the 12 year since it pivoted from DVD-by-mail rental to video streaming .
 Now , Netflix is locking horn with a company that ha been steadily expanding upon it Disney franchise during a shopping spree that ha seen it snap up other major studio .

 The cost of the service wa lower than the $ 7.50 per month that Wall Street analyst expected on average , according to a Reuters poll , and could likely be seen a a stronger bid to appeal to more customer .
 Patrice Cucinello , a director at Fitch Ratings , said Disney had priced the new service `` very affordably . ''
 `` Disney is approaching streaming offering , particularly Disney+ , with gun blazing , looking to take share and quickly ramp subscriber growth , '' Cucinello said .

 Disney kicked off it presentation to Wall Street analyst at it Burbank , California , headquarters on Thursday with a video that demonstrated the breadth of it portfolio , showing clip from dozen of classic TV show and movie from `` Frozen '' and `` The Lion King '' to `` Avatar '' and `` The Sound of Music . ''

 GLOBAL GROWTH
 Executives said they see opportunity to take it ESPN+ sport streaming video service to Latin America and are looking into international expansion of it Hulu streaming video business , which offer movie and show targeted to adult .
 Disney also forecast Hulu 's subscriber to reach 40 million to 60 million by fiscal 2024 and reach profitability in the United States by either 2023 or 2024 . Hulu currently ha 25 million subscriber and is expected to lose $ 1.5 billion in the current fiscal year .
 The digital push is Disney 's response to cord-cutting , the dropping of cable service that ha hit it ESPN sport network and other channel , and the rise of Netflix Inc . The Silicon Valley upstart ha amassed 139 million customer worldwide since it began streaming 12 year ago .
 Disney will join the market at a time when audience are facing a host of choice , and monthly bill , for digital entertainment . Apple , AT & T Inc 's WarnerMedia and others plan new streaming service .
 To bolster it potential digital portfolio , Disney recently purchased film and TV asset from Rupert Murdoch 's 21st Century Fox and gained prized property such a `` Avatar . ''
 Disney had been supplying new movie such a `` Black Panther '' and `` Beauty and the Beast '' to Netflix after their run in theater but ended that arrangement this year to feed it own streaming ambition . The company estimated it is foregoing $ 150 million in licensing revenue this fiscal year by saving programming for it own platform .
 The Disney+ programming will draw in part from Disney 's deep library of classic family film . It also will include exclusive original content such a a live-action `` Star Wars '' series called `` The Mandalorian , '' a show focused on Marvel movie villain Loki , and animated `` Monsters at Work , '' inspired by hit Pixar movie `` Monsters Inc . ''
 Some new Disney movie , such a a `` Lady and the Tramp '' remake , will go directly to the Disney+ app . Other new release will appear on Disney+ after their run in theater and after they cycle out of the home video sale window , executive have said .

 The new policy , which doe not apply to Disney park in France , China and Japan , wa greeted with widespread praise .
 Dennis Speigel , the president of the consulting company International Theme Park Service , said Disney chose “ the right course . ”

 The smoking ban will “ ratchet up the bar for the industry , ” he added . “ Other park operator will follow suit . ”
 A spokeswoman for Cedar Fair Parks , which owns and operates about a dozen amusement park across the country , said she wa “ not aware of any plan for an all-out smoking ban ” by her organization .

 Ron Miller , who rose through the rank of his father-in-law ’ s entertainment company , Walt Disney Productions , but whose time a chief executive wa tumultuous and ended with his ouster , died on Saturday at his home in Napa , Calif . He wa 85 .
 The Walt Disney Family Museum in San Francisco , where he had been board president , said Mr. Miller died of congestive heart failure .
 When Mr. Miller became president and chief operating officer of Walt Disney Productions ( now the Walt Disney Company ) in 1980 , his overriding mission wa to reinvigorate it film division , where he had spent most of his career a a producer and executive .
 Live-action movie like “ Herbie Goes Bananas ” and “ The Last Flight of Noah ’ s Ark ” were not generating great business , and the studio ’ s new animated film were not a memorable a it classic like “ Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs ” and “ Pinocchio . ”
 “ We ’ ve got trouble , ” Mr. Miller told The Los Angeles Times a few month after his appointment . “ And we ’ re doing something about it . ”
 Over four year — a president and , for 18 month , chief executive — he oversaw the creation of Disney Channel , the company ’ s cable network . He established Touchstone Pictures a a vehicle to release film that were targeted at adult , scoring a quick hit with “ Splash ” ( 1984 ) , a romantic comedy starring Tom Hanks and Daryl Hannah .
 He also acquired a real estate company that helped Disney develop land near it Disney World complex in Lake Buena Vista , Fla. , and brought the company closer to an agreement to open a Disney theme park in France . ( It would open outside Paris in 1992 . )
 But it wa not enough . By May 1984 , Mr. Miller wa at the center of a corporate crisis .
 First , Disney agreed to fend off a hostile takeover attempt by the corporate raider Saul Steinberg with an extremely expensive buyback of Mr. Steinberg ’ s stake in the company . That led more than 20 disgruntled shareholder to sue the company for wasting corporate asset . Mr. Miller defended the board ’ s payment to Mr. Steinberg a a way to send him away and keep the company intact .
 Then , during the summer , an activist shareholder , Irwin Jacobs , who appeared poised to launch a takeover of his own , helped force Disney to drop it proposed acquisition of Gibson Greetings , the third-ranked company in the greeting card business .
 Even a the restive board wa evaluating Mr. Miller ’ s performance in late August , he wa trumpeting the synergy he envisioned for it costliest animated film ever , “ The Black Cauldron , ” marketing it a a theatrical release , a videocassette , a featured Disney Channel movie and a theme-park ride . When the film wa released the next year , it flopped .
 Mr. Miller did not have much more time to contemplate Disney ’ s future . In early September , the company ’ s board asked him to resign .
 Before the board member voted , he looked at them and angrily asked : “ Don ’ t you have something to say to me ? Aren ’ t you men ? ”
 According to an account in “ DisneyWar ” ( 2005 ) , by James B. Stewart , now a New York Times business columnist , Mr. Miller added : “ I ’ ve given my life to this company . I ’ ve never worked anywhere else . I think I ’ ve taken great stride in leading it a far a it ha come . I feel like this is a betrayal . ”
 He wa replaced a chief executive by Michael D. Eisner , whom Mr. Miller had earlier tried to recruit to Disney .
 “ For my entire career , I have had great respect and fondness for Ron , ” Mr. Eisner wrote on Twitter on Sunday . Mr. Eisner stepped down in 2005 .
 Ronald William Miller wa born on April 17 , 1933 , in Los Angeles . His mother , Stella ( Bennett ) Miller , worked for a candy maker ; his father , John , wa a tire builder at Goodyear Tire and Rubber .
 Ron played baseball and football in high school and received a scholarship to play football at the University of Southern California , where he wa a receiver for three year . He did not graduate .
 While at U.S.C . he met Diane Disney , Walt ’ s older daughter , on a blind date . They married in 1954 , around the time construction wa starting on Disneyland , in Anaheim , Calif. ; Mr. Miller ’ s first job for Mr. Disney wa chauffeuring architectural plan between Disney office in Burbank and the construction site . After serving in the Army , he played for the Los Angeles Rams in the 1956 football season , catching 11 pass for 129 yard .
 Mr. Disney watched Mr. Miller play two game that season but wa concerned that his son-in-law might be grievously hurt — he saw him knocked unconscious on one play — and asked him to come work for him .
 “ You know , I don ’ t want to be the father to your child , ” Mr. Disney said , a Mr. Miller recalled in an interview with The Los Angeles Times in 1984 . “ You ’ re going to die out there . ”
 Mr. Miller ’ s first job wa with the crew of the film “ Old Yeller ” ( 1957 ) . He went on to spend more than 20 year a a producer or executive producer of Disney movie like “ That Darn Cat ! ” ( 1965 ) , “ Escape to Witch Mountain ” ( 1975 ) , “ The Shaggy D.A. ” ( 1976 ) and “ Freaky Friday ” ( 1977 ) .
 Following his ouster , he and his wife moved to Northern California , where he ran Silverado Vineyards and where she conceived and opened the Disney Family Museum . She died in 2013 .
 Mr. Miller ’ s survivor include his daughter , Joanna Miller , Tamara Diane Miller and Jennifer Goff ; his son , Christopher , Walter , Ronald and Patrick Miller ; 13 grandchild ; and four great-grandchildren .
 In an interview last year with the San Francisco magazine The Nob Hill Gazette , Mr. Miller described what it wa like working for Mr. Disney , who died in 1966 .
 “ I had always been shy , ” he said , “ and when I first started becoming involved in creative meeting , I laid back . I had good thought , but I let somebody else eventually come up with the idea .
 “ But Walt wasn ’ t afraid to throw out any idea , ” he continued . “ He threw out everything . I realized you can ’ t prove to others you ’ ve got a certain talent unless you let them know you ’ ve got a talent . ”

 ( Reuters ) - Walt Disney Co Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger took a dig at the popularity of social medium , saying it wa a powerful marketing tool and Hitler would have loved it , Variety reported .
 `` It 's the most powerful marketing tool an extremist could ever hope for because by design social medium reflects a narrow world view filtering out anything that challenge our belief while constantly validating our conviction and amplifying our deepest fear , '' Iger said , while being honored with a humanitarian award .
 `` Hitler would have loved social medium . ''
 Iger also blamed social medium for spreading hate , saying that it creates a false sense that everyone share the same opinion , according to the entertainment business news portal .
 `` Hate and anger are dragging u toward the abyss once again , '' Iger said , adding that it is consuming public discourse and shaping the country and culture into something that is wholly unrecognizable to those who still believe in civility , human right and basic decency .
 While imploring the audience to renounce and reject hate in all form , Iger also called on voter to `` demand more '' from elected official .
 Disney did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment .
 Disney is hosting it investor day later on Thursday , where the company is expected to unveil new detail about it streaming service , Disney+ .

 When the Guggenheim , designed by Frank Lloyd Wright , opened in 1959 , it wa both praised ( “ Mr . Wright ’ s greatest building . New York ’ s greatest building ” ) and scorned ( an “ inverted oatmeal dish ” ) .
 The museum took it cue from a design Wright had experimented with before , initially for a project that wa never built .
 In 1924 , at the dawn of America ’ s love affair with automobile , a businessman named Gordon Strong worked with Wright on an attraction at the top of Sugarloaf Mountain in Maryland that would “ serve a an objective for short motor trip ” from nearby Washington and Baltimore .
 Wright designed a circular building with drivable ramp that wound around the outside like a ribbon . Strong hated it , likening the design to the Tower of Babel , and the project wa abandoned .
 But Wright believed in his vision enough to return to it , in an inverted form , when the Guggenheim asked him to design a “ temple of the spirit , a monument . ”
 Yearning for freedom ? A calf ha become the latest farm animal to be found wandering the street of New York City in recent day .

 LOS ANGELES — Disney is taking back James Gunn , the creative force behind it “ Guardians of the Galaxy ” movie franchise , reversing it contentious decision in July to fire the filmmaker for offensive joke he wrote on Twitter several year ago .
 The tweet by Mr. Gunn , who wrote and directed the Marvel superhero film “ Guardians of the Galaxy ” in 2014 and delivered a smash sequel in 2017 , contained joke about pedophilia , AIDS , rape and the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attack . Two far-right provocateur , Mike Cernovich and Jack Posobiec , threw a spotlight on the comment — written between 2009 and 2012 — after Mr. Gunn harshly criticized President Trump online .
 Disney executive seemed to acknowledge on Friday that they made a misstep of their own in almost immediately firing Mr. Gunn in the aftermath : At the time , “ Guardians ” cast member condemned the decision a an overreaction to the “ mob mentality ” of the internet . If nothing else , the reversal reflects the challenge that Hollywood studio face a they contend with online furor over past behavior in response to the # MeToo and Time ’ s Up movement , all while trying to protect billion-dollar film property .
 Walt Disney Studios revealed Mr. Gunn ’ s reinstatement a the director of “ Guardians of the Galaxy 3 ” in an article on Deadline.com , a trade news site . Disney declined to comment further , except to confirm the report ’ s accuracy . In a statement on Twitter , Mr. Gunn called himself “ incredibly humbled ” and “ tremendously grateful ” to those who had supported him in recent month .
 “ I am always learning and will continue to work at being the best human being I can be , ” he wrote . “ I deeply appreciate Disney ’ s decision . ”
 Alan F. Horn , chairman of Walt Disney Studios , decided to rehire Mr. Gunn — several month ago — after a series of meeting with the director . Mr. Horn , who reached out to Mr. Gunn , had been impressed with his public apology on the day Disney fired him . Mr. Gunn repeatedly took responsibility for his word , which he called “ stupid , not at all funny , wildly insensitive and certainly not provocative like I had hoped . ”
 “ Regardless of how much time ha passed , ” he had added , “ I understand and accept the business decision taken today . ”
 Mr. Gunn ’ s response stood in contrast to how other star have reacted in similar situation . Kevin Hart , for instance , wa initially defensive when his past anti-gay comment on Twitter resurfaced in December after he wa named host of the Academy Awards telecast . Mr. Hart did not apologize at first , instead posting a video online in which he said : “ Guys , I ’ m almost 40 year old . If you don ’ t believe that people change , grow , evolve a they get older , I don ’ t know what to tell you . ”
 Six hour later , he stepped down a Oscar host and offered a perfunctory apology .
 It wa unclear to what degree Disney wa influenced by blowback from “ Guardians ” fan over Mr. Gunn ’ s ouster . Hundreds of thousand of people signed a Change.org petition asking Disney to reconsider .
 “ Guardians of the Galaxy ” is a crucial property for Disney . The first two movie , starring Chris Pratt a Star-Lord and Zoe Saldana a Gamora , and featuring fan-favorite creature like Groot and Rocket raccoon , collected roughly $ 1.6 billion at the global box office . Disney also sell “ Guardians ” merchandise and is counting on an expensive new “ Guardians ” attraction at Epcot in Florida to sell theme park vacation .
 Fans greeted Mr. Gunn ’ s official return to the Marvel universe with euphoria . Mr. Cernovich , for one , wa not happy . The far-right blogger , author and YouTube personality wrote on Twitter , “ If you think Gunn getting rehired hurt me rather than child , you ’ re a sick person and part of the problem . ”

 The crash occurred on Interstate 75 near Gainesville , Fla. , at about 3:40 p.m. , when a tractor-trailer and a car collided in a northbound lane , according to the authority . The vehicle careered through a guardrail into southbound traffic , striking a van carrying the child and another tractor-trailer .
 “ Once the semi struck , they both caught on fire , a well a the passenger car , ” Lt. Patrick Riordan , of the Florida Highway Patrol , said on Friday morning at a news conference .
 It is unclear what caused the vehicle to collide . The crash is under investigation .
 About 50 gallon of diesel fuel spilled onto the highway , intensifying the flame and releasing plume of black smoke . A fifth vehicle struck either some of the injured or some debris , he said .
 The van had been carrying nine child and three woman from the Avoyelles House of Mercy church in Marksville , La. , according to a statement by Kevin Cox , superintendent of the Louisiana district of the United Pentecostal Church International .
 Cierra Bordelan , 9 ; Brieana Descant , 10 ; Cara Descant , 13 ; Joel Cloud , 14 ; and Jeremiah Warren , 14 , were killed .

 When Edmund Gowery , “ ’ 70 playwright , ” show up a the answer to 57 Across in a crossword puzzle in The New York Times , a giant Borgesian wormhole gape open . Out of it emerges the plot of “ Nantucket Sleigh Ride , ” the newish John Guare play that opened at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater on Monday .
 That plot can hardly be summarized , let alone spoiled ; it ’ s a shaggy whale story designed to defy all logic but a dream ’ s . Also like a dream , it almost instantly dissolve in the light .
 But out of respect for Mr. Guare ’ s nearly five decade of marvelous invention — “ The House of Blue Leaves , ” “ Six Degrees of Separation , ” “ Landscape of the Body ” and the “ Atlantic City ” screenplay among the result — let ’ s put this dream on the couch and see what it ’ s trying to tell u .
 The 2010 crossword throw Gowery ( John Larroquette ) back to the summer of 1975 . Flush with money from “ Internal Structure of Stars , ” his sole hit , he ha recently bought , sight unseen , a house on Nantucket a an investment property . The discovery of a pedophile pornography ring operating there force him to the island and into a mystery that will eventually involve not only Borges but also Magritte , “ Jaws , ” a Roman Polanski remake of Hitchcock ’ s “ Suspicion , ” a possible murder , two weird child , frozen Walt Disney and an electrocuted lobster .
 For it turn out that Gowery ha deeply offended some of the local , whose amateur production of “ Internal Structure of Stars ” he rudely refused to attend the previous winter . The disappointed actor and director , seeking revenge , eventually strip him of his wallet , his white suit , his anxiety med and his career . Nevertheless , this being a comedy , he emerges from the adventure ahead , with one dollar ’ s profit , a woman who will become his life companion and a tale he will one day fashion like a Möbius strip into “ the greatest play since Aeschylus ” — which is to say , the one we ’ re seeing .
 A work that announces itself a the result of it own plot is a riddle at risk of an anticlimax , but in this pronouncement , at any rate , the author is joking . Still , the story ’ s detail and absurdity clearly have personal resonance for Mr. Guare , whose name could easily be mispronounced a Gowery . He , too , wa once the answer to a Times crossword clue ; he , too , met his wife on Nantucket in August 1975 . A trilogy of his earlier play wa set there .
 As this suggests , “ Nantucket Sleigh Ride ” is interested in how we make story of ourselves , but also in how we forget or revise them . Its particular focus is the havoc played by childhood memory . “ Internal Structure of Stars ” is Gowery ’ s maudlin autobiographical tale of abandonment at 11 by his tubercular parent . The Nantucket adventure reconstitutes the theme by bringing him in contact with the daughter ( Clea Alsip ) and grandchild ( Adam Chanler-Berat and Grace Rex ) of a beloved author whose child ’ s book also involve abandonment .
 This is where Disney , “ the legal guardian of every child in the universe , ” fit in , if anything can be said to fit into a play that begin with a puzzle and willfully remains one .
 What Mr. Guare seems to be after is a dramaturgy that is absurdist not for it own sake but a a kind of last-ditch naturalism , replicating the absurdity of actual life with all it serendipity , hyperlink , pothole and misprisions . He is one of our few major dramatist who dare to make play from the kind of anecdote about which we say at cocktail party : “ If this were a play , you ’ d never believe it . ”
 But if Mr. Guare ’ s earlier excursion in the anecdotal style made you feel like guest at just such a party , “ Nantucket Sleigh Ride ” ( like “ A Free Man of Color ” in 2010 ) make you feel like you ’ re stranded at one , in a corner with a drunk . Despite some heavy pruning and reshaping since it wa first produced ( under the title “ Are You There , McPhee ? ” ) at the McCarter Theater in 2012 , it remains , in Jerry Zaks ’ s zippy , overbright staging for Lincoln Center Theater , both hermitic and hermetic : obscure and airless .
 [ What ’ s new onstage and off : Sign up for our Theater Update newsletter ]
 That ’ s not a great environment for audience — or actor — to thrive in . Mr. Larroquette ha the right combination of swagger and self-doubt but spends most of the play nursing the harried affect of someone running for a bus that keep shutting it door every time he catch up . The rest of the cast , which includes several experienced farceurs and shape-shifters , is forced into more or le impossible contortion of whimsy , a job for which only Douglas Sills ( a a shrink , the child ’ s father and Disney ) seems factory-equipped .
 Still , you may get a shiver of the dark anxiety hiding in the writing a a ghost hide in a child ’ s crowded closet : Without other people to confirm your identity , you have none . Nor is that an anxiety that , for a playwright , get better with age . Mr. Guare is 81 , and while “ Nantucket Sleigh Ride ” is hardly valedictory , it doe betray doubt about ongoing fecundity .
 “ Lightning struck me once , ” Gowery say with an equanimity the play proceeds to topple . “ That ’ s once more than it strike most people. ” Another character helpfully point out that Verdi ’ s “ Otello ” and “ Falstaff ” were written when the composer wa nearing 90 — which , perhaps deliberately , is at least a decade off .
 Though I find his play fresher when he writes for female protagonist instead of male one — the woman here are basically tchotchke — Mr. Guare need not have worried about the friskiness of his imagination or the seaworthiness of his craft . They ’ re fine .
 “ Nantucket Sleigh Ride , ” it seems to me , is simply a story that didn ’ t want to be caught . Even the title seems to know it : It ’ s a local term for what happens when a whaler harpoon a whale . After hour or day of wild exertion , one or the other wind up dead .
 Or sometimes the audience doe .

 Roe Hartrampf , a Prince Charles , and Jeanna de Waal , a Diana Spencer , rehearse a scene re-enacting the engagement portrait shoot in “ Diana , ” a new musical . Charlie Sutton play the photographer .
 By Sarah Lyall
 SAN DIEGO — It is the early 1980s . People have poufy hair and wear pleated pant and shapeless voluminous skirt . The someday-king ( he hope ) of England , Prince Charles , is a man in possession of a fortune and in want of a wife . He is consulting his mother , wise Queen Elizabeth , for advice on what to do about Lady Diana Spencer , the 19-year-old assistant kindergarten teacher he ha been dating , if having a handful of chaste encounter constitutes dating .
 Because this is a musical , the queen break into song . What is love , she wonder , considering the complicated example of her longtime marriage to the handsome but chilly Prince Philip , who ha a wandering eye . Men may “ take other friend , ” but “ it doesn ’ t mean devotion end , ” she warble , before getting to the point : “ Whatever love mean . ”
 Charles , who unfortunately ha a longtime girlfriend , Camilla Parker Bowles , who even more unfortunately ha a husband , take up the refrain , musing on his predicament : He is about to propose to someone he barely know . He is perhaps the least qualified person in the kingdom to understand matter of the heart .
 Longtime observer of the force of nature that wa Diana , the Princess of Wales — and there are many of u out here , despite the fact that she died more than 20 year ago — will notice that “ whatever love mean ” is plucked from something Charles said after he and Diana announced their engagement , all the way back in 1981 .
 When the pair were asked whether they loved each another , Charles looked weirded out , a though the thought had never occurred to him .
 So that while Diana wa murmuring , “ Of course , ” Charles wa declaring , “ Whatever in love mean . ”
 It is this colossal mismatch of emotion and expectation that the maker of the new musical “ Diana ” have seized upon a the basis for this latest foray into the crowded field of Diana-divination . The production , still in rehearsal , is to begin preview on Feb. 19 at La Jolla Playhouse before opening on March 3 ; the planned run ha already been extended through April 7 .
 There are many way the Tony Award-winning creator of the show could have gone . In her relatively short and wholly vivid life , Diana wa many thing — naïve victim ; media-savvy manipulator ; loving mother ; fashion icon ; lost soul ; compassionate charity campaigner ; femme fatale — take your pick . How you saw her depended on where you stood .
 But at heart , said Christopher Ashley , the director of “ Diana , ” she wa a woman who dreamed of love — specifically the sort found in a romance novel or a fairy tale . And after landing a real-life prince , she discovered that prince — or at least Prince Charles — are not all they are cracked up to be .
 Musical theater doe love a princess — see “ Anastasia ” and “ Frozen , ” both on Broadway right now — but these are modern time , and marrying someone with a palace and a fancy title doe not guarantee a happy ending .
 “ We were interested in Diana a a character who start with one dream and actually get it , and then ha to find a new dream , ” said Mr. Ashley , who is also the Playhouse ’ s artistic director .
 The musical zip through her early life , settle into the royal romance and marriage , and — except for a quick epilogue tying up loose end — concludes when that marriage break down and a liberated Diana break free to find her own voice and her own way forward .
 “ What I love is how she constantly change her aspiration to advance herself , ” said Joe DiPietro , who wrote the book . He is 57 , around the same age a Diana would be , and supplemented his general understanding of her a a doomed mega-celebrity with extensive research from the exhaustive supply of book , article and film available in the infinite Diana-sphere . .
 “ I ’ m not a fan of musical that try to tell about someone ’ s whole life , ” he added . “ What wa interesting wa the marriage . I wanted it to be very focused . ”
 Diana once said that there were “ three people in my marriage , ” meaning her , Charles and Camilla . The musical make the trio a quartet by including Queen Elizabeth , who worked so hard , by all account , to keep the couple together , for the sake of kingdom and family . Other character in the ensemble include Diana ’ s sometime lover James Hewitt , but the focus is on those four .
 The royal-industrial complex is the gift that keep on giving . Who among the journalist and biographer and filmmaker and television producer in Britain ha not produced a work about the royal ? But while most of the recent royal effort have come courtesy of Brits like Peter Morgan ( “ The Queen , ” “ The Crown ” ) and Mike Bartlett ( “ King Charles III ” on Broadway ) this production is an all-American enterprise , reuniting the creative team behind “ Memphis , ” the left-field hit about the southern root of rock ‘ n ’ roll that won the 2010 Tony for best musical .
 “ We ’ re two guy from Jersey writing about the royal , ” said David Bryan , who wrote the music and collaborated with Mr. DiPietro on the lyric . ( You might know him from his day job , a the keyboardist for Bon Jovi . ) “ It would be like two Brits writing about the Kennedys , ” he added . “ In England , opinion is very divided , and so it help that we ’ re removed from the controversy , ” so we can see the story from an ocean-wide remove .
 Their distance , too , ha contributed to the production ’ s decision to not assign blame . It present it character a victim of circumstance , like protagonist of a Greek tragedy whose fate have been woven into the fabric of their life .
 Judy Kaye , a Tony winner for “ Phantom of the Opera ” and “ Nice Work if You Can Get It , ” play Elizabeth . “ When I wa younger , in my mind I wa taking side , ” she said of the end of the royal marriage .
 “ What we were being fed wa that there wa this young woman who wa a total victim , ” she said . “ But nobody is a total victim. ” She added : “ I feel sorry for all of them . ”
 Charles ’ s tragedy , she said , is that tradition and expectation forced him to give up the love of his life , Camilla . ( Of course , he ended up marrying her after Diana divorced him and then died in a fiery car accident during an ill-conceived excursion in Paris with her unsuitable lover , but that ’ s another story . )
 During a recent day of rehearsal at the Playhouse , line and lyric and dance number and even whole song were still being tweaked and reconsidered , a is often the case in the week before preview begin . A reporter and photographer were allowed to see only a few snippet .
 One song , “ This Is How Your People Dance , ” laid bare the chasm of taste and temperament between Charles and Diana .
 In the scene , Charles ( Roe Hartrampf , with a Charles-ian side part in his hair ) take Diana ( played by the English actress Jeanna de Waal ) to hear some music a a treat ( supposedly ) . Not music she like ; music he like — namely , Bach , performed by the Russian cellist Mstislav Rostropovich .
 He is transported . Diana doe her best to keep up , first guessing that she ’ s hearing Mozart and then saying , in an effort to be charming , that she wa “ close . ”
 “ Not really , ” Charles say .
 Her mind wanders . “ The Russian play on/Like an endless telethon/How I wish he were Elton John , ” she sings , a she rise from her seat and ( in her imagination , played out onstage ) embarks on a wild rave with the usher and other worker at the concert hall , dancing a a regular person rather than a royal .
 It might seem weird to have a longtime American rock musician writing song for a musical about the British royal family . But the character ’ musical taste are vivid reflection of their character . “ We thought , What if we gave each character a musical voice ? ” Mr. Bryan said .
 “ Diana should be pop and rock . Her song are emotional , and the chorus can get back , and there are more drum and keyboard . Kind of like my band . ”
 By way of illustration , he sang a few bar of Bon Jovi ’ s “ Livin ’ on a Prayer . ”
 Meanwhile , he continued , “ Charles should be contemporary , but like a string quartet . The paparazzo are like punk guitar and the Clash . The queen should be classical with royal drum and regalness . And Camilla should be Lite FM , adult contemporary . ”
 In any production about real-life people , the challenge for the performer is to present an alternative that can drown out the reality in the audience ’ s head . Ms. de Waal , for instance , bear a resemblance to but is no dead ringer for Diana .
 She ha studied video , taking on the plumminess of Diana ’ s accent , the coquettishness of her walk , the tilt of her head , but it can only go so far .
 “ We ’ ve been very clear that we ’ re not making a documentary , and I ’ m not her , ” she said . On the other hand , that “ leaf a lot of freedom to explore who she wa behind closed door , ” she added . “ We ’ re conscious to show that there wa a sort of mutual affection . She wasn ’ t delusional ; she wasn ’ t mad ; they did build a life together . ”
 Expect a major contribution from the costume designer , William Ivey Long , by all account an enthusiastic Diana obsessive who , by way of getting the job , tacked up hundred of picture of the princess in every outfit imaginable — her puffy-sleeved meringue of a wedding dress ; the sexy sheath worn a a see-what-you ’ re-missing statement of post-separation independence — on the wall of his studio in Manhattan .
 With early performance sold out and ticket sale brisk , expectation are high for “ Diana , ” which ( a yet ) ha no current plan to transfer to New York . The Playhouse ha become something of a crucible for Broadway , though not every show that originated here ha transferred successfully .

 LOS ANGELES — Robert Mapplethorpe ’ s photograph are pristine and painful , witty and wicked , forbidding and seductive . The mild-mannered Bryce Dessner is not the first composer I would have thought of to set them to music .
 Mr. Dessner — whose hourlong meditation on Mapplethorpe , “ Triptych ( Eyes of One on Another ) , ” had it premiere at Walt Disney Concert Hall here on Tuesday before touring worldwide — achieved fame a a member of the rock band the National , and ha sought a parallel career in the concert hall .
 Mellow and unobtrusive , with a heavy debt to Minimalism and it rock-infused progeny , his music is at it best when he ’ s his own softly suggestive electric guitar soloist . And on a small scale — a bright , vivid set of “ Murder Ballades ” ( 2013 ) ; the gentle percussion solo “ Tromp Miniature ” ( 2014 ) — his work can be charming . Longer piece , though conscientiously constructed , tend to go prettily nowhere . ( The New York Philharmonic will play “ Wires ” in November . )
 Mr. Dessner wa a teenager in Cincinnati in 1990 when a Mapplethorpe exhibition that traveled there , “ The Perfect Moment , ” became caught up in a classic culture-war conflagration over censorship and government support for the art . The city ’ s Contemporary Arts Center and it director faced obscenity charge ; they were acquitted in a trial viewed a a victory for free speech .
 “ The Perfect Moment ” drew from three Mapplethorpe portfolio : “ X ” ( image of gay S & M activity ) , “ Y ” ( flower study ) and “ Z ” ( nude portrait of black men ) . This tripartite structure in turn suggested a form for “ Triptych , ” which very loosely move from a mythologizing overture ( “ it wa said he had face of a god / yet some saw a demon with rope shoe ” ) to reflection on the obscenity trial and issue of race in his work .
 The elliptical libretto , by Korde Arrington Tuttle , draw on text by the poet Essex Hemphill , who argued that Mapplethorpe continued a long tradition of objectifying black body , and by Patti Smith , whose book “ Just Kids ” is a memoir of her friendship with the artist . The language is stylized and extravagantly poetic , matching the photograph ’ explicit sexual content while meeting their cool elegance with punk Romanticism ( “ worship the almighty / target practice / tell me to flex / tighten my torso ” ) .
 These text , while occasionally overwrought , do evoke the brew of objectification , glorification , aggression , submission , risk and reward in Mapplethorpe ’ s photograph , particularly those of black men . The word are not always easy on the artist ; they draw an uncomfortable parallel between different meaning of “ shooting ” someone , and , in one section constructed a a dialogue , suggest Mapplethorpe exploited his model .
 It ’ s heady , ambitious stuff . But Mr. Dessner , perhaps treading cautiously a a white composer in a potential racial minefield , keep the music — performed by 10 vocalist and 10 instrumentalist — resolutely lukewarm .
 He mine the vocal ensemble Roomful of Teeth for close harmony , undergirding their singing with a wan wash of string , the barest touch of propulsion . ( The Los Angeles Philharmonic ’ s New Music Group wa conducted by Sara Jobin . ) The tenor Isaiah Robinson , a featured soloist , made soulful wail ; his voice wa richer , the emotion in it both plainer and more complex , than that of mezzo-soprano Alicia Hall Moran , his female counterpart .
 There wa little sense of this blandly brooding , affectlessly luminous score shifting a the libretto did , leaving the word — only a handful of which were audible , with murky amplification partly to blame — adrift . The music can ’ t match the word ’ nuanced portrayal of Mapplethorpe ’ s vision and personality , reducing the work ’ s impact to dreary sanctification . ( I could have done without the facile queer utopianism of the finale : “ Every time we kiss / we confirm the new world coming . ” )
 A slideshow of Mapplethorpe ’ s image wa projected on a screen above the ensemble during the performance , and a young black actor moved slowly around the stage . These are perhaps suggestion of the fuller production of “ Triptych ” ( directed by Kaneza Schaal , who replaced the originally announced Daniel Fish ) that will have it premiere on March 15 in Ann Arbor , Mich. , and travel to the Brooklyn Academy of Music in June . A fleshed-out production may well enliven the piece . But if the music isn ’ t propelling the drama , visuals will ultimately always be window dressing .
 I know critic aren ’ t supposed to review performance that existed only in our imagination . But on the drive home from Disney Hall , my mind kept wandering to what the composer Georg Friedrich Haas might have done with this material . Known for plunging his player and audience alike into long , disconcerting stretch of total darkness , Mr. Haas is gifted at sonic evocation of control , oppression and extremity ; his work share the classicism of Mapplethorpe ’ s work , and it brutality .
 These indelible photograph deserve better music than Mr. Dessner ’ s thin , earnest worship .

 ( Reuters ) - Netflix Inc gave a weak forecast on Tuesday that unnerved investor just a Walt Disney Co and others prepare to escalate Hollywood 's streaming video war , although the company 's quarterly result beat Wall Street target .
 Shares of Netflix traded down about 1 percent at $ 355.02 in after-the-bell trading .
 Netflix predicted it would pick up 5 million new streaming subscriber from April through June . That wa below the 5.48 million consensus of industry analyst surveyed by FactSet .
 `` What 's making investor nervous is that there are sign of a slowdown in the second-quarter subscriber growth , '' said Haris Anwar , senior analyst at Investing.com . `` This is made all the more prominent by the looming threat of competition from Disney and Apple . ''
 Netflix added a record number of paid streaming customer in the first quarter , reaching a total of 148.86 million .
 The just-ended first quarter included the debut of original drama `` Sex Education '' and `` Russian Doll , '' and the company raised price in the United States , Mexico and Brazil .
 In a letter to shareholder , Netflix said it saw `` some modest short-term churn effect , '' or dropping of it service , in response to the price increase .
 From January through March , Netflix reported it added 7.86 million paid subscriber internationally , compared with the average analyst estimate of 7.14 million , according to IBES data from Refinitiv .
 The company said it signed up 1.74 million paid subscriber in the United States in the quarter , above the average analyst estimate of about 1.57 million , according to IBES data from Refinitiv .
 Netflix is spending billion to attract new customer while Disney and Apple Inc build streaming rival and Amazon.com Inc make gain with audience .
 `` With a combined market cap of around $ 2.2 trillion , those three bruiser are n't to be messed with , '' Hargreaves Lansdown equity analyst George Salmon said .
 Disney is viewed a one of Netflix 's strongest rival thanks to a broad portfolio of franchise popular with child - from Mickey Mouse to Marvel and Star Wars - and a brand trusted by parent . Last week , Disney priced it service at $ 7 per month , just over half the $ 13 price for Netflix 's most U.S. popular plan . The Disney+ service will launch in November .
 `` We do n't anticipate that these new entrant will materially affect our growth , '' Netflix said , `` because the transition from linear to on-demand entertainment is so massive and because of the different nature of our content offering . `` Disney is leading a shift among traditional medium company that had been selling programming to Netflix for year . Now , many have decided to keep their content for their own service . AT & T Inc 's WarnerMedia and Comcast Corp plan to move into the streaming market .
 Netflix spent $ 7.5 billion on TV show and movie for 2018 , and executive have said that amount will grow in 2019 . The aggressive spending ha led to a tripling of the company 's debt in two year , to $ 10.36 billion in 2018 , from $ 3.36 billion in 2016 .
 For the first quarter , Netflix said it net income rose to $ 344.1 million , or 76 cent per share , from $ 290.1 million , or 64 cent per share , a year earlier . Analysts on average were expecting 57 cent per share .
 Total revenue rose to $ 4.52 billion from $ 3.70 billion . Analysts on average had expected revenue of $ 4.50 billion .
 Netflix share had closed up 3 percent in regular Nasdaq trading on Tuesday ahead of the result .

 With 148 million subscriber and a value of $ 157 billion , Netflix is the leader in streaming . But Hulu , now controlled by Disney , ha something Netflix doesn ’ t : ad . And they are worth a lot .
 By Edmund Lee
 Everyone ’ s gunning for Netflix .
 Amazon , AT & T , Apple and the Walt Disney Company have spent billion to create or bolster their own streaming network to take on the giant in the field . Some , like Apple and Amazon , are meant to be aggregator — selling both original content and offering show from channel like HBO — making them similar to traditional cable provider . Others , like AT & T and Disney , have positioned themselves a service that sell only their content — for now .
 But Netflix remains the industry leader . The company ha come a long way since it early day of mailing off DVDs in red envelope . It added 7.8 million new customer through the end of March , according to the first-quarter report it issued on Tuesday , for a total of 148 million across the globe , with 60 million in the United States . Its subscriber growth ha slowed , however , more in the United States than elsewhere , partly because of price increase and stiffening competition . The streaming service booked $ 344 million in profit on $ 4.5 billion in sale in the quarter ending in March .
 For the moment , Netflix is soundly beating it streaming rival — in subscriber , viewing time and library of content . But one is closer than the others : Hulu .
 Hulu ha long had trouble steering it own course , because it ha had to deal with multiple corporate overlord since it wa founded in 2007 .
 For much of it existence , it ownership wa split among several company : Disney , 21st Century Fox , Comcast and more recently Time Warner . The ownership of this built-by-committee digital outfit ha become le complicated in recent day .
 When Disney formally completed it acquisition of most of Fox last month , it became Hulu ’ s majority owner . Hulu rid itself of another stakeholder on Monday , when AT & T — which acquired Time Warner last year — sold the stake that once belonged to Time Warner back to Hulu . Now Disney is the controlling owner , and Comcast ha the smaller piece .
 Hulu originally made a name for itself a a next-day streamer of show from other network . That started to change a few year ago , when it got into the business of creating it own programming . Most notably , it gave the green light to “ The Handmaid ’ s Tale , ” the first streaming-native show to win an Emmy for best drama series .
 While it may not generate much hype , Hulu is Netflix ’ s closest competitor , despite some key difference between the two company .
 Almost stubbornly , Netflix sell one thing — a deep assortment of original and licensed show and film meant to please almost every niche .
 Hulu , on the other hand , ha three product that may better reflect what the future of streaming will look like . It ha a live-TV service that replicates a small cable bundle at $ 45 a month ; a video-on-demand service that sell for $ 12 a month without ad ( this one act most like Netflix ) ; and a streaming service with advertising that cost $ 6 a month .
 The last one is Hulu ’ s most lucrative business and point to future profit . Even though it charge $ 6 , the service generates more than $ 15 in revenue per subscriber each month , because of the high-cost advertising sold against those customer , according to two people familiar with the business .
 That would explain why Hulu lowered the price of the ads-based service by $ 2 this year — and it might also explain NBCUniversal ’ s interest in starting it own ad-based streaming network by 2020 .
 Roku , the maker of streaming box , is also experiencing fast growth from it advertising-driven Roku channel , a free streaming app . And in January , Viacom spent $ 340 million for PlutoTV , another ad-based streaming provider .
 Last year , Hulu took in more than $ 1.5 billion in advertising , a 45 percent jump from the previous year . Randy Freer , it chief executive , expects the ad market for online television to grow to $ 50 billion within three year .
 “ This uniquely position Hulu to benefit from leading brand into the digital video ad market , ” Mr . Freer said at Disney ’ s investor presentation last week . “ Hulu doe this with a viewer-first ad experience that ha le commercial interruption , with ad break that are shorter and ad that are more relevant . ”
 Netflix and Hulu aren ’ t necessarily either-or proposition for consumer . Many people pay for both .
 Reed Hastings , Netflix ’ s founder and chief executive , doesn ’ t anticipate that new competition will cut into Netflix ’ s business , because consumer appetite for streaming content still outpaces what ’ s currently available , or what will be available .
 “ Great competition make you better , ” he said of the newly announced competitor , Apple and Disney , in the company earnings call Tuesday . He added of all the others , “ There ’ s a ton of competition out there , which is great for consumer , and it ’ s exciting for u . ”
 While Netflix remains well in the lead , a look at the number suggests that Hulu could prove a formidable rival . Let ’ s take a look :
 Valuation : Hulu is worth $ 15 billion , Netflix $ 157 billion . But it ’ s not just about size — it ’ s important to consider how fast each ha grown relative to the other .
 When Time Warner bought a 10 percent stake in Hulu in August 2016 , it paid $ 583 million , implying a valuation of $ 5.8 billion . Nearly two year later , Disney ’ s adviser pegged Hulu at a $ 9.3 billion valuation . This month , after AT & T sold it 9.5 percent stake for $ 1.43 billion , the valuation shot up to $ 15 billion . ( Note : AT & T forfeited 0.5 percent of it stake when it didn ’ t make continued investment into Hulu . That small portion went back to Hulu . ) That mean Hulu ’ s valuation jumped by 2.6 time in two and a half year .
 Here ’ s the kicker : Netflix ’ s value grew by approximately 3.8 time in the same period . But keep in mind that , because Netflix is openly traded on the public market , it ha many more potential buyer at any given point . Hulu is effectively a private operation , with few available buyer . You have to wonder if Hulu might be more valuable if it were spun out a a separate , publicly traded company with Disney retaining a significant , or even a controlling , stake .
 Subscribers : As of December , Hulu had 25 million subscriber — eight million more than it had the previous year , a 47 percent increase . Netflix had 58 million paying member in the United States at the end of last year — a 12 percent bump from the previous year . ( Globally , Netflix had 139 million , a 26 percent increase . )
 Netflix ’ s growth ha started to slow — and markedly so , when compared with Hulu ’ s .
 Business : Both Hulu and Netflix blow through a lot of cash . Hulu ha been a money-losing operation from the start . It is expected to lose $ 1.5 billion this year and about the same next year . But Disney ha said it expects Hulu to start turning a profit by 2023 .
 Netflix record a profit on it book , but much of that come from an accounting rule that allows it to account for some cost later on down the line . It made $ 1.2 billion in profit last year and is expected to make more than $ 2 billion this year and $ 3 billion next year .
 Netflix ’ s appetite for content mean it ha to keep spending big , however , resulting in what ’ s known a “ negative free cash flow. ” More money is going out the door than coming in — a difference that Netflix cover by borrowing even more . The company burned through $ 3 billion last year and $ 2 billion the year before that . But that won ’ t last forever . The company said it planned to rely on it own revenue to fund it content starting next year .
 An earlier version of this article misquoted a word in a comment made at a Walt Disney Company investor presentation by Randy Freer , Hulu 's chief executive . Mr . Freer said expected growth in the ad market for online television `` uniquely position Hulu to benefit from leading brand into the digital video ad market , ” not that it `` uniquely position Hulu to benefit from elite brand into the digital video ad market . ”

 NEW YORK — Two congressman want Major League Baseball to produce document by April 25 tied to it attempt to purchase control of 21 regional sport network .
 The two Democrats are Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland , chairman of the House oversight and reform committee , and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois , chairman of the subcommittee on economic and consumer policy .
 They wrote to baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred on Thursday , saying they are wary of `` anticompetitive conduct . '' They asked for document on potential acquisition and operation of the regional network plus MLB 's strategy . They also want MLB official to brief committee staff .
 The Walt Disney Co. acquired 22 regional sport network a part of it $ 71 billion purchase of 21st Century Fox 's entertainment business last month . The Justice Department said last June that Disney had to sell the network a a condition of the deal . The Yankees ' YES Network is being sold separately by Disney .
 `` We are concerned that MLB 's potential expansion of it business to RSNs could increase the risk of anticompetitive conduct that harm American consumer and , in turn , baseball itself , '' the congressman wrote . `` This potential expansion also raise the question of whether additional limit on the league 's antitrust exemption are warranted . ''
 Baseball wa granted an antitrust exemption in 1922 by the Supreme Court , which ruled the sport wa not interstate commerce . Congress passed a limited cutout that wa signed into law in 1998 , making the employment of major league player subject to antitrust law .

 ( Reuters ) - Whether they prefer Elsa , SpongeBob or a Russian heroine named Masha , today 's kid have endless reason to beg for more screen time . Yet almost nobody think there is too much child 's programming .
 Media company have heavily invested in kid ’ content a they build new digital business to court consumer directly . On Thursday Walt Disney Co announced detail about Disney+ , a family-friendly streaming service it is launching in November for $ 7 per month .
 The benefit for Disney , Netflix Inc , Viacom Inc and other medium company is clear : Hook viewer when they are young , with content that often ha merchandising and theme park tie-in . And the streaming model in particular make sense : Children are the original binge-watchers , with an endless appetite for repeat .
 Yet expert who study medium consumption among child are not concerned about the explosion of programming , a long a parent impose limit , said Shelley Pasnik , the director of the nonprofit Center for Children and Technology .
 “ Parenting no longer involves relying on the finite-ness imposed by medium . Instead , it ’ s up to the parent and household rule to make it finite and help kid understand when to stop , ” Pasnik said .
 When considering their rule around screen time , parent who want to shield their kid from commercial likely see a value in ad-free service like Disney+ and Apple TV+ , Apple Inc 's upcoming streaming venture . But that format can provide false comfort : When it come to selling merchandise , content can have the same effect a commercial .
 “ Even though there are no commercial disrupting the narrative , you may not be a alert to the fact that your son or daughter is developing a great affinity for a character , and then it ’ s pretty bonkers when it come to shopping , ” say Pasnik .
 Parental control - which can be tricky to locate - are not an easy solution . Instead , expert say , parent should help their child make choice around programming ; watch with them if possible ; and talk about what they have seen , helping to connect that content to a family ’ s value .
 “ Parents need to communicate why a show is OK to watch , and help their child process the message of what they just watched , ” say Jill Murphy , vice president and editor-in-chief of the nonprofit Common Sense Media . “ It come down to quality of content . ”

 SAN FRANCISCO — Netflix kicked off the year with the biggest subscriber gain in the history of it video-streaming service , but it still managed to disappoint investor by forecasting a springtime slowdown .
 The strong first-quarter performance coincided with Netflix 's biggest U.S. price increase and emerging streaming challenge from Walt Disney and Apple , two of the world 's most popular brand .
 The video service added 9.6 million subscriber worldwide during the first quarter of 2019 , topping the projection of both Netflix 's own management and Wall Street analyst . It 's the most subscriber that Netflix ha gained during any three-month stretch since the Los Gatos , California , company unveiled it streaming service 12 year ago .
 The surge announced Tuesday left Netflix with nearly 149 million subscriber through March .
 Netflix expects to add another 5 million subscriber during the current quarter ending June , but that projection fell well below analyst ' forecast . It would also represent a decline from the 5.9 million customer that the service picked up during the same period last year .
 Netflix 's stock dipped 1 % in extended trading to $ 355.85 after the number came out .
 In a discussion streamed on video , Netflix CEO Reed Hastings likened the past quarter to a `` perfect clean shot '' down the middle of a golf course 's fairway while drawing comparison to Tiger Woods ' victory in the Masters tournament .
 Netflix tested the bound of it popularity with a recent a recent price hike that raised the cost of it most popular plan to $ 13 a month , a $ 2 increase . New U.S. subscriber had to start paying the higher price in January , but it only recently started to hit existing customer .
 The company said it doe n't expect the price increase to trigger significant cancellation , though it second-quarter forecast implies otherwise . It expects to add just 300,000 U.S. subscriber from April through June , down from 700,000 at the same time last year .
 Competition facing Netflix will heat up toward the end of this year when both Disney and Apple plan to start selling their own video-streaming service backed by big budget .
 Disney 's offering , due out in November , could be a bigger threat because it will feature a library of classic film supplemented with original programming cooked up by a company with a proven record of churning out crowd-pleasing entertainment . What 's more , the service — called Disney Plus — initially will cost just $ 7 per month .
 Apple ha n't disclosed the pricing of it service , which will include program featuring renowned star such a Oprah Winfrey , Jennifer Anniston and Jason Momoa , nor a specific date for it debut .
 `` There 's a ton of competition out there , and Disney and Apple add a little bit more but frankly , I doubt it will be material , '' Hastings said .
 Besides the good news on subscriber , Netflix 's first-quarter profit of $ 344 million rose 19 % from the same time last year ; it included a $ 58 million gain from currency adjustment . The company earned 76 cent per share during the first quarter , 18 cent above the estimate among analyst polled by FactSet .
 Netflix 's revenue climbed 22 % to $ 4.5 billion .
 But the company continues to spend more cash than it is bringing in a it pours money into a lineup of TV series and film that ha been attracting more subscriber . The company burned through another $ 460 million in the quarter and expects it negative cash flow this year to exceed last year 's total of a negative $ 3.5 billion .

 NEW YORK — With more TV streaming service than ever before , from newcomer like Disney Plus to stalwart like Netflix , consumer may feel the ideal viewing experience is finally at hand .
 Americans have , on average , three streaming video subscription service , according to a recent study of digital medium trend by Deloitte . While some have dropped cable and it average bill of around $ 100 a month altogether , about 43 % have both pay TV and streaming subscription .
 Yet patching together a variety of service to get just what one want is n't always seamless . Families and individual can still find themselves with service that doe n't perfectly suit their viewing habit . And those monthly subscription can add up fast .
 `` It doe n't make sense to pay for a bunch of content you have no interest in watching , '' said Bruce McClary , vice president of marketing for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling . `` Finding a service that let you scale your channel lineup based on your interest can also help you avoid paying for thing you do n't need . ''
 A little research on which service are best for you can help save big buck .
 FOR FAMILIES
 Disney is making the biggest play for family viewership . The owner of Disney Channel , the Star Wars franchise and most recently Fox 's entertainment business is betting it mix of family-friendly franchise and beloved animated classic , along with original programming , will make the Disney Plus service irresistible to family , even if they already subscribe to other service . The service , launching Nov. 12 , will cost $ 7 a month initially .
 For some kid , there may be no substitute for watching Disney 's `` Frozen '' over and over again . But other service that family might already subscribe to have a lot of family-friendly programming too . Amazon Prime ( $ 119 per year or $ 13 per month for Prime loyalty program membership ; Prime Video alone cost $ 9 a month ) , Hulu ( $ 6 to $ 12 per month ) , and Netflix ( $ 9 to $ 16 per month ) all offer kid programming .
 Another choice for parent : HBO Now ( $ 15 a month ) is the home for the classic kid TV show `` Sesame Street . '' And for spendthrift , YouTube 's free Kids channel offer an endless stream of kid-friendly fare , although quality varies widely .
 FOR MOVIE BUFFS
 Movie fan will soon have to work a bit harder to find movie to stream . As Disney , Fox , Universal and Warner Brothers and others offer their own streaming service , they will all eventually pull their content from Netflix . But niche service are there to fill the void .
 Classic movie can be difficult to find streaming . Movie fan suffered a loss when AT & T , which bought Time Warner last year , decided to discontinue FilmStruck , a streaming service that wa a collaboration between Turner Classic Movies and the Criterion Collection . But a similar service called The Criterion Channel that offer 1,000 classic and contemporary film is stepping up to fill the void . It cost $ 11 a month or $ 99 for a year .
 Other movie-centric streaming service include Fandor ( $ 6 per month or $ 50 per year ) or Mubi ( $ 11 per month ) . Both offer a curated selection of movie .
 Those on a budget can try Kanopy , a streaming service that work with public library and university to offer library card holder streaming movie for free .
 FOR SPORTS FANS
 Sports fan do have streaming option , but they cost more since sport must be watched live . Basic live TV option are cheaper but may not include sport channel . Which service you choose depends on which sport or which team you want to watch .
 There are a variety of live TV streaming service that offer a wide range of sport , but they 've recently been raising their price . Fubo TV offer more than 85 channel including one that broadcast football , baseball , soccer and other sport . It cost $ 45 for the first month , then $ 55 a month after that . DirecTV Now cost $ 50 a month for the cheapest tier . Sling TV cost $ 25 to $ 40 a month . Hulu raised the price for it live-TV service in February , by $ 5 , to $ 45 . Sony 's PlayStation Vue cost $ 45 to $ 80 a month . Google 's YouTube TV is increasing it monthly fee to $ 50 . It launched at $ 35 and ha raised price a it added more channel . Most of the live TV service offer the major sport channel such a Fox Sports and NBC Sports Network , a well a game broadcast on network TV . But ESPN , for example , is on Hulu Live and YouTube TV but not Fubo TV , so fan of a specific team or sport should examine the channel listing for each service .
 There 's no budget offering for watching high profile sporting event . But Disney 's ESPN Plus cost $ 5 a month or $ 50 for the year . It offer some live game , including some hockey , soccer and baseball game , a well a content about sport like ESPN 's `` 30 for 30 '' documentary series . But you ca n't watch most major league sport game on the service .
 MIX AND MATCH
 If you 're a sport fan who also love movie and ha a family , you 'll have to mix and match service while trying to stay within your budget . It is still possible to stay below the monthly cost of cable , say the NFCC 's McClary .
 `` The acceptable threshold for spending is up to each household , but most 'live ' and 'on demand ' streaming service would be on the low end of the scale compared to traditional cable package , '' he said . `` One good measuring stick is to compare the monthly rate to your monthly content consumption pattern and what it would cost if you paid movie rental rate each time you watch a program .

 ( Reuters ) - Hulu ha bought back wireless carrier AT & T Inc 's stake in the U.S. entertainment streaming service for $ 1.43 billion , in a deal that value Hulu at $ 15 billion , the two company said on Monday .
 The sale of AT & T 's 9.5 percent stake to Hulu in a cash deal give Walt Disney Co , which hold a 60 percent stake in Hulu via a joint venture , more control of the company .
 Comcast Corp 's NBCUniversal ha a 30 percent stake in Hulu . Based on the joint venture agreement , Disney and Comcast will decide how they want to allocate the share bought from AT & T .

 The Public Theater is known for it work with Shakespeare a well a many of the titan of contemporary theater .
 This summer , it ’ s going to tackle a different corner of the canon : Disney .
 The Public announced Wednesday that it would mount a stage adaptation of “ Hercules , ” based on the 1997 Disney animated musical , a part of it Public Works initiative for a short run in the day surrounding Labor Day weekend .
 The production , at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park , mark the first time the Public , which a the birthplace of “ A Chorus Line ” and “ Hamilton ” is arguably the nation ’ s most successful nonprofit theater , will work with Disney , which is among the world ’ s most successful entertainment company .
 The adaptation will feature song from the film , a well a new number , by Alan Menken and David Zippel , and a new book by Kristoffer Diaz ; it will be directed by Lear deBessonet . “ Hercules ” is scheduled to run Aug. 31-Sept. 8 .
 Public Works show are exuberant musical featuring professional actor along with score of amateur performer drawn from New York ’ s five borough ; the format is rapidly expanding — it ha already been adopted in Dallas , London and Seattle , and is about to add seven more American partner .
 The Public said that the root of “ Hercules ” in Greek mythology make it a good fit for the Public Works program , which stage musical adaptation of classic work , and which previously featured a production of “ The Odyssey . ”
 “ Its populist musical treatment of a classical story about a hero ’ s journey felt very specific to Public Works , ” said Ms. deBessonet , who founded Public Works .
 “ I saw buried in the story these element that subvert a traditional narrative of what a hero is , and what strength is , ” she said . “ The thing we externally celebrate a being heroic is not real strength — there ’ s a much deeper journey . ”
 “ Hercules ” will be the sixth title adapted by Public Works over the last seven year . Ms. deBessonet said she had been thinking about attempting to adapt a Disney title since the start of the program , after realizing that Disney musical film told story universally recognized by the program ’ s participant .
 “ There is this shared American canon that cut across all kind of demographic , and it is Disney musical , ” she said . “ I grew up in Baton Rouge , La. , and Disney musical were my intro to musical theater , a well — I didn ’ t have any exposure to other professional theater until I wa 17 . ”
 The “ Hercules ” production will follow two Shakespeare title that will make up the Public Theater ’ s annual Shakespeare in the Park series : “ Much Ado About Nothing , ” directed by Kenny Leon , from May 21 to June 23 , and “ Coriolanus , ” directed by Daniel Sullivan , from July 16 to August 11 .
 Both the Shakespeare in the Park title and the Public Works show are free to the general public ; ticket are available in person or by digital lottery .

 A private arbitrator ruled this month that Fox must pay the extraordinary sum of $ 178.7 million to former producer and star of the procedural crime television series “ Bones ” in a dispute over profit participation .
 The award spotlight a longstanding gripe among even well-compensated Hollywood player over the value of their work , especially a deep-pocketed newcomer like Netflix , Hulu , Amazon and Apple come courting . Studios have often been criticized for what some consider questionable accounting practice that cut into back-end payouts .
 The ruling spilled into public view on Wednesday after the plaintiff in the case filed a petition to confirm the arbitration award in Los Angeles Superior Court .
 The arbitrator , Peter D. Lichtman , said that Fox pocketed ten of million of dollar that should have gone to the “ Bones ” team . He ordered Fox to pay the plaintiff $ 50 million in damage and an additional $ 128 million in punitive damage . Fox is contesting the $ 128 million ruling .
 In his 66-page ruling , the arbitrator accused several Fox senior executive — including the 21st Century Fox president Peter Rice and the Fox Television Group co-chief executive Dana Walden — of perjuring themselves . Mr. Lichtman said that those executive “ appear to have given false testimony in an attempt to conceal their wrongful act ” and accused them of a “ pattern of deceit . ”
 “ The arbitrator is convinced that perjury wa committed by the Fox witness , ” Mr. Lichtman wrote .
 Arbitration hearing are meant to be private and rarely come to light . Fox executive , however , were stunned by the ruling , which they saw a heavily one-sided , according to two people with direct knowledge of their thinking . The opinion left the company little leverage to negotiate a settlement , and the executive decided to contest the damage , the people said . That would also require public scrutiny before a judge .
 In a statement , 21st Century Fox said , “ The ruling by this private arbitrator is categorically wrong on the merit and exceeded his arbitration power . Fox will not allow this flagrant injustice , riddled with error and gratuitous character attack , to stand and will vigorously challenge the ruling in a court of law . ”
 “ Bones , ” an hourlong crime show , wa a sturdy hit for Fox from 2005 to 2017 . It starred Emily Deschanel and David Boreanaz , both of whom were plaintiff in the case , along with the executive producer Barry Josephson and the writer Kathy Reichs , who wrote the novel the series wa based on .
 An arbitration hearing requires both side to agree to the term of possible damage beforehand . The plaintiff and defendant also agree in advance to abide by the ruling , without the recourse of an appeal , a in a court trial . But a party can contest an arbitration judgment if it determines that an arbitrator ha awarded damage that fall outside the agreed upon term .
 Complicating matter is that both Mr. Rice and Ms. Walden are week away from moving into senior leadership role at the Walt Disney Company after it close on it purchase of the bulk of 21st Century Fox ’ s entertainment property .
 Fox ha been under the leadership of it chairman , Rupert Murdoch , who built his medium empire over more than six decade . Last year he agreed to sell the majority of his business to Disney for $ 71.3 billion . As part of the transaction , Mr. Rice is poised to become the chairman of Walt Disney Television and Ms. Walden will become the chairwoman of Disney Television Studios and ABC Entertainment .
 Hours after the ruling become public , Disney ’ s chief executive , Robert A. Iger , defended his incoming senior executive .
 “ Peter Rice and Dana Walden are highly respected leader in this industry , and we have complete confidence in their character and integrity , ” Mr. Iger said in a statement . “ Disney had no involvement in the arbitration , and we understand the decision is being challenged and will leave it to the court to decide the matter . ”
 At minimum , the producer and the star of “ Bones ” will be awarded $ 50 million in damage , but it ’ s unclear who will be on the hook for that payment . The plaintiff sued Fox ’ s television studio , which produced the show ; the broadcast network , which aired the show ; and 21st Century Fox , the studio and network ’ s parent company .
 In the coming week , Fox ’ s television studio will become part of Disney but the broadcast network will remain with Mr. Murdoch a part of a smaller company to be named Fox Corporation . Both Disney and Fox did not offer any explanation for who would be responsible for payment .
 The extraordinary award for damage ha piqued the interest of the creative set in Hollywood . The entertainment industry ha undergone a remarkable change with Netflix , Hulu , Facebook , Amazon and Apple cutting big check for original content . Older fare ha also become incredibly valuable . Netflix paid about $ 100 million to keep “ Friends ” for at least another year . The show , a decade-long hit for NBC , went off the air in 2004 .
 But a streaming service become more dominant , the economics of entertainment have become more opaque . Producers have struggled to understand how to value their work on a service like Netflix , which rarely offer data on viewership . Hulu , a joint venture whose owner include both Fox and Disney , is buying right to show from it own investor . The “ Bones ” arbitrator ha suggested Fox wa self-dealing when it sold the show ’ s digital right to Hulu , potentially depriving the plaintiff of million in extra fee .
 The case is scheduled to move from the shadow of arbitration to a Los Angeles courtroom in late April . The “ Bones ” team will seek to collect it money , while Fox is looking to vacate the $ 128 million ruling .
 “ We are so proud of the hard work we did on ‘ Bones ’ for 12 season and only ever wanted Fox to live up to it promise and contractual obligation , ” said Ms. Deschanel . “ I am grateful that such a well-respected arbitrator reviewed the fact so thoroughly before ruling the way he did . I look forward to the legal system continuing to hold Fox accountable so that we can all move forward . ”

 In his live-action remake of Disney ’ s “ Dumbo , ” Tim Burton play with a legacy that he ha helped burnish for decade , only to set it gleefully ablaze . Ho-hum until it take a turn toward the fascinatingly weird , the movie is a welcome declaration of artistic independence for Burton , who often strain against aesthetic and industrial restriction . Watching him cut loose ( more recklessly than his flying baby elephant ) is by far the most unexpected pleasure of this movie , which dust off the 1941 animated charmer with exhilaratingly demented spirit .
 One of Disney ’ s simplest , sweetest heart-tuggers ( with some queasy racial stereotype ) , the original “ Dumbo ” tell the story of a wee circus elephant whose enormous flappy ear enable him to fly . Based on a child ’ s book , it wa made fast and proved a terrific success . The straightforward story might not have seemed an obvious choice for an auteurist project , particularly given this one ’ s cultivated eccentricity . But “ Dumbo ” is among the seemingly endless number of animated movie that Disney is giving a live-action makeover : “ Jungle Book , ” “ The Lion King , ” “ Aladdin , ” “ Mulan , ” “ The Sword in the Stone , ” and on and on until the end of the world ( or movie ) a we know it .
 For roughly the first half-hour of the new “ Dumbo , ” Burton seems on autopilot a he introduces the character and set the old-timey scene with an otherworldly pale palette . ( The script is by Ehren Kruger , whose credit include “ The Brothers Grimm ” and several “ Transformers ” movie . ) The story open in 1919 at a down-and-out circus owned by Max Medici ( Danny DeVito , pumping life into his scene ) , a ringmaster who presides over the movie ’ s busily milling , child-friendly freak and geek . By the time an earnest , tamped-down Colin Farrell enters a Holt , a big-tent trick rider turned disabled World War I veteran , the near two-hour running time feel a lot like a threat .
 [ Need help deciding what movie or TV show to stream next ? Subscribe to our Watching newsletter . ]
 Things pick up when baby Dumbo arrives in a makeshift birthing bed . Now a digital cutie with gargantuan ear that hang off each side of his head like heavy leather curtain , the newest , littlest circus addition is conspicuously more animal than his childlike antecedent . Like the original , this Dumbo doesn ’ t speak , which perhaps is why Burton focus on his unnaturally large , expressive eye . ( He ’ s an Indian elephant , so his trunk ha one searching finger . ) Those eye moisten a lot , including when Holt ’ s drearily conceptualized and motherless — of course ! — child ( Nico Parker and Finley Hobbins ) comfort Dumbo after his protective mom is sent to elephant jail .
 In time , the kid help teach Dumbo to fly , coaxing him with a feather he snuffle into his trunk : He sneeze , and the exhalation sends him up . When he finally achieves genuine liftoff , soaring around the interior of the circus ’ s one-ring tent , Burton doe , too . It ’ s ticklish fun to watch baby elephant of any kind , including an airborne one . That ’ s true even if Dumbo ’ s flight prove increasingly bleak because he ’ s at the mercy of some very bad people . Humans are secondary attraction in the 1941 movie ( it animal are people proxy ) but they crowd the remake . Most are just generic placeholder , but a few are strikingly brutal exploiter , none more so than V. A. Vandevere , a subversive invention .
 Played by Michael Keaton in full live-wire mode , Vandevere is a stereotypical Richie Rich screen villain with a shadowy lair ; dark design ; a wolfish smile ; and a silky , possibly fatal femme , Colette ( Eva Green , who add some steel filament to a bauble ) . Keaton make the character more memorable than most anyone here ; Vandevere seems ready to dangerously pop . What make him particularly arresting , though , is that he owns a sprawling , impersonal amusement park named Dreamland that is filled with menace and with attraction — Nightmare Island , Wonders of Science , Rocket to the Future and the ominously named Colosseum — that suggest a Disneyland Bizarro World .
 At first , Dreamland seems like just another reflexive flourish in a film about a group of ragtag struggling entertainer rescued by a star . There are a lot of movie about movie , and the default is generally self-flattering even at it most cynical . Disney ’ s have long been de facto advertisement for the company ’ s even more profitable offscreen world ; it animated “ Hercules ” actually feature a Hercules Store with merch that mirror the stuff sold offscreen . In “ Dumbo , ” Burton take this self-referential impulse to a startling level through the representation of it Walt Disney-style impresario — who speaks of magic and mystique — and then by lighting the whole shebang on fire .
 By the time Holt is galloping through flame and Vandevere is threatening to kill Dumbo ’ s mom — matricide being a studio signature — the movie ha gone enjoyably bonkers . The animal are roaring , the worker are revolting , and Burton ha merrily turned what could have been another remake into something genuinely different and surprising . What exactly it is will partly depend on your view toward Disney . So it ’ s worth noting that for all the tumult and fury , this can also feel a bit like a bittersweet origin story : 1919 wa the same year that the teenage Walt returned from war and wa hired by a commercial art shop where he met Ub Iwerks , who helped create Mickey Mouse .
 “ They ’ re paying me to draw picture , ” Walt said , voicing the joy of creation that is too often missing in his company ’ s later movie but here burn with a vengeance .

 Amazon is coming to New York — to grab a piece of the Yankees sport network .
 Jeff Bezos ’ s tech giant ha teamed up with the storied baseball organization in an effort to buy the YES Network from it majority owner , 21st Century Fox , according to two people close to negotiation who declined to be identified because the deal wasn ’ t yet official . If it go forward in it current form , the deal is expected to take a few month to close .
 The Yankees will become the largest shareholder in the channel , a regional sports-focused network serving the New York metropolitan area that ha been valued at just under $ 3.5 billion , the people said . That ’ s le than the approximately $ 4 billion it wa worth five year ago , when 21st Century Fox increased it stake to 80 percent .
 Joining the deal are Sinclair Broadcasting , Redbird Capital , the Blackstone Group and others .
 The YES network wa borne out of a partnership struck in 1999 between the Yankees and the Nets basketball franchise . The Yankees , whose business operation ha been led by Randy L. Levine , it president since 2000 , formally took over the project in 2004 and sold a 49 percent stake to Rupert Murdoch ’ s 21st Century Fox in 2012 . A second deal , in 2014 , gave the Murdoch company control of the company and left the Yankees with a 20 percent stake .
 The Walt Disney Company , the new owner of most 21st Century Fox asset , is managing the current deal a part of it plan to sell YES along with 21 other regional sport network . The sell-off of those property wa a condition of the Justice Department ’ s approval of Disney ’ s $ 71.3 billion acquisition of the 21st Century Fox asset last summer .
 The company involved in the deal declined to comment on Friday .
 Media right to sport franchise are incredibly lucrative , but their value on traditional cable system ha waned a fewer people are willing to pay for traditional TV . A large part of the upside in sport right now come from streaming . For Amazon , owning a piece of YES could be a boon to it Prime program ( which cost $ 119 a year ) , especially if that membership included access to those game . That , in turn , could add more revenue , a Prime member tend to buy more on Amazon than casual online shopper .
 Amazon ’ s motivation becomes clearer when considering the fact that growth in the number of Amazon Prime member in the United States ha slowed recently . It hit 97 million member last year , up from about 90 million in 2017 , according to an estimate from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners .
 Amazon already stream “ Thursday Night Football ” on Prime , for which it had paid $ 50 million for one N.F.L . season . The company renewed that agreement in April for two more year in a deal worth $ 130 million , a 30 percent increase .
 With the rise of streaming , regional sport network have found themselves in a tricky position . They are effectively the middleman of sport right ; they get money from cable and satellite company to carry the network , but they , in turn , have to pay sport league for the right to broadcast the game . Lately , cable and satellite company have tried to pay le to carry these network , given the decline in subscriber — but the sport team are set to receive contractual rate increase every year .
 Unlike broadcast right , which are controlled by the team , local streaming right are controlled by Major League Baseball . YES , and other regional sport network , ha the right to show game online through the 2019 season , but how those right will be controlled going forward is unclear . That could dampen the long-term value of regional sport network . YES , however , could benefit from the fact that it is partly owned by the Yankees . M.L.B . ha been trying to extract more lucrative term from internet and broadcast company for streaming , like the N.F.L . doe , and it could end up granting those right to the club themselves to help stoke new deal .
 Disney , along with AT & T and NBCUniversal , plan an aggressive move into streaming by the end of this year . Its deal for most of 21st Century Fox wa a keystone to that plan . Fox ’ s regional sport network would have become the “ perfect complement ” to Disney ’ s ESPN , the company ’ s chief executive , Robert A. Iger , said when announcing the deal in December 2017 . But the Justice Department disagreed , and the two company did not challenge the condition on the merger imposed by the government . Disney already ha a sport streaming app called ESPN+ that ha more than two million subscriber and will become an integral part of the company ’ s larger streaming strategy .
 Disney ’ s acquisition ha not formally closed yet , and the company ha 90 day after the merger is official to sell the sport channel . The company already ha approval from shareholder and regulatory body in the region in which it operates .

 Using 150 interview on three continent , The Times describes the Murdoch family ’ s role in destabilizing democracy in North America , Europe and Australia .
 By LIAM STACK APRIL 3 , 2019
 Rupert Murdoch , the founder of a global medium empire that includes Fox News , ha said he “ never asked a prime minister for anything . ”
 But that empire ha given him influence over world affair in a way few private citizen ever have , granting the Murdoch family enormous sway over not just the United States , but English-speaking country around the world .
 A six-month investigation by The New York Times covering three continent and including more than 150 interview ha described how Mr. Murdoch and his feuding son turned their medium outlet into right-wing political influence machine that have destabilized democracy in North America , Europe and Australia .
 Here are some key takeaway from The Times ’ s investigation into the Murdoch family and it role in the illiberal , right-wing political wave sweeping the globe .
 Fox News ha long exerted a gravitational pull on the Republican Party in the United States , where it most recently amplified the nativist revolt that ha fueled the rise of the far right and the election of President Trump .
 Mr. Murdoch ’ s newspaper The Sun spent year demonizing the European Union to it reader in Britain , where it helped lead the Brexit campaign that persuaded a slim majority of voter in a 2016 referendum to endorse pulling out of the bloc . Political havoc ha reigned in Britain ever since .
 [ Read the complete investigation into the Murdoch family . ]
 And in Australia , where his hold over the medium is most extensive , Mr. Murdoch ’ s outlet pushed for the repeal of the country ’ s carbon tax and helped topple a series of prime minister whose agenda he disliked , including Malcolm Turnbull last year .
 At the center of this upheaval sits the Murdoch family , a clan whose dysfunction ha both shaped and mirrored the global tumult of recent year .
 The Times explored those family dynamic and their impact on the Murdoch empire , which is on the cusp of succession a it 88-year-old patriarch prepares to hand power to the son whose politics most resemble his own : Lachlan Murdoch .
 A key step in that succession ha paradoxically been the partial dismemberment of the empire , which significantly shrunk last month when Mr. Murdoch sold one of his company , the film studio 21st Century Fox , to the Walt Disney Company for $ 71.3 billion .
 The deal turned Mr. Murdoch ’ s child into billionaire and left Lachlan in control of a powerful political weapon : a streamlined company , the Fox Corporation , whose most potent asset is Fox News .
 Succession ha been a source of tension in the Murdoch family for year , particularly between Mr. Murdoch ’ s son Lachlan and James .
 His two son are very different people . James wanted the company to become more digitally focused and more politically moderate , while Lachlan wanted to lean into the reactionary politics of the moment .
 [ Read the complete investigation into the Murdoch family . ]
 The brother have spent their life competing to succeed their father , and both men felt a if they had earned the top job . When Mr. Murdoch decided to promote Lachlan over James , it wa Lachlan who delivered the news to James over lunch , souring the already poor relationship between the men .
 James briefly quit the company in protest . But he wa lured back by a carefully crafted compromise that put Lachlan in charge but allowed James to save face by maintaining the public illusion that he wa the heir .
 But all of these succession plan — a well a the lucrative Disney deal — were thrown into chaos last year when Mr. Murdoch broke his spine and collapsed on a yacht .
 He wa rushed to a hospital , and appeared to be so close to death that his wife , the model Jerry Hall , summoned his child to say their goodbye .
 Mr. Murdoch survived , but his brush with death only highlighted the instability in his family — and at the heart of his empire .
 Mr. Murdoch ’ s medium outlet have promoted right-wing politics and stoked reactionary populism across the globe in recent year .
 During the 2016 campaign , the Fox News host Sean Hannity advised the president ’ s former lawyer , Michael D. Cohen , to be on the lookout for ex-girlfriends or former employee of Mr. Trump lest they cause him trouble , according to two people who know about the interaction ( Hannity denies offering such advice ) . Mr. Cohen wa later sentenced to three year in prison for paying hush money to two woman who said they had affair with Mr. Trump .
 [ Read the complete investigation into the Murdoch family . ]
 The Murdoch empire ha also boldly flexed it muscle in Australia , which wa for many year Lachlan ’ s domain .
 In Australia , Lachlan expressed disdain for effort to fight climate change and once rebuked the staff at one of his family ’ s newspaper , The Australian , for an editorial in support of same-sex marriage ( He say through a representative that he is in favor of same-sex marriage ) . He also became close to the politician Tony Abbott , whose 2013 election a prime minister wa given an assist by Murdoch newspaper .
 The Murdoch family changed Australian politics in 2016 when it took control of Sky News Australia and imported the Fox News model . They quickly introduced a slate of right-wing opinion show that often focused on race , immigration and climate change . The programming became known a Sky After Dark .
 Last year , Mr. Turnbull and his staff accused Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch of using their medium outlet to help foment the intraparty coup that thrust him from office in August . Mr. Turnbull , a moderate and longtime nemesis of his friend Mr. Abbott , wa replaced by the right-wing nationalist Scott Morrison .
 The Murdochs have denied any role in Mr. Turnbull ’ s downfall .
 James Murdoch became disillusioned with the family empire in the year before Lachlan emerged a heir . He came to see Fox News , in particular , a a source of damaging ideological baggage that wa hobbling the company ’ s effort to innovate and grow .
 But Lachlan and Rupert did not share that belief . When Roger Ailes , the chief executive of Fox News , wa ousted in 2016 amid a sexual harassment scandal , James wanted to revamp the network a a le partisan news outlet . He even floated the idea of hiring David Rhodes , a CBS executive .
 [ Read the complete investigation into the Murdoch family . ]
 His proposal went nowhere . Lachlan and Rupert opposed any change to what they saw a a winning formula and decided to stick with Fox ’ s incendiary programming .
 But James believed he had seen firsthand the damage that outlet like Fox News were doing to the company .
 He wa the face of the Murdoch empire in Britain during a 2010 attempt to take over British Sky Broadcasting , in which the company owned a minority stake .
 That bid wa blown to piece by the 2011 phone hacking scandal , which forced James and his father to appear before Parliament to explain why their employee hacked into the voice mail of private citizen , including a dead 13-year-old girl . The scandal forced the Murdochs to abandon their bid for Sky .
 Five year later , facing pressure from digital rival like Netflix and Amazon , the family made a second bid for Sky . James again acted a the empire ’ s public face . The bid again collapsed in a humiliating scandal .
 This time it centered on the culture of Fox News , where sexual misconduct allegation and million of dollar in secret settlement led to the departure of Mr. Ailes , the star host Bill O ’ Reilly and Bill Shine , an executive who later went to work for President Trump .
 The behavior of Mr. Hannity , who used his show to spread conspiracy theory about the death of a Democratic National Committee staff member named Seth Rich , also fed concern in Britain over the ethic of the company .
 After month of review by regulator — and scrambling inside 21st Century Fox — the British government issued a withering rebuke to the Murdochs last year .
 Not only did Britain block the company ’ s bid for Sky , it also ruled that no member of the Murdoch family could serve at Sky in any capacity , including on it board . At the time , James wa serving a Sky ’ s chairman .
 It wa a deep humiliation that convinced James once and for all that the family empire could not survive it own politics and culture . Lachlan instead saw it a validation of his belief that James , having failed to acquire Sky once , had been the wrong man for the job .
 Either way , by putting a much-needed revenue stream permanently outside the family ’ s grasp , it helped make the sale of 21st Century Fox inevitable .
 James and Lachlan were bitterly split over the prospect of selling 21st Century Fox to Disney . James pushed hard for the deal , which wa completed last month , and Lachlan fiercely opposed it .
 Lachlan vociferously opposed the deal because it substantially shrank the company he returned from Australia to one day lead , people closer to his brother said . He felt so strongly that at one point he warned his father he would stop speaking to him if he continued to pursue the deal . Mr. Murdoch ignored that threat . ( Lachlan denied making the threat . )
 [ Read the complete investigation into the Murdoch family . ]
 Lachlan ’ s opposition wa also fueled in part by his suspicion that his brother ’ s judgment had been clouded by personal ambition , people closer to Lachlan said . He thought James wa willing to sell 21st Century Fox for le than it wa worth because he wanted the deal to include a job for himself at Disney .
 The deal transformed Disney into a medium colossus , and a job there might have enabled James to position himself a a successor to it chief executive , Robert A. Iger . It would also let him escape the family company , it political baggage and the prospect of working for Lachlan .
 The two brother clashed over everything . When James wanted to respond to President Trump ’ s 2017 travel ban with a statement reassuring their company ’ s Muslim employee , Lachlan strenuously resisted . When James bought their father ’ s Beverly Hills mansion for $ 30 million , Lachlan , who had also wanted the house , got so upset that their father gave him some of it antique furniture . James thought he had bought that , too .
 During the Disney negotiation , Mr. Murdoch grew concerned enough that James ’ s ambition might interfere with the deal that he decided to assure Mr. Iger that it wa not conditional upon Disney ’ s hiring his son . In the end , the sale went through , but James did not get a job . Today , the two brother are barely on speaking term .
 After the Disney deal , the commitment of Mr. Murdoch ’ s child to what remains of his medium empire ha been called into question .
 The Disney deal made all of them an enormous amount of money : Mr. Murdoch received $ 4 billion and his child received $ 2 billion each . As executive at 21st Century Fox , Lachlan and James got an additional $ 20 million in Disney stock plus golden parachute worth $ 70 million each .
 [ Read the complete investigation into the Murdoch family . ]
 Mr. Murdoch had structured his company , 21st Century Fox and News Corporation , so that the Murdoch Family Trust held a controlling interest in them . He held half of the trust ’ s eight vote , and the remaining four were divided up among his four adult child . They were barred from selling those share to outsider .
 James struck out on his own at the end of 2018 . To make a more complete break with the company , he and his sister Elisabeth and Prudence offered to sell their share to Lachlan .
 Mr. Murdoch embraced the idea and urged Lachlan to buy out his sibling . Then father and son would own the company together .
 Bankers drew up document to execute the sale , but Lachlan backed out ; he said that it wa not financially doable , though the decision raised question about his commitment to the company .
 People close to James said they believed Lachlan wa not sure he wanted to stay at the company after the Disney deal wa complete . They said he might even want to go back to Australia .

 “ Dumbo ” wa no runt — but it wa no mammoth hit , either .
 Nearly eight decade after the 1941 original , Disney ’ s live-action “ Dumbo ” arrived in theater this weekend to $ 45 million in ticket sale , topping the domestic box office . But that figure fell slightly below analyst ’ expectation of around $ 50 million , and overall made for a moderately disappointing opening for the Tim Burton film , which reportedly had a production budget of $ 170 million . An additional $ 71 million in overseas sale brings it global weekend total to $ 116 million .
 Like the animated original , Burton ’ s “ Dumbo ” follows the trial and eventual triumph of an elephant outcast . Unlike the original , the new film is led by famous flesh-and-blood actor : Danny DeVito , Colin Farrell , Eva Green and Michael Keaton . It ’ s a darker ( if PG-rated ) take on the story , with DeVito playing the owner of a scrappy circus that get bought by a powerful big-city entrepreneur and amusement-park owner ( Keaton ) , who intends to exploit the circus ’ s discovery of Dumbo , the flying elephant .
 [ Read our critic ’ s review of “ Dumbo . ” ]
 “ Dumbo ” is the latest in a string of live-action , C.G.I.-buttressed Disney remake . Its slight underperformance may be due in part to the unenthusiastic reception it received from most critic — it currently hold a 50 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes . By comparison , last year ’ s Winnie-the-Pooh tale from Disney , “ Christopher Robin , ” received 72 percent positive review , and 2017 ’ s live-action “ Beauty and the Beast ” hold 71 percent . Remakes of “ Aladdin ” and “ The Lion King ” are slated for release later this year .
 There probably wasn ’ t much competition between “ Dumbo ” and this weekend ’ s other big movie .
 Universal ’ s “ Us , ” Jordan ’ s Peele ’ s family-unfriendly follow-up to his landmark 2017 feature debut , “ Get Out , ” easily landed in second place , selling $ 33.6 million in ticket according to Comscore , which compiles box-office data . That ’ s more than enough to send it cumulative sale past the $ 100 million mark : after two weekend , the film ha now made about $ 128.2 million domestically .
 That put “ Us ” slightly ahead of where 2018 ’ s “ Halloween ” wa after it second weekend . “ Halloween , ” which carried both the name recognition and baggage of a 40-year-old franchise , had a North American total of about $ 126.7 million by that point . But it also had a significantly higher debut weekend ( $ 77.5 million versus the $ 70.3 million brought in by “ Us ” ) .
 The other newcomer in the top five wa Pure Flix ’ s “ Unplanned , ” an R-rated Christian drama about a young woman who found an anti-abortion organization . That movie opened to $ 6.1 million this weekend , landing in fifth place . Neon ’ s “ The Beach Bum , ” the latest comedy from the director Harmony Korine which star Matthew McConaughey a a Florida pothead , flopped with just $ 1.8 million in domestic sale .

 NEW YORK — The Notre-Dame de Paris , which sustained a devastating fire Monday , ha inspired writer , painter and filmmaker for hundred of year . Here are some notable example :
 PAINTING : Henri Matisse painted it often— in intimate blue , a distant green , a pinkish haze . It served a a melancholy backdrop for William-Adolphe Bouguereau 's `` The Bohemian , '' while the interior provided a golden , grandiose aura for Jacques-Louis David 's `` The Coronation of Napoleon . ''
 BOOKS : Think of book about Notre Dame and you 'll inevitably begin with Victor Hugo 's `` Notre-Dame of Paris '' ( otherwise known a `` The Hunchback of Notre-Dame '' ) , his 1831 masterpiece . But Notre Dame also appears in work ranging from Balzac 's `` The Wrong Side of Paris '' to the `` Babar '' and `` Madeline '' child 's series .
 MOVIES : It 's there , of course , in the adaptation of Hugo 's novel , whether the 1939 version starring Charles Laughton , the 1956 remake with Anthony Quinn or the 1996 Disney musical featuring the voice of Tom Hulce and Demi Moore among others . You 'll spot it , too , in the background a Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn converse in `` Charade , '' and a Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy cruise along the Seine in `` Before Sunset , '' a Hawke marvel at it surviving the Nazi occupation of World War II and Delpy responds , `` But you have to think that Notre Dame will be gone one day . ''
 MUSIC : `` Dark wa the night when our tale wa begun/On the dock near Notre Dame , '' sing David Ogden Stiers , Paul Kandel and Tony Jay in the Disney film , the soundtrack composed by Alan Menken . In ABBA 's `` One Last Summer , '' it 's a sentimental detail ( `` In the tourist jam , round the Notre-Dame/Our last summer/Walking hand in hand '' ) . It 's an object of awe in Garland Jefferies ' `` Jump Jump '' ( `` We pas Notre Dame/So much history/So much bigger than me '' ) and a brooding symbol in Roxy Music 's `` Europe '' ( `` And here by the Seine/Notre Dame casts/A long lonely shadow '' ) .

 `` No one is ever really gone , '' say the voice of Luke Skywalker in the first teaser trailer for `` Star Wars : Episode IX , '' which audience finally learned will be called `` Star Wars : The Rise of Skywalker '' Friday at a fan event in Chicago .
 The closely guarded film from director J.J. Abrams will put an end to the Skywalker saga that began over 40 year ago , but even a character and actor have passed on , the footage shown at Star Wars Celebration suggests that a with all `` Star Wars '' film , death is just a technicality a long time ago in a galaxy far , far away .
 Mark Hamill 's Skywalker may have died at the end of the most recent installment but his voice dominates the teaser trailer , telling someone , possibly Daisy Ridley 's Rey , that , `` this is your fight now . '' And audience got a tantalizing tease from another figure from the past : Emperor Palpatine from the original and prequel trilogy , whose ominous laugh close out the promotional spot .
 Carrie Fisher 's Leia Organa is back a well , despite the actress 's untimely passing in Dec. 2016 , thanks to unused footage from `` The Force Awakens '' which Abrams wa able to craft into it own narrative for this new film .
 `` You ca n't just recast and you ca n't just have her disappear , '' Abrams said . `` The idea of having a CG character wa n't even an option . ''
 He 's currently in the process of editing and adding visual effect to the film which will hit theater on Dec. 20 and said that despite Fisher 's death , `` We 're working with her every day . ''
 `` Princess Leia life in this film in way that is mind-blowing to me , '' Abrams said .
 Abrams wa joined on stage at the event by Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy and actor and droids alike including Ridley , Oscar Isaac ( Poe ) , John Boyega ( Finn ) , Kelly Marie Tran ( Rose ) , Joonas Suotamo ( Chewbacca ) , newcomer Naomi Ackie , who play a character named Jannah , Anthony Daniels ( C-3PO ) and even Billy Dee Williams , who reprises his role a Lando Calrissian in the new film after decade away .
 `` How did I find Lando again ? '' Williams said . `` Lando never left me . ''
 `` Star Wars '' superfan Stephen Colbert moderated the panel , doing his best to get the tight-lipped cast and creator to reveal anything about the film . Although no one cracked under pressure , Abrams did reveal some previously known detail , like the fact that `` The Rise of Skywalker '' will pick up `` some time '' after the event of `` The Last Jedi . ''
 `` This is an adventure that the group go on together , '' he teased , although he would n't reveal whether or not that meant the group on stage or some other combination .
 `` This movie is about this new generation and what they 've inherited , the light and the dark , '' Abrams added . `` As they face this greatest evil , are they prepared ? ''
 Besides Hamill , another person who wa n't in attendance wa Kylo Ren actor Adam Driver . Ren is the son of Han Solo and Leia , making him and his mother the only known Skywalkers left .
 When prodded about what will happen with the complex relationship between Kylo and Rey , Ridley demurred , `` I guess the Kylo and Rey thing , we 'll have to see . ''
 She added : `` I think I can confirm there are no more semi-naked Kylos . '' That 's a reference to the scene of a shirtless Driver in `` The Last Jedi '' that surprised fan .
 Although fan are salivating for any morsel of information , the panelist stayed a vague a possible , and kept thing light-hearted debating question like `` who 's a better pilot : Poe or Han '' and even taking a break so that the audience could sing an unprompted Happy Birthday to Ridley , who turned 27 on Wednesday .
 Kennedy , quoting George Lucas , said however that `` Episode IX '' is indeed the third act of a three-act structure .
 But , predictably , there are still more question than answer when it come to `` The Rise of Skywalker , '' especially what will come after .
 The Lucasfilm and Disney collaboration ha proved to be a lucrative one since Disney purchased the company in 2012 for $ 4 billion . Disney 's first two `` Star Wars '' film , `` The Force Awakens '' and `` The Last Jedi '' and it spinoffs , `` Rogue One '' and `` Solo , '' have already grossed more than $ 4.8 billion at the worldwide box office .
 As of now , there is a future for `` Star Wars '' on the big screen , but detail are sparse and date are non-existent . `` The Last Jedi '' director Rian Johnson is working on a new `` Star Wars '' trilogy and `` Game of Thrones '' showrunners D.B . Weiss and David Benioff are also at work on a `` movie series . ''
 Lucasfilm is expanding it small screen universe too beyond `` The Clone Wars '' with the Jon Favreau-directed series `` The Mandalorian , '' which will be available on Disney 's streaming service , DisneyPlus , when it launch on Nov. 12 , and there will be a `` Rogue One '' spinoff series focused on Diego Luna 's character Cassian Andor . With the company 's acquisition of 21st Century Fox 's entertainment property , too , Lucas ' original trilogy and prequels will also be available on the service .
 But who 's got time to think about the future when there are over two minute of brand new footage from `` The Rise of Skywalker '' to dissect ?

 LOS ANGELES — While superheroes , monster and alien battle on the big screen , a real-life fight is raging behind the scene that will determine what moviegoer will see at their local cinema .
 The off-screen skirmish center around the theatrical `` window , '' the time a movie play exclusively in U.S. theater before it can be released on DVD or digital . That period average 90 day , but upheaval across the medium business is fueling debate on whether that should shrink .
 At stake is the future of movie theater and small-screen entertainment a new technology giant upend decade of Hollywood tradition .
 Netflix Inc ha streamed original movie at the same time , or just a few week after , their debut in cinema . Competitor Amazon Studios ha said it would like some of it film to play for only two to eight week in theater before hitting the Amazon Prime Video streaming service .
 Many theater owner object , citing potential damage to their business . The group that award the Oscars is weighing whether to respond , and A-list celebrity are taking side .
 Adam Aron , chief executive of AMC Entertainment Holdings , the world 's largest theater operator , said his company would `` consider any and all alternative '' but any change to the current industry standard `` would have to be beneficial to u or neutral to u . ''
 Even the king of the multiplex - Walt Disney Co - is getting into streaming , and is set to unveil detail on Thursday of it strategy . That ha stoked concern that it , too , might want movie in living room sooner .
 Disney executive insist they remain rock-solid behind existing window for big event film . Disney 's franchise fare such a `` Black Panther '' and `` Avengers : Infinity War '' generated a total $ 7.3 billion at global box office in 2018 .
 At a recent CinemaCon convention for theater owner in Las Vegas , Disney and other studio stressed the special experience of watching a film in a darkened theater .
 `` A lot more people have had their first kiss in a movie theater than their parent ' living room , '' said Toby Emmerich , a senior executive at Warner Bros. , part of AT & T Inc 's WarnerMedia , which also plan a streaming push .
 Oscar-winning actress Helen Mirren wa more forthright . `` I love Netflix , but fuck Netflix ! '' she said to cheer and applause . `` There 's nothing like sitting in the cinema and the light go down . ''
 Netflix is in talk to buy the Egyptian Theatre , a historic movie house in the heart of Hollywood , a source with knowledge of the matter said . Netflix would host premiere and other industry event at the theater , which opened in 1922 , the source said .
 Amazon Studios bos Jennifer Salke , meanwhile , declared the company `` committed to the theatrical experience . '' In June , it is slated to release comedy `` Late Night '' in theater , with a traditional window .
 Shorter window would keep some customer at home , said Greg Marcus , chief executive of The Marcus Corporation , owner of the fourth-largest U.S. theater chain .
 `` If you damage the business and take away 10 percent of our customer , we wo n't be able to reinvest in the theatrical experience , '' Marcus said . `` That would ultimately hurt content provider . ''
 Others said consumer are happy with the current system . Ticket sale in 2018 reached a record $ 41 billion globally and $ 12 billion in the United States and Canada , even a Netflix released about 90 movie for streaming .
 `` We 're not talking about something that 's broken , '' Vue International cinema CEO Tim Richards said in an interview .
 OSCAR SHOWDOWN
 `` Windowing '' is expected to be on the agenda this month at a meeting about rule governing the Academy Awards .
 Some member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences , the group that award the Oscars , have been debating whether film must play in theater for a specific length of time to be eligible .
 Director Steven Spielberg told Britain 's ITV News last year that movie seen primarily via streaming should compete for Emmys , not Oscars . A representative declined to comment on whether the director will urge the Academy to address the issue .
 In February , Netflix won three Oscars for `` Roma , '' which streamed three week after a limited theatrical debut . Netflix tweeted that it `` loved cinema '' but also supported access for people who can not afford , or do not live close to , theater .
 The Justice Department ha waded in , warning the Academy that some eligibility limit could be anti-competitive .
 An Academy spokesperson said any change would be weighed at the April 23 meeting .
 The issue could flare up later this year when Netflix release `` The Irishman , '' a mob drama directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino .
 Filmmakers hope `` The Irishman '' will play broadly in theater , De Niro said in an interview , though they realize Netflix 's chief audience is it streaming customer .
 `` They 're not going to cut their nose to spite their face , '' De Niro said . `` We get it . This kind of movie ha to be presented that way . ''
 But he added : `` We 're working it out so we can have a much theatrical a possible . ''

 If movie studio needed another reminder that audience are craving for new kind of superpowered hero , they got it this weekend .
 Disney ’ s “ Captain Marvel ” rode a wave of enthusiasm for more diverse superheroes , a hunger for blockbuster at a quiet time of year and a large helping of ’ 90 nostalgia to sell $ 153 million in ticket in U.S. theater over the weekend .
 It wa easily the best stateside debut weekend of any movie this year a it breezily outperformed expectation and brought the domestic box office a much-needed boost .
 The Brie Larson-led movie ’ s opening weekend wa the seventh best of any in the 21-film Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise , behind the $ 174.1 million brought in by “ Iron Man 3 ” and just ahead of “ Guardians of the Galaxy Vol . 2 , ” which made $ 146.5 million during it first weekend . ( Topping that list : “ Avengers : Infinity War , ” which took in $ 257.7 million when it debuted . )
 “ Captain Marvel ” is the first film in the franchise dedicated to the story of a female superhero . DC-Warner Bros. and their Gal Gadot-led “ Wonder Woman ” broke a comic book glass ceiling in 2017 , but “ Captain Marvel ” had an even stronger opening , bringing in over $ 50 million more than “ Wonder Woman , ” which sold around $ 100.5 million in ticket during it opening weekend . While DC-Warner Bros. hired a single woman — Patty Jenkins — to direct “ Wonder Woman , ” Disney-Marvel ’ s movie split directing duty between Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck , who wrote the script with Geneva Robertson-Dworet .
 An origin story whose soundtrack trade in the like of Salt-N-Pepa and Nirvana , “ Captain Marvel ” is set principally in 1990s California , where Larson ’ s hero crash-lands and eventually team up with Nicholas Fury , a government agent familiar to Marvel fan and here played by a younger-looking , digitally rejuvenated Samuel L. Jackson . Ben Mendelsohn , Jude Law , Annette Bening and Lashana Lynch play other major role .
 [ Read our critic ’ s review of “ Captain Marvel . ” ]
 “ Captain Marvel ” received fairly positive review — it currently hold an 80 % “ fresh ” rating on Rotten Tomatoes — but it critical reception hasn ’ t been a strong a some other high-grossing Disney-Marvel entry ( by comparison , “ The Avengers ” hold a 92 % “ fresh ” rating ; “ Captain America : Civil War ” hold 91 % ) . Whether the critic ’ response affect the new movie ’ s staying power remains to be seen , but it strong start is good news for Disney . The studio is also using “ Captain Marvel ” to drive up interest in “ Avengers : Endgame , ” the next entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that ’ s slated for release next month . That film will count Brie Larson ’ s newly-minted character among it ensemble of hero , alongside Chris Evans ’ s Captain America , Robert Downey Jr. ’ s Iron Man , Mark Ruffalo ’ s Hulk , Chadwick Boseman ’ s Black Panther and others in what is essentially the popcorn movie equivalent of a musical supergroup .
 Moviegoers who didn ’ t see “ Captain Marvel ” this weekend mostly picked between two other film . Universal ’ s “ How to Train Your Dragon : The Hidden World , ” now in it third weekend , brought in about $ 14.7 million . And Lionsgate ’ s “ A Madea Family Funeral , ” the swan song of Tyler Perry ’ s long-running title character , sold $ 12.1 million in ticket according to Comscore , which compiles box office data . Other than “ Captain Marvel , ” there were no first-week movie in the top ten .

 The game of throne at NBCUniversal ha begun .
 The company on Monday announced a series of executive change that could set the stage for the next generation of leader at a medium empire that includes the NBC broadcast network ; Universal Film Studios ; and cable channel such a Bravo and MSNBC , which ha seen a rating surge during the Trump administration .
 Stephen B. Burke , the chief executive , streamlined the management structure by putting Jeff Shell in charge of Hollywood operation , including the international business and Telemundo , and having Mark Lazarus oversee the broadcast network , the news division , the cable network and the sport group .
 Bonnie Hammer , 68 , the longtime head of the company ’ s profitable cable portfolio , ha been put in charge of an advertising-supported streaming service that wa announced Monday and is expected to debut early next year . It will compete with new stand-alone streaming product from the Walt Disney Company and AT & T ’ s WarnerMedia , a well a entrenched player like Netflix and Hulu . Disney ’ s and WarnerMedia ’ s product are expected to debut at the end of this year .
 Many in the industry interpreted the move a Mr. Burke ’ s positioning a showdown between Mr. Lazarus and Mr . Shell to be his possible successor . Effectively , Mr. Burke , 60 , ha set up an East Coast and West Coast divide : Mr. Lazarus will control much of the company from NBC ’ s operation in New York and Stamford , Conn. , and Mr . Shell will take over the Hollywood asset from Burbank , Calif .
 “ Mark and Jeff , I think , are two of the most capable people in the entertainment business , ” Mr. Burke said in an interview in his office at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in Manhattan . “ Everyone ha been very supportive of each other . It wa just time . ”
 As for what the move mean for Mr. Burke ’ s future , he added , “ I ’ m not going anywhere . ”
 Mr. Burke wa appointed the head of NBCUniversal in 2011 after Comcast completed it acquisition of the medium giant . At the time , over 20 executive reported directly to him . The latest change will bring that number down to 12 .
 “ We can move faster now , ” he said .
 Mr. Lazarus , 55 , ha been the head of NBC Sports since 2011 , when he replaced Dick Ebersol . He will now oversee NBC News , MSNBC and the moneymaking cable portfolio that includes Bravo , USA and the E ! network . Andrew Lack , the NBC News chairman , will report to Mr. Lazarus .
 Mr . Shell , 53 , will continue to oversee the film division and also have control of NBC Entertainment a well a the international division and Telemundo . The NBC Entertainment co-chairmen Paul Telegdy and George Cheeks , who replaced Robert Greenblatt in September , will report to Mr . Shell . Before coming to NBC Universal in 2013 , Mr . Shell wa an executive in Comcast ’ s programming group .
 The move to streaming will be a big one for Ms. Hammer , who joined Universal three decade ago . She ha overseen many of NBC ’ s profitable cable property for several year , and is one of the most powerful woman in television .
 Mr. Burke said that he had considered executive from outside the rank to run the streaming business , but that Ms. Hammer wa “ the right person . ”
 “ She didn ’ t hesitate , ” he added .
 She will be joined by two executive from Sky , the British pay-TV operator that Comcast won in a bidding war with Disney last year . Sky is primarily known a a satellite broadcaster , but it ha developed a robust streaming service that run across several European territory . NBCUniversal hope to take advantage of their experience .
 Jumping into streaming ha become the go-to strategy for established medium business . Disney bought most of Rupert Murdoch ’ s 21st Century Fox business with the idea that it would start selling show and film directly to consumer . AT & T bought Time Warner for the same purpose . As more people cut their cable subscription , streaming service are taking a share of that business .
 But NBCUniversal is taking a two-sided approach that aim to keep the cable business intact . The ad-supported product will be free to anyone who ha a cable or satellite account , but for cord cutter there will be a pay option .

 The attention of classical music in America on Thursday wa divided between the opposite coast . By coincidence , new piano concerto by two of the most important composer of our time had their premiere : Thomas Adès ’ s in Boston and John Adams ’ s in Los Angeles .
 [ Read more about the dueling premiere . ]
 There is a deep and rich tradition in the meeting between a solo pianist and a symphony orchestra . The result can be thunderous battle , delicate sympathy , genial play — sometimes all in the same piece .
 Mr. Adès , 48 , and Mr. Adams , 72 — both with strongly individual voice , both keenly aware of what ’ s come before — are ideally suited to take on this looming history , and to contribute to it . David Allen , on the East Coast , and Zachary Woolfe , in the West , heard the result .
 BOSTON — Mr. Adès ha written a piano concerto before , but not a Piano Concerto .
 Aside from a brief “ Concerto Conciso ” ( 1997 ) for piano and chamber ensemble , his main foray in the genre to this point ha been “ In Seven Days ” ( 2008 ) , a depiction of the Creation in seven movement , with optional video installation .
 His new and quite wonderful Concerto for Piano and Orchestra , which Kirill Gerstein played on Thursday with the composer leading the Boston Symphony Orchestra , is different . As Mr. Adès ha put it , it ’ s a “ proper piano concerto , ” along the line of Mozart or Bartok .
 It ha no title . It ha whistle-worthy theme . It ha three movement , fast-slow-fast , marked only by their tempo . It ha an opening in sonata form , with a first subject , a second subject , a development section , a recapitulation and a cadenza . It ha a poignant , melodic second movement . It ha a slithering , cascading finale , with a coda that end with a cadential sequence Beethoven might have been proud of .
 It ’ s refreshingly , even radically , normal .
 Surely it can ’ t be so ? Even if his style is relatively approachable , Thomas Adès still is Thomas Adès , the once-iconoclastic composer of mischievous , sardonic work like “ Powder Her Face ” ( 1995 ) , “ Totentanz ” ( 2013 ) and “ The Exterminating Angel ” ( 2016 ) .
 So you might expect me to point to some irony I heard running a caustic undercurrent , tugging the whole thing down . Perhaps Mr. Adès is actually dismantling the concerto from within ? Perhaps he ’ s offering a blistering , subversive take on what a frankly modern piano concerto can be , a he did more than 20 year ago for the symphony with “ Asyla ” ( 1997 ) ?
 If he is , I didn ’ t hear it .
 Instead , Mr. Adès ’ s 20-minute work come off a an affectionate , joyous , remarkably uncomplicated tribute to tradition . The writing is labyrinthine , to be sure , but this is a composer so sure of his ability and influence that there is no sense in this concerto of history a a burden or a something to be thrown off . It is , rather , something to be approached a an equal .
 And while plenty of composer talk about how they have thought about the tradition when they write a new concerto , few have placed themselves in it with such breathtaking ease a Mr. Adès doe here .
 As ever , the craft is astounding , the orchestration ceaselessly brilliant . The voice is wholly his own — dissonant , offbeat , whiplash , wry — even a it whisper to music past .
 Something of the angular , unnerving opening theme bear an uncanny resemblance to the upward , four-note motif that George Gershwin used for the word “ I got rhythm. ” Something about the slow movement , which pull at the heart with an open directness that ’ s unusual in this composer ’ s music , can be traced to the atmosphere of Beethoven ’ s Fourth Concerto , it powerful brass and wind chorale answered with placid wonder by the piano , at least at first .
 There ’ s a funny wink to hyper-Romantic excess when a glockenspiel tinkle above the fray at the end of the finale . The way a phrase will end , a mood shift , brings Rachmaninoff fluttering into mind . The technical demand are Lisztian and worse .
 Not that anything seems to daunt Mr. Gerstein , the pianist who asked for the new work while rehearsing “ In Seven Days ” in Boston seven year ago . He dispatched this concerto with his customary virtuosity and commitment , but for all his double-octave flash , it wa his tender voicing of the cluster chord that halo the melody of the slow movement that lingers in the ear . He played a if the concerto had been a friend for year .
 These two artist have struck quite the partnership ; they play piano duo at Zankel Hall on March 13 and bring the new concerto to Carnegie on March 20 . Also on the bill then will be the same piece performed here in Boston : Liszt ’ s “ Mephisto Waltz No . 1 , ” given a raunchy if not quite fluent reading , and a loud , bombastic , thrillingly crude take on Tchaikovsky ’ s Symphony No . 4 . Be there . DAVID ALLEN
 LOS ANGELES — After Yuja Wang had finished playing the premiere of Mr. Adams ’ s concerto at Walt Disney Concert Hall here , and the applause wouldn ’ t stop , she returned to the stage for an encore .
 She played a piece by — who else ? — John Adams . Dating back to 1977 , “ China Gates ” is one of his earliest work , a short solo that ’ s a calm , steady precipitation of eighth note : sometimes a smiling sunshower , sometimes a melancholy drizzle .
 Coming right after the new concerto , “ Must the Devil Have All the Good Tunes ? , ” it gave a moving summary of how far Mr. Adams ha come over 40 year , in musical complexity and emotional nuance . And also how much his preoccupation of those long-ago day — tension between rhythmic regularity and tremor of instability ; simultaneous propulsion and reflection — still interest him today .
 Given it premiere by Gustavo Dudamel and the Los Angeles Philharmonic , which will tour it widely , “ Must the Devil ” is an uneasy experience : restless — indeed , relentless — but uncertain , pensive even when it ’ s peppy . Written during a period in which Mr. Adams also made a new opera , “ Girls of the Golden West , ” about the dark side of the California Gold Rush , the concerto come across a a companion work .
 Another gloomy , even bitter , study in Americana , it most distinctive bit of orchestration is a part for honky-tonk piano ( ideally a detuned upright , but on Thursday conjured electronically , and far too weakly ) that evokes the saloon — and , implicitly , the chauvinistic illusion — of Hollywood western , while coming across a a devilish shadow of the “ real ” solo piano .
 In three part , played a a single movement of not quite half an hour , “ Must the Devil ” begin in a sudden surge and chug along industriously but with stumble — a machine that fails to find it groove . The music build in intricacy but remains oddly reticent , with unsettling snap and buzz ( “ gritty , funky , but in strict tempo , ” Mr. Adams indicates for this first section ) from the double bass and an electric bass , located on opposite side of the orchestra .
 Relaxing into the second part with a lulling motif for bassoon and string — you might think of Ravel — “ Must the Devil ” trouble the piano ’ s serenity with a sustained low tremble in the bass , and a disturbing plunk of honky-tonk . There ’ s early Adams ( and the process Minimalism that preceded him ) in the melodic thread forming in repeated fit and start , trying to emerge and complete itself . In passage , the soloist seems to be trying out a kind of rag , but while the rhythm ha a gentle , low-slung swing , the piano never find it footing .
 The orchestra gently egg the soloist on into the third section , inaugurated with frosty Adamsian fragment of trumpet fanfare . But there ’ s little sense of the triumph — or , at least , the reveling in extravagance and difficulty — of earlier finale by this composer . I found this conclusion much like the rest of the piece : anxious , fascinating , sad .
 The ending come all at once : The hubbub suddenly drop away , leaving a single toll of a bell . Has someone died ? Something ? A culture ? A country ?
 Ms. Wang wa an unfailing , cool to the touch , detailed soloist . Each note , even in a fast run , wa precisely considered : a slippery smooth note followed by a diamond-hard one . The almost ominously immaculate quality of her playing wa well suited to Mr. Adams ’ s dark fantasia , which offer virtuosity while staying — intentionally , I think — wary of it , and any , thrill . ( There ’ s tellingly no cadenza to speak of . )
 After intermission , Mr. Dudamel ’ s interpretation of Mahler ’ s First Symphony recalled aspect of “ Must the Devil ” : the off-kilter quality and troubled lyricism of the first movement , the ruefully swirling third . But , in it straightforward — even bland — healthy-mindedness , this Mahler more than anything acted a a kind of peace offering after Mr. Adams ’ s beautifully disconcerting concerto . ZACHARY WOOLFE

 Critic ’ s Notebook
 By Seth Colter Walls
 At the Juilliard School , the pianist Aaron Diehl studied both classical and jazz tradition . And in the year since , he ’ s chosen to follow each of those path — and sometimes both , simultaneously .
 Mr. Diehl ha played with Cécile McLorin Salvant and Wynton Marsalis . His own recording a a bandleader have revealed him to be not only a stylish improviser , but also a composer worth watching .
 In recent year , he ha revived the practice of interpreting Gershwin ’ s concert music through an improvisatory filter . His imaginative yet idiomatic turn in the Concerto in F with the New York Philharmonic at their opening-night gala in 2016 contained the hardest-swinging note I ’ ve ever heard inside David Geffen Hall . ( It wa an interpolated low D that Mr. Diehl tossed off with casually elegant force toward the end of the first movement . )
 This weekend , Mr. Diehl play “ Rhapsody in Blue ” ( on Saturday ) and the le familiar “ Second Rhapsody ” ( on Sunday ) with the Los Angeles Philharmonic a part of the brief but potent series “ William Grant Still and the Harlem Renaissance . ”
 “ The challenge is creating this balance between the improvisation and the written score , ” Mr. Diehl said of his approach to “ Rhapsody in Blue . ”
 Gershwin , in a way , is the exception this weekend : The rest of the Philharmonic ’ s programming put the spotlight on black composer . William Grant Still ’ s symphony serve a anchor of the program , the First on Saturday and the Fourth on Sunday .
 Symphonic arrangement of work by Duke Ellington also appear all weekend , and a new piece — Adolphus Hailstork ’ s “ Still Holding On ” — will have it premiere on Sunday . ( It ’ s one of the 50-plus commission the orchestra ha made a part of it centennial season . )
 An earlier orchestral miniature by Mr. Hailstork , “ Celebration , ” wa captured in the 1970s for Columbia Records ’ s Black Composers Series , a set which wa recently remastered and reissued . That recording wa the conductor Thomas Wilkins ’ s introduction to Mr. Hailstork ’ s music .
 “ I ’ ve always found him to be a great craftsman , ” said Mr. Wilkins , who will be conducting the Los Angeles concert . “ You hear his upbringing in his music ; you hear his culture in his music . But it ’ s not on the sleeve . ”
 “ It ’ s quite tonal , ” he added , “ but it ’ s not without chromaticism . And some of the time , because he ’ s sort of hinting at a blue lick or a jazz gesture , we find note that are bent or twisted . Or a jazz harmony all of a sudden. ” ( Two other piece by Mr. Hailstork will be performed by the Harlem Chamber Players on Feb. 28 at the New York Public Library ’ s Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture . )
 Mr. Wilkins said that he and the Philharmonic wanted to acknowledge Still ’ s earlier and better-known First Symphony — subtitled “ The Afro-American Symphony ” — but also push audience toward le familiar part of the composer ’ s body of work .
 “ He ’ s unapologetic about being a black person , ” said Mr. Wilkins . “ In the last movement of the First Symphony , he begin with this plaintive song in the entire orchestra , that eventually find it way to the cello section only — which I think is the instrument which sound most like the human voice . There is this ‘ Lord have mercy ’ kind of sound in that music . And then , of course , the allegro take over . It ’ s ‘ we have no choice but to go forward. ’ That ’ s what that music doe . ”
 In the Fourth Symphony , Mr. Wilkins identifies “ that same longing , that same aspirational sound world . But this symphony end not allegro , but profoundly — it ’ s like a pronouncement at the end . It ’ s grand , and the gesture are large and bold . And not lickety-split fast . It is it own kind of affirmation : ‘ Yes , this is who I am . ’ ”
 Asked what else they could imagine programming , were the Philharmonic ’ s short festival to be longer , Mr. Wilkins named William Dawson ’ s “ Negro Folk Symphony ” and “ more Hailstork . ”
 Mr. Diehl said he would be eager to tease out unexpected connection between different century : “ I would have Scarlatti on , maybe , the top half of the set . And then end with , like , Roscoe Mitchell . I just feel like good music is good music . Duke Ellington always said that . ”

 As “ Captain Marvel ” swooped into it second weekend in theater on Friday , the question wasn ’ t really whether it would top domestic ticket sale , but by how much .
 Disney-Marvel can breathe easy . Their latest superhero origin story , the first film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe dedicated to a female superhero , sold an estimated $ 69.3 million in ticket nationwide this weekend , bringing it North American total to around $ 266.2 million .
 That ’ s a higher figure than the lifetime domestic gross of “ Captain America : The Winter Soldier ” ( $ 259.8 million ) , and already make “ Captain Marvel ” the 13th-best-selling film in the current 21-movie Marvel series — with room to grow .
 “ Captain Marvel ” ha done well internationally , too , with $ 120 million in overseas sale this weekend , according to the studio , for a global total of $ 760 million . While the figure aren ’ t earth-shattering , they indicate a solid success for Disney-Marvel .
 [ Read our critic ’ s review of “ Captain Marvel . ” ]
 That success came despite attempt by troll to derail “ Captain Marvel. ” Ahead of it release , the film wa the target of effort at online sabotage by user apparently lashing out against it star , Brie Larson , who ha been outspoken in her support of more diverse representation in Hollywood movie . The campaign prompted the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes to make major change to it longstanding rule , including the elimination of audience review for movie that have not yet been released .
 Free from any targeted online attack wa Paramount ’ s “ Wonder Park , ” an animated family movie about a young girl who dream up plan for an amusement park and see them colorfully brought to life . That movie sold $ 16 million in ticket domestically this weekend , according to Comscore , which compiles box-office data . While a far cry from “ Captain Marvel , ” the figure wa more than enough to land “ Wonder Park ” in second place .
 The only other newcomer in the top five wa Lionsgate and CBS Films ’ s “ Five Feet Apart , ” in third . The movie , about a couple whose shared genetic disorder force them to maintain physical distance from each other despite their growing romance , sold $ 13.2 million in ticket .
 An earlier version of this article omitted the name of a distributor of “ Five Feet Apart. ” The movie is distributed by Lionsgate and CBS Films , not just Lionsgate .

 LOS ANGELES — For a certain set of collector , opening a private museum ha become de rigueur . But Dean Valentine started a small art fair instead , with an eye to giving everyone a chance to discover new talent the way he doe .
 The fair , called Felix , wa founded with the local art-dealing brother Al and Mills Morán . It drew 40 dealer who offered their ware in a series of room and cabana at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel ( it wa held Feb. 14-17 , timed to be concurrent with the first edition of the Frieze Los Angeles fair ) .
 “ I learned a lot of what I know about art from hanging out with dealer in the mid-90s and asking them , ‘ Why is this any good ? ’ ” said Mr. Valentine , the former president of Walt Disney Television and the former chief executive officer of UPN .
 Mr. Valentine ’ s own room — in the rambling Hollywood Georgian-style home he share with his wife , Amy Adelson , and their two child — display some of the recent fruit of 25 year of contemporary collecting .
 Most of the work were made in the last few year , like Joyce Pensato ’ s painting “ Iceman Batman ” ( 2016 ) and Sanya Kantarovsky ’ s oil “ Lavender Arrest ” ( 2015 ) . Exceptions are a 1996 version of Andrea Zittel ’ s customized “ A-Z Escape Vehicles , ” a small metal trailer , and a couple of painted Greek vas dating to 500 B.C . that he bought at Sotheby ’ s .
 “ I respond to complexity , ” Mr. Valentine said . But he also enjoys provocation : The master bedroom feature a fanciful full-length Kurt Kauper painting of Cary Grant , nude , complete with tan line , and standing by a roaring fire .
 Ms. Adelson , a film and TV producer , let her husband field the collecting duty . “ He ’ s broken me down , ” she said , smiling .
 The couple ha given away more than 600 artwork over the year , to the Whitney Museum of American Art , the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles and the Hammer Museum , among others .
 “ I ’ ve always thought it ’ d be really nice that , when I ’ m gone , my kid will be wandering through a museum and they ’ ll see , ‘ The gift of Dean Valentine and Amy Adelson , ’ ” he said . “ I think that ’ ll be meaningful to them . ”
 The day after Felix opened , the couple talked about the origin of their collection . Here are edited excerpt from the conversation .
 How did this get started ?
 DEAN VALENTINE It wa 1994 , before my father died . At one point he wa at New York ’ s Sloan Kettering , and I wa visiting him a lot . And at the time I wa running Disney Television , and there ’ s that gap of a few hour where New York is up and buzzing , but everybody in L.A. is still having breakfast . So I ’ d walk around New York , and one day I wandered into an art gallery .
 What did you find ?
 VALENTINE Works by Yuri Kuper , who did these beautiful , Cy Twombly-esque thing on thing on blackboard . For whatever reason , they spoke to me . That wa the first acquisition .
 Did your emotional state affect the purchase ?
 VALENTINE It changed my relationship to art , that it wasn ’ t this decorative thing , it wa something that conveyed emotion and feeling . From what I have read , a mortality event almost always lie at the core of some collection mania . It certainly wa in my case .
 AMY ADELSON I will say , I have a vivid memory of one of the first piece he brought home , on approval : A piece from Mihail Chemiakin ’ s Angels of Death series .
 A bit dark ?
 ADELSON I said to him , ‘ I know you are coping with issue of mortality right now and you ’ re mourning the imminent loss of your father , but this is going to be really hard to live with . [ Laughs ] Do we have to manifest your mourning through this ? ’ We didn ’ t keep it .
 Dean , did working for Disney inform your collecting at all ?
 VALENTINE I ran the Walt Disney network animation for a number of year , which wa my favorite job there . And I love animation ; I think I ’ m just inherently drawn to it since childhood . And being around animator and hanging out with artist , I think it deepened my connection to art .
 So it wasn ’ t about Hollywood creativity generally ?
 VALENTINE Otherwise , no . I think everybody always assumes there ’ s this inherent connection between Hollywood and art collecting . And the truth is , most people here don ’ t collect . They don ’ t know anything about art ; they don ’ t have any inclination for it .

 LOS ANGELES — Warner Bros. ha finally earned back the benefit of the doubt when it come to it all-important superhero movie : “ Shazam ! ” became the studio ’ s third nonsequel comic-book hit in a row over the weekend , arriving to applause from critic and stout ticket sale of nearly $ 156 million worldwide .
 “ We really want these movie to stand on their own , with filmmaker best suited to the character , ” Toby Emmerich , chairman of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group , said by phone on Sunday morning . “ We ’ re all feeling deservedly really good . ”
 “ Shazam ! ” wa the No . 1 movie in North America , collecting $ 53.5 million over the weekend , according to Comscore , which compiles box-office data . Paid preview in partnership with Fandango in late March , designed to prompt positive chatter online , added $ 3.33 million . “ Shazam ! ” also had a solid start in country like Mexico and Russia .
 [ Read our critic ’ s take on “ Shazam ! ” ]
 Second place at the domestic box office went to a remake of “ Pet Sematary ” ( Paramount ) , based on the novel by Stephen King . It took in an estimated $ 25 million . Disney ’ s big-budget “ Dumbo ” trundled along in third place , selling $ 18.2 million in ticket , for a sad two-week total of $ 76.3 million .
 “ Shazam ! ” wa made by New Line , a division of Warner that focus on lower-cost film that often serve a counterprogramming . Made for about $ 100 million — about 40 percent le than most superhero movie — “ Shazam ! ” tell the story of a teenage boy ( played by Asher Angel , known for Disney Channel ’ s “ Andi Mack ” ) who can turn himself into a hero with an adult body ( Zachary Levi ) and unique power .
 “ New Line always thought that ‘ Big ’ a a superhero movie wa a great idea , a way to make the genre feel fresh and different , ” Emmerich said .
 Warner ha spent the better part of a decade trying to get it act together with movie based on character from it DC Comics division — an imperative given the runaway success of rival Marvel Studios and the film industry ’ s increasing need for spectacle that audience see a worth a trip to theater . Part of the problem wa that Warner stuck for too long with a dark vision for it superhero universe , set by the filmmaker Zack Snyder , that wa clearly not working . That led to creative and financial mess like “ Suicide Squad ” and “ Justice League . ”
 But the studio , having largely jettisoned Snyder ’ s plan and shaken up it executive rank , including promoting Emmerich , ha started to deliver superhero home run on a consistent basis : “ Wonder Woman ” from Patty Jenkins , “ Aquaman ” from James Wan , and seemingly “ Shazam ! , ” which wa directed by a relative newcomer , David F. Sandberg .
 Where the PG-13 “ Shazam ! ” will end up at the box office remains a bit of a question mark given the impending arrival of “ Avengers : Endgame. ” Ticket buyer gave “ Shazam ! ” an A grade in CinemaScore exit poll , an indication of staying power .

 Nearly 42 year after the release of the original “ Star Wars , ” audience got their first look on Friday at the ninth chapter in this blockbuster science-fiction saga , set long ago in a galaxy far , far away .
 “ Star Wars : The Rise of Skywalker , ” whose title and teaser trailer were released at the Star Wars Celebration convention in Chicago , close out a new trilogy of film that started in 2015 . The first in that series , “ Star Wars : Episode VII — The Force Awakens , ” directed by J.J. Abrams , reconnected viewer with venerable hero like Han Solo ( Harrison Ford ) and Leia Organa ( Carrie Fisher ) while also introducing new character like the mysterious scavenger Rey ( Daisy Ridley ) , the renegade storm trooper Finn ( John Boyega ) and the villainous Kylo Ren ( Adam Driver ) .
 A 2017 sequel , “ Star Wars : The Last Jedi , ” directed by Rian Johnson , caught u up on the fate of the hero Luke Skywalker ( Mark Hamill ) , who had been largely absent from “ The Force Awakens . ”
 The new teaser trailer for the next installment , for which Abrams returned to the helm , begin with a tantalizing glimpse of Rey , alone on a desert planet and wielding her light saber a a mysterious starcraft charge at her . ( Can we presume it is piloted by Kylo Ren , her sometime ally and more frequent foe ? ) The voice of Luke Skywalker is heard to say : “ We ’ ve passed on all we know . A thousand generation live in you now . But this is your fight . ”
 There are all-too-brief look at character new and old , including Billy Dee Williams a the interstellar cad Lando Calrissian and Carrie Fisher , who died in 2016 , a Leia , using footage shot for “ The Force Awakens. ” A piece of onscreen text vow : “ The saga come to an end . ”
 And then there is a mysterious , villainous laugh , coming from an unseen figure . ( Disney confirmed on Friday that this wa indeed the cackle of the actor Ian McDiarmid , who will reprise his “ Star Wars ” role a the nefarious Palpatine in this new movie . )
 The new film is scheduled for release on Dec. 20 .
 This is at least the third time fan have been promised closure to the long-running narrative of the Skywalker clan : Everything looked well and fine at the end of George Lucas ’ s “ Return of the Jedi ” in 1983 , which wrapped up the classic original “ Star Wars ” trilogy . Then Lucas had to go and make a second trilogy of not especially beloved prequel film , telling the story of Anakin Skywalker ’ s metamorphosis into the sinister Darth Vader , which concluded in 2005 with “ Star Wars : Episode III — Revenge of the Sith . ”
 But that bargain wa altered after Disney acquired Lucasfilm and it “ Star Wars ” franchise in 2012 , leading to the new trilogy and stand-alone movie like “ Rogue One ” and “ Solo. ” At present , people like Johnson , a well a David Benioff and D.B . Weiss ( the showrunners of “ Game of Thrones ” ) , are developing their own “ Star Wars ” movie that will chronicle new character and plot line .
 So you can expect the larger , post-Skywalker franchise to continue until the heat death of the universe . As Luke say near the end of the teaser trailer , “ No one ’ s ever really gone . ”

 More parent are stripping nursery of all gender cue , to create space where child can develop their own identity .
 By Michael Tortorello
 Elliot Claire : What kind of baby name is that ? A girl ’ s name ? A boy ’ s name ? Both ?
 Mission accomplished , said Elizabeth and Sean Scotten , of Oakland , Calif. , who became parent to Elliot Claire almost a year ago . “ We loved the juxtaposition of a name that ’ s more traditionally masculine and a name that ’ s more feminine , ” Ms. Scotten , 35 , explained . As the baby grows up ( it ’ s a girl ! ) , she can use any combination of the two .
 “ My husband went through the experience of having to change his name , ” Ms. Scotten said . The couple started out a high school sweetheart , at age 14 . “ When we first met , he wa living a a girl . He wa my first girlfriend , and that ’ s changed . ”
 As for the nursery , the Scottens wrestled with a design question encountered by a generation of new parent , who , survey suggest , hold more accepting view of gender nonconformity . How to create a room where a baby can grow up to become a boy , a girl or whatever feel right ?
 Kerry Hegg , the head of product development for Crate and Kids , heard some of these preference in parent focus group the company hosted last summer . Mothers expressed a desire for beautiful , inspired product . They wanted to make room where child could express their personality . However , “ they may not want to assign a specific gender or force a gender , ” Ms. Hegg said .
 This wa a change from 10 year ago , or even five , Ms. Hegg added . Then , the baby aisle strenuously separated product by gender — often to mystifying effect . If cat are for girl , why are big cat — lion and tiger — for boy ? What ’ s inherently masculine about an astronaut in a spacesuit ?
 The Scottens chose a design scheme that felt true to their family value . Ms. Scotten is a middle school English teacher ; Mr. Scotten , a writer . The nursery theme they came up with ? Books .
 Stories teach empathy , Ms. Scotten said , a character encounter new people and place . “ It ’ s the anti-gender binary , to be immersed in seeing the world with a lot of different possibility through story . ”
 The Scottens picked image from some of their favorite childhood classic : “ The Velveteen Rabbit , ” “ The Paper Bag Princess , ” “ The Giving Tree , ” “ Old Possum ’ s Book of Practical Cats. ” Next , they scanned the illustration , blew them up on thick card stock , and arranged the art on the wall .
 Not every old book fit their value system , Ms. Scotten said — or the muted , modernist color scheme that matched the room ’ s Craigslist crib and hand-me-down rug . “ I wa like , ‘ Poky Little Puppy , ’ you can ’ t join u on our wall . ’ ”
 They ’ re baby , doubter will say . A newborn doesn ’ t infer anything from the fire truck pattern on the crib bumper .
 Here , the doubter would be wrong , or so a body of research suggests . Children don ’ t begin to categorize their gender until the age of 2 or 3 , explained Harriet Tenenbaum , who study gender identity at the University of Surrey in England . At that age , “ it ’ s a real incipient understanding , ” based on vague trait like hair length and height . ( “ They don ’ t have a great understanding of genitalia , ” Dr. Tenenbaum added . )
 But young child pick up cue from the toy they ’ re given , the word they hear , the book they read and the behavior they encounter on the playground .
 Dr. Tenenbaum pointed to a 2008 study that dealt with child ’ s room , in the behavioral science journal Sex Roles . The researcher showed photo of young child ’ s bedroom to untrained college student and asked them to guess the child ’ s gender . The participant succeeded more than 90 percent of the time .
 A parallel interview process revealed that parent who held more conservative gender view ( say , disapproving of a boy wearing nail polish ) also created the bedroom that appeared more traditionally male or female .
 Finally , researcher discovered , the child who lived in these kind of bedroom expressed more traditional view of gender in their own interview .
 Stripping the space of anything gendered is a poor solution , say Suzanne Tick , who ha written about gender identity in design and who creates textile and floor covering at her New York firm , Tick Studio . A better strategy involves filling the room with material and toy that encourage engagement and play .
 Practically , she said , that mean “ activating a room with bold shape and bold color and a mix of color . Soft tent , soft place where one can crawl into . Multiple area of exploration. ” She would encourage parent to decorate the room with book , plant , terrarium , ant farm , fishbowl .
 An-Lon Chen , 42 , can see her 3-year-old daughter , Nora , piecing together the rule and ritual of gender with her playmate in Seattle . Nora “ misgenders ” a beloved stuffed toy , “ clearly intended to be a girl doll. ” One day the doll will be “ he , ” the next day , “ she . ”
 What interest Ms. Chen about this habit is that it mimic her own parent , Chinese immigrant whose easy fluency in English wobble around gendered pronoun . Ms. Chen recall that her father conducted his own parenting experiment . He gave her a name , An-Lon , that sounded gender neutral in English and male in Mandarin . And he raised her in the same demanding style a her brother . Not unisex , but essentially male .
 The treatment felt disorienting : Her unstylish clothing didn ’ t match the way she felt inside . As a parent designing her own girl ’ s space , Ms. Chen set a different course . She tapped into the professional-grade empathy she ’ s acquired a a software engineer specializing in user interface design .
 The family ’ s modern three-bedroom home feel upside-down . The kitchen , living room and playroom stack above the bedroom and nursery . How could she make this 3D maze navigable for a clumsy toddler ?
 “ For me , the empowerment is more important , I guess , than the surface detail , ” she said . With YouTube a a guide ( and Home Depot a a supplier ) , Ms. Chen built a series of oak handrail , bridging one level of the home to the other . Height : About 20 inch off the ground .
 A fleet of step stool give Nora access to counter and shelf . And in the bathroom , a secondary rack for toilet-paper roll stand within a toddler ’ s arm length .
 Boy or girl , no one like to fall off the potty .
 For Ms. Chen , gender nonbinary nursery design mean understanding that a child foremost want to master her environment , and tool like step stool , faucet adapter , and railing encourage that development .
 This is a universal principle , she said . An independent child can express her gender in this realm when and how she chooses . “ All these meaningless choice parent make — worrying that a pink hippopotamus is too girlie — fritter away design energy that could be going somewhere more interesting , ” she said .
 When Kirsten McDonald , 29 , began to create a nursery in Plano , Tex. , she looked to her own visionary : Walt E. Disney . Wait : Does she mean the avuncular animator whose company more or le invented the American princess ?
 “ I love ‘ Beauty and the Beast ’ a much a the next girl , ” Ms. McDonald explained . “ But that ’ s not where my love of Disney come from. ” Growing up in small town across what she described a the “ Southern Bible Belt , ” she experienced the Disney theme park a a giddy , cosmopolitan haven . “ One guy had a vision of a place where people could have fun together , ” she said .
 By the time she became pregnant , Ms. McDonald worked for a hedge fund and traveled in le playful social circle . But she and her husband decided not to learn the sex of the baby until birth .
 How to keep the pink and blue junk ( and the gender bias they represent ) out of the house ? “ The only way to do it would be not to give anyone any option , ” she said .
 In the meantime , she began to assemble her Disney nursery . She landed on the vivid color and midcentury-modern geometry of the artist Mary Blair , who developed concept art for the Disney movie “ Alice in Wonderland ” and “ Peter Pan. ” Her best-known design work went into the theme park ’ s famous ride “ It ’ s a Small World . ”
 “ I figured bright color would be easy to find for a baby , but they weren ’ t at all , ” Ms. McDonald said . “ Everything is pastel. ” She bought an off-trend area rug from Overstock.com . And she custom-ordered a blanket and crib skirt from Etsy . A favorite aunt took an old family dresser and painted it with colorful pennant .
 When the baby wa born two year ago , the McDonalds blasted out the first round of photo without specifying a gender . The name , finally , gave it away : Eli McDonald , after Elias — the “ E ” in Walt E. Disney .

 Sidney Sheinberg , an irascible Universal Studios executive who discovered and nurtured Steven Spielberg , putting “ Jaws ” into production and helping to turn Hollywood into a blockbuster-focused business , died on Thursday at his home in Beverly Hills , Calif . He wa 84 .
 His death , following year of Parkinson ’ s disease , wa confirmed by his son , Jonathan .
 Mr. Sheinberg wa for much of his career the forthright top deputy to Lew Wasserman , the chairman of MCA , a conglomerate that encompassed Universal . The ultimate mogul , Mr. Wasserman defined power in Hollywood in the decade after World War II .
 But Mr. Sheinberg , openly intimidating a president and chief operating officer , kept the gear turning . When the two men left MCA in 1995 , Mr. Sheinberg had worked for the company for 36 year , the last 22 a president .
 During that time he helped transform Universal into an international entertainment giant , complete with a sprawling theme park empire .
 He played a major role in pivotal film like “ Back to the Future , ” in 1985 ( and a few hall-of-fame flop , like “ Waterworld ” 10 year later ) , and turned Universal into a television superpower . The company had the No . 1 show in 1970 with “ Marcus Welby , M.D. , ” about a kindhearted physician starring Robert Young , and churned out 20 movie-of-the-week project annually .
 Mr. Sheinberg wa also credited with seeing opportunity in music — he led MCA ’ s purchase of Motown in 1988 and Geffen Records in 1990 — and putting Universal into a competitive position with Disney in the global theme park business .
 Mr. Sheinberg relished a court battle , sparring about copyright issue with Sony over the VCR and with Nintendo over it Donkey Kong game .
 “ Sheinberg dealt with all people like a battering ram : Do it his way or get out of the way , ” Dennis McDougal wrote in the 1998 biography “ The Last Mogul : Lew Wasserman , MCA , and the Hidden History of Hollywood . ”
 Most important , Mr. Sheinberg discovered Mr. Spielberg . It wa 1968 and the director , in his early 20 , had just completed a short film , “ Amblin ’ , ” a love story about hitchhiking hippy . Based on what he saw , Mr. Sheinberg put Mr. Spielberg under contract and gave him a job directing television show . An episode of “ Marcus Welby ” wa one of the first . In 1971 came “ Duel , ” Mr. Spielberg ’ s thrilling TV movie about a commuter terrorized by a truck driver .
 With a line that ha come to epitomize loyalty in the often fickle movie business , Mr. Sheinberg told his protégé at the time : “ A lot of people will stick with you in success . I ’ ll stick with you in failure . ”
 Mr. Sheinberg , who could be a tender a he wa prickly , wa the one who allowed Mr. Spielberg to make “ Jaws , ” giving him a budget of $ 3.5 million ( about $ 17 million in today ’ s money ) . A problem-plagued shoot pushed the cost to more than twice a much .
 But Mr. Sheinberg , developing a father-son relationship with Mr. Spielberg , continued to support the film , which went on to become the prototype for the wide-release summer blockbuster .
 “ Sid created me , in a way , and I also re-created Sid , in a way , ” Mr. Spielberg wa quoted a saying in The New York Times in 1997 .
 Under Mr. Sheinberg ’ s watch , Universal released two more hit from Mr. Spielberg , “ E.T . the Extra-Terrestrial ” ( 1982 ) and “ Jurassic Park ” ( 1993 ) . It wa Mr. Sheinberg who handed Mr. Spielberg Thomas Keneally ’ s novel “ Schindler ’ s List , ” which the director turned into his masterpiece of the same title . Released in 1993 , it won seven Academy Awards , including best picture .
 “ My heart is broken , ” Mr. Spielberg said in a statement on Friday . “ For now , let me just say that Sid had a big personality and a tender heart . He wa the tallest , most stand-up guy I ever knew . ”
 Sidney Jay Sheinberg wa born on Jan. 14 , 1935 , in Corpus Christi , Tex. , to Harry and Tillie ( Grossman ) Sheinberg , Jewish immigrant from Eastern Europe . They ran a dry good store that catered mostly to Mexican-Americans .
 As a teenager , Mr. Sheinberg worked a an announcer and occasional disc jockey at a local radio station . He graduated from Columbia University in 1955 and enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin for law school .
 But he later transferred back to Columbia to earn his law degree after a dispute with Texas administrator over their treatment of black student . It wa a demonstration of his concern for discrimination that would lead him to become involved with Human Rights Watch and prompt him to push Hollywood studio to provide same-sex benefit , landing him on the cover of the gay magazine The Advocate in 1991 .
 “ I sat in his office a he made those phone call , and it wa not a quick ‘ Yes , yes , yes ’ from everyone ” at those studio , said Skip Paul , a senior adviser at the investment bank Centerview Partners , who wa groomed by Mr. Sheinberg at MCA . “ When Sid believed in something or somebody , he didn ’ t just have your back — he pushed on your back . ”
 In 1956 Mr. Sheinberg married a Columbia classmate , Lorraine Gary . They settled in Southern California , where she had grown up and would become an actress , starring in “ Jaws ” and it sequel . He accepted a teaching job at the University of California , Los Angeles in 1958 . The next year , he joined the legal department at Revue Productions , a television subsidiary of MCA , which eventually became Universal Television .
 As he rose in MCA ’ s television business , Mr. Sheinberg drew the attention of Mr. Wasserman . Though not similar in style — Mr. Wasserman wa smooth and diplomatic , while Mr. Sheinberg had rough edge — the men bonded over their background : They were both son of family who had fled Eastern Europe ’ s anti-Semitism and settled in Middle America . ( Mr. Wasserman , who died in 2002 , grew up in Ohio . )
 “ Lew took note of Sid because he wa one of the very few people who would stand up to him , ” the director and actor Jerry Adler said in “ The Last Mogul . ”
 Mr. Sheinberg ’ s brashness sometimes brought him into conflict with filmmaker . A fight with Terry Gilliam over the final cut of “ Brazil ” ( 1985 ) wa particularly dramatic , involving warring ad in Variety . Mr. Sheinberg also pushed Robert Zemeckis , unsuccessfully , to change the title of “ Back to the Future ” to “ Space Man From Pluto , ” a name that “ ha heat , originality and project fun , ” Mr. Sheinberg wrote in a memo to Mr. Zemeckis in 1984 . Mr. Zemeckis wa mortified .
 Mr. Spielberg stepped in , firing back a missive of his own on his fellow filmmaker ’ s behalf : “ Thanks for your most humorous memo . We all got a big laugh out of it . Keep ’ em coming . ”
 After he left MCA — having helped orchestrate the company ’ s sale to the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company in 1990 for more than $ 6 billion — Mr. Sheinberg , with his son , Jon and Bill , started a Universal-based production company called the Bubble Factory . The name came from a moment when Mr. Sheinberg wa in his backyard blowing bubble with his grandchild .
 The venture wa a disaster . The company made only a handful of movie , and most were bomb , including “ McHale ’ s Navy ” ( 1997 ) .
 Mr. Sheinberg ’ s survivor include his wife and son and a sister , Alice Schenk .
 In his time a MCA president , Mr. Sheinberg ’ s competitive streak wa never more pronounced than when it came to Disney , and it sometimes revealed a biting sense of humor .
 When he opened the first Universal theme park in Orlando , Fla. , in 1990 — in a race against Disney , which wa building a movie-themed park that is now called Disney ’ s Hollywood Studios — Mr. Sheinberg and his team incorporated one of Disney ’ s mouse-ear hat into the “ Jaws ” ride .
 The ear bobbed in the bloody water .

 ALBANY — A millionaire walk into the State Capitol and say , “ Raise my tax . ”
 Please .
 This wa no joke : The millionaire wa Morris Pearl , a former BlackRock executive who is the chairman of Patriotic Millionaires , a group dedicated to pushing for higher tax on business and the ultrarich .
 Testifying on Tuesday at a state budget hearing , Mr. Pearl asked a bipartisan group of about half a dozen legislator to create a new “ multimillionaire ’ s tax ” on household earning more than $ 5 million a year in order to fund new affordable housing , infrastructure and school .
 “ I ’ m a person of some mean . I could live wherever I want , ” said Mr. Pearl , a former managing director at BlackRock . “ I could live in Kansas , if I wanted to live in a state with low tax and low service . But I don ’ t . ”
 Of the more than 200 member in the Patriotic Millionaires , 41 live in New York , a state known for it high wealth and high tax . Their message arrives at a decisive moment : Democrats control the State Legislature and the governor ’ s mansion for the first time in a decade , and the ascendant progressive wing of the party is increasingly clamoring to narrow the income inequality gap , both in New York and nationwide .
 Several Democratic state legislator , a well a the City Council speaker , Corey Johnson , last week threw their support behind a so-called pied-à-terre tax , on wealthy people ’ s pricey secondary home , after a hedge fund billionaire bought a $ 238 million penthouse on Central Park . Senator Julia Salazar of Brooklyn wa elected in November a the Legislature ’ s first democratic socialist .
 Nationally , Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez recently popularized the idea of taxing income above $ 10 million at 70 percent . And Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is running for president on a promise to fight income inequality , with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont , a self-declared democratic socialist , considered a possible candidate a well .
 [ Some ultrarich believe the Trump tax cut unfairly benefit them , and are pushing for change . Read more here . ]
 At the same time , lawmaker here have rejected the new proposal to tax the ultrawealthy . Gov . Andrew M. Cuomo in particular ha spent the past week loudly disdaining the idea of an expanded millionaire ’ s tax , even a he ha projected a state budget shortfall of $ 2 billion .
 The wealthiest 1 percent of New Yorkers control about 31 percent of the state ’ s income , according to data from the Economic Policy Institute , a Washington-based think tank . They also account for half of the state ’ s income tax , according to Mr. Cuomo .
 “ There is a tipping point where people say , ‘ I love New York , but to spend another $ 300,000 in tax , I ’ ll move to Florida , ’ ” the governor , a Democrat , said in a radio interview last week . “ You know , tax the rich , tax the rich , tax the rich . Most progressive tax code , proud of it . But now look at how fragile your economy is . ”
 The State Senate ’ s Democratic majority leader , Andrea Stewart-Cousins , of Westchester , ha also dismissed the idea of new tax .
 Of course , progressive activist have argued for year that higher tax on the rich would not hurt the state ’ s economy . But the Patriotic Millionaires ’ hope — and that of the grass-roots group aligned with them — wa that the message would have more weight coming from , well , the rich .
 “ New York will always be New York . There ’ s no other place like it , and millionaire are concentrated here because of that , ” said Abigail Disney , the great-niece of Walt Disney and a member of the Patriotic Millionaires .
 The state ’ s current tax on high earner , which wa branded a a millionaire ’ s tax but affected people earning more than $ 300,000 , wa introduced in 2009 .
 Between then and 2016 , the number of millionaire filing tax in New York increased by 72 percent , with those millionaire ’ total income increasing by 54 percent in that time , according to the Fiscal Policy Institute , a union-backed nonpartisan think tank . Non-millionaires ’ income increased by 33 percent in the same period .
 “ The tax we ’ re talking about will not affect people ’ s quality of life , ” said Ms. Disney , who life in New York City . She did not travel to Albany but ha been active in the Patriotic Millionaires for year . “ They will not have any fewer private airplane or boat because of this tax . ”
 ( She added that fewer private plane would not harm anyone . Her family had once owned one , she said , and it made her “ le good at being able to stand in line and le able to tolerate being in a room with other people . ” )
 The coalition also includes investment banker , a psychologist , a home furnishing mogul and Friedrike Merck , an heir to the Merck pharmaceutical empire .
 Mr. Pearl said he had not met with Mr. Cuomo but had left several voice mail message for the governor ’ s counsel , Alphonso David . He also said he had met with Ms. Stewart-Cousins and the Democratic Assembly speaker , Carl E. Heastie , though not recently .
 In addition to creating a new multimillionaires ’ tax , which the group said could raise $ 3 billion each year , the Patriotic Millionaires also want to close the carried interest loophole , which allows hedge fund manager to pay a much lower federal tax rate on much of their income .
 Ms. Disney and Mr. Pearl said they also would support a pied-à-terre tax on property such a the $ 238 million Central Park penthouse bought by Kenneth C. Griffin , though the group ha not taken an official stance .
 “ If people like Mr. Griffin , who bought a $ 200 million-dollar-plus apartment in Manhattan , paid more tax , some of these million of dollar could do a lot for the school upstate , ” Mr. Pearl told lawmaker .
 Mr. Cuomo ha backed closing the carried interest loophole , and his aide said he would consider a pied-à-terre tax . But he ha openly mocked call for an expanded millionaire ’ s tax — especially in light of new federal tax law that Republicans passed in 2017 . According to Mr. Cuomo , those change fell hardest upon New York ’ s highest earner .
 Neither Ms. Disney nor Mr. Pearl denied that the federal tax change had cost them more — but in part , they said , because they did not actually know if that wa the case .
 “ To tell you the truth , I ’ m not sure exactly , ” said Mr. Pearl , adding that most of his income wa earned through capital gain , which are taxed at lower rate than normal income .
 “ I pay so much lower tax than people who work for a living anyway , ” he continued , “ that I ’ m not overly worried about it . ”

 LOS ANGELES — John Lasseter , the Pixar co-founder who wa forced to resign from the Walt Disney Company in June after complaint about unwanted touching in the workplace , ha become one of the first men toppled in the # MeToo era to find a new Hollywood perch .
 David Ellison , a “ Mission : Impossible ” producer and founder of Skydance Media , a production company affiliated with Paramount Pictures , said on Wednesday that Mr. Lasseter would become Skydance ’ s animation chief . Mr. Lasseter , 61 , will start this month at the company , which Mr. Ellison , 36 , started in 2010 with money inherited from his father , the Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison .
 The comedian Louis C.K . ha pushed to revive his comedy career — to vigorous opposition — after admitting to sexual misconduct . But Mr. Lasseter , a force behind the “ Toy Story , ” “ Cars ” and “ Frozen ” franchise , is one of the first executive in the entertainment industry to return to a position of prominence after # MeToo allegation .
 In giving Mr. Lasseter a comeback opportunity , Mr. Ellison appears to have weighed his own professional ambition — to build a major entertainment company — against any potential blowback , including from employee and advocacy organization like Time ’ s Up .
 “ John is a singular creative and executive talent whose impact on the animation industry can not be overstated , ” Mr. Ellison said in a statement . Skydance want “ to expand our animation effort for the global marketplace , ” he added . “ We look forward to John bringing all of his creative talent , his experience managing large franchise , his renewed understanding of the responsibility of leadership and his exuberance to Skydance . ”
 Still , Mr. Ellison continued : “ We did not enter into this decision lightly . John ha acknowledged and apologized for his mistake and , during the past year away from the workplace , ha endeavored to address and reform them . ”
 Mr. Ellison did not specify how . A Skydance spokesman noted that the company ’ s two most senior-ranking woman , Dana Goldberg , chief creative officer , and Anne Globe , chief marketing officer , both supported the decision to bring aboard Mr. Lasseter .
 In an email to Skydance employee , Mr. Ellison said he had hired “ outside counsel to thoroughly investigate the allegation , which we considered serious. ” He did not reveal any of the conclusion but said the company had “ carefully evaluated the finding of this extensive investigation . ”
 In a statement of his own , Mr. Lasseter insisted that he had spent time in “ deep reflection , learning how my action unintentionally made many colleague uncomfortable , which I deeply regret and apologize for. ” He added that he planned to build Skydance Animation in the same way he built Pixar , albeit with a new commitment to “ safety , trust and mutual respect . ”
 He will replace Bill Damaschke , a former DreamWorks Animation executive .
 Time ’ s Up , the organization founded by woman in Hollywood in response to the # MeToo movement , criticized Skydance a “ providing another position of power , prominence and privilege to a man who ha repeatedly been accused of sexual harassment in the workplace. ” The hire , Time ’ s Up added in a statement , “ endorses and perpetuates a broken system that allows powerful men to act without consequence . ”
 Time ’ s Up , whose founder include Reese Witherspoon and Shonda Rhimes , said three thing were needed for men like Mr. Lasseter to return to position of authority : a demonstration of true remorse , deep work to reform their behavior and restitution to those harmed .
 “ Offering a high-profile position to an abuser who ha yet to do any of those thing is condoning abuse , ” the organization said .
 The accusation against Mr. Lasseter did not rise to the level of those against powerful Hollywood figure like Harvey Weinstein , who ha been accused of act of sexual misconduct and rape going back decade , or Leslie Moonves , the former CBS chief who wa found to have engaged in “ multiple act of serious nonconsensual sexual misconduct , ” according to a report by CBS investigator . Both Mr. Weinstein and Mr. Moonves have denied engaging in nonconsensual sexual activity .
 But the complaint made by Pixar and Disney employee against Mr. Lasseter were serious enough to prompt his ouster . The Hollywood Reporter cited “ grabbing , kissing and making comment about physical attribute ” a recurring behavior by Mr. Lasseter in meeting and at work event , particularly when he had consumed alcohol . Multiple staff member — none who came forward publicly — also told manager at Disney that Mr. Lasseter had become increasingly domineering over the year .
 As word spread in Hollywood this week that Mr. Lasseter wa close to finding new employment , several influential woman involved with the # MeToo movement noted that he expressed no regret for his behavior or discussed making effort to reform when he left Disney in June . In a statement at the time , he said he had made his own decision to “ begin focusing on new creative challenge . ”
 Disney had put Mr. Lasseter on leave in November 2017 . At that time , he sent an email to employee at Pixar and the separate Walt Disney Animation studio apologizing “ to anyone who ha ever been on the receiving end of an unwanted hug or any other gesture they felt crossed the line in any way , shape or form . ”
 As Mr. Lasseter looked for a new job in recent month , people in his camp contended that he had been unfairly swept up in the # MeToo movement . At one point , he talked to Warner Bros. about a role there .
 Skydance , based in Santa Monica , ha division dedicated to movie , television and video game . Skydance ’ s recent film include “ Mission : Impossible — Fallout , ” which collected $ 791 million at the box office last year . It control the “ Terminator ” franchise and supply the hit series “ Grace and Frankie ” to Netflix . Coming up , Mr. Ellison is working with Paramount Pictures on a “ Top Gun ” sequel and “ Gemini Man , ” a science-fiction thriller directed by Ang Lee .
 Skydance release most of it movie through Paramount Pictures , which count on Mr. Ellison a a major producing and co-financing partner ( and wa told about Mr. Lasseter ’ s hiring only in the minute before it wa announced ) . Skydance raised $ 700 million in new financing in 2016 .
 Skydance Animation , founded in 2017 , ha not released any film . One of it first movie , “ Luck , ” directed by Alessandro Carloni ( “ Kung Fu Panda 3 ” ) and aimed toward theatrical release by Paramount in 2021 , explores a world where secret organization called Good Luck and Bad Luck secretly control people ’ s life . Another project is an untitled fantasy directed by Vicky Jenson ( “ Shrek ” ) . The division also intends to make animated television show .

 Two week ago , the big movie studio showcased their 2019 lineup for multiplex executive in a series of elaborate marketing presentation in Las Vegas . It ’ s an annual ritual : Here are the potential hit we will deliver .
 For the first time , the importance of onscreen diversity came across a more than lip service . Paramount presented a family adventure ( “ Dora the Lost City of Gold ” ) with a predominantly Latino cast , while Warner Bros. promoted a “ Shaft ” sequel starring Samuel L. Jackson and Regina Hall . Universal touted a comedy starring black woman ( “ Little ” ) , an animated movie about a Chinese girl ’ s quest ( “ Abominable ” ) and a summer musical ( “ Yesterday ” ) with an actor of Indian descent playing the lead .
 But look a little closer at the movie on studio roster — and who is directing them — and Hollywood ’ s inclusion narrative fall apart by one crucial measure . Even after year of being called to task for sidelining female filmmaker , studio a a whole continue to rely overwhelmingly on men to lead production .
 Why the disconnect ?
 Studios have multiple explanation ( some would say excuse ) , but one big reason involves a lack of economic pressure . Moviegoers have been responding favorably to diverse casting and story ( “ Us , ” “ Crazy Rich Asians , ” “ Black Panther ” ) , prompting studio to serve up more . Fewer ticket-buying decision are made based on the gender of the filmmaker , however .
 “ Does a consumer care about how something is made versus what they see onscreen ? ” Cathy Schulman , an Oscar-winning producer ( “ Crash ” ) , said in an interview . “ I think that is becoming increasingly more important , but I would say the business is slower to see the connectivity . ”
 That most studio employ few female director would not surprise anyone who ha been paying attention to the research from academic like Stacy L. Smith at the University of Southern California . But most report on Hollywood hiring offer a rearview portrait ; compiling comprehensive data requires a lag .
 So the of-the-moment snapshot provided by the recent studio presentation is striking .
 During it session on April 3 at CinemaCon , a convention staged by the National Association of Theater Owners , Disney unveiled a 19-film slate for the rest of 2019 , including a batch of movie from the newly acquired 20th Century Fox . Two of the 19 come from woman : Jennifer Lee co-directed “ Frozen II ” and Roxann Dawson directed “ Breakthrough , ” a faith-based drama .
 Warner Bros. ha 15 film , three of which have a woman behind the camera . ( The next one is “ The Sun Is Also a Star , ” a romance from Ry-Russo-Young , which Warner will release on May 17 . ) Paramount currently plan to release seven movie by the end of the year ; “ The Rhythm Section , ” a thriller , is the only one directed by a woman . ( That would be Reed Morano , best known a a cinematographer . )
 Universal Studios ha 15 movie with release date through December . Four come from woman , including “ Little , ” which arrived over the weekend and wa directed by Tina Gordon , and “ Queen & Slim , ” a November drama directed by Melina Matsoukas .
 Sony Pictures opted not to make a presentation at CinemaCon . The studio ha 13 movie on the remainder of it 2019 schedule . Women are directing three of them : “ Charlie ’ s Angels ” ( Elizabeth Banks ) ; “ A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood ” ( Marielle Heller ) ; and “ Little Women ” ( Greta Gerwig ) .
 Disney , Warner , Universal and Sony declined to comment or did not respond to a request for comment .
 Paramount said in a statement , “ We recognize that , a an industry , we need to afford more opportunity to female film director , and at Paramount we have publicly committed to doing a better job. ” Paramount added that , under an initiative announced in February , all of the studio ’ s film and television project must submit a “ diversity and inclusion plan ” before greenlight . Paramount is also participating in a Time ’ s Up-backed effort to boost opportunity for female director .
 The only studio executive who agreed to be interviewed for this article wa Adam Fogelson , the chairman of STXfilms Motion Picture Group , a five-year-old operation . Much of it output involves female-focused movie like the Amy Schumer vehicle “ I Feel Pretty , ” directed by Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein .
 “ We ’ re proud of our track record of making film for , with and by woman , ” Mr. Fogelson said . “ We see it a an important competitive edge. ” He added , however , “ As a husband , a father and a human being in the world , I ’ m eager for the industry to collectively do better on this front . ”
 STX currently ha six film headed to theater by the end of the year , two of which have female director . The first is “ Poms , ” a comedy from Zara Hayes that arrives on May 10 . But Mr. Fogelson said a few month ’ worth of film did not give a sufficient assessment . By his calculation , 18 percent of all STX movie , past and present , have been ( or are being ) directed by woman — and 14 percent have a woman a lead actor , director , producer and writer .
 Widening the aperture make the picture more positive for every studio . Disney recently released “ Captain Marvel , ” with Anna Boden a a director ; in the work are two more Marvel film from woman ( “ Black Widow ” and “ The Eternals ” ) . Warner will release a pair of female-led superhero movie of it own in 2020 — “ Wonder Woman 1984 , ” from Patty Jenkins , and “ Birds of Prey , ” from Cathy Yan . At least 10 film with female director are in development at Paramount , including a new “ Star Trek . ”
 The higher the financial risk , though , the le confidence decision maker have in hiring woman . So , major studio film remain the slowest to embrace opportunity parity . Ms. Schulman , who is a former president of the advocacy group Women in Film , also pointed to the misconception that woman are best at directing personal story about woman and romance , excluding them from opportunity to direct genre associated with men , like action , adventure , espionage , broad comedy , horror , sci-fi and others .
 Martha Lauzen , the executive director of the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film and a professor at San Diego State University , cited research showing that woman accounted for 8 percent of director working on the top 250-grossing movie of 2018 , down one percentage point from 1998 .
 “ We have not seen any meaningful increase , ” she said , “ in the percentage of woman film director over the last 20 year . ”
 An earlier version of this article misidentified the actress who will star in a “ Shaft ” sequel . She is Regina Hall , not Regina King .

 On Wednesday , Kevin Hart definitively ruled out hosting the Oscars on “ Good Morning America , ” even though he had been prodded to reconsider during an interview with Ellen DeGeneres .
 So who is going to host the 2019 Academy Awards ? Is anyone ?
 It ’ s unclear . The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ha said nothing publicly about it and did not respond to a request for comment .
 What do we know ?
 The Oscars are slated to be broadcast on Feb. 24 on ABC , a little over six week away . If there is to be a host , unless it ’ s a last-second reveal , one would have to be announced soon to get ready for the broadcast . The lack of preparation time is one reason Hart gave for not reconsidering the job .
 It should be noted : Robert Iger , chief executive of Disney , which owns ABC , told Variety on the Golden Globes red carpet that he wa “ open-minded ” about Hart coming back a host if Hart apologized for past Twitter post and a joke that were deemed homophobic .
 What have we heard ?
 On Wednesday , Variety , citing anonymous source , reported that the academy wa planning to broadcast the ceremony without a host at all . Instead , a roster of top Hollywood star would rotate through and introduce category . The report suggested that the academy would do away with the traditional opening monologue .
 If true , it would be the first time in three decade that the Oscars would proceed without a host . The last time there wa no emcee , in 1989 , Rob Lowe made , um , history for his duet with Snow White .
 Perhaps fearing that Thanos would make half the Oscar rating disappear , the creative team behind the Oscars is also reportedly trying to reunite a much of the cast of Marvel ’ s “ Avengers ” franchise a possible to play a role on the telecast , according to another anonymously sourced report , this one from The Hollywood Reporter . That article also said that cast member of the Marvel juggernaut were asked not to be presenter at the Golden Globes , to ensure that their appearance at the Oscars would be more superpowerful , er , powerful .
 And just to map out all the way corporate synergy play a part here : The final “ Avengers ” movie — “ Avengers : Endgame ” — is due April 26 , and this would undoubtedly help the movie ’ s marketing . Marvel is owned by Disney , and Disney owns ABC , which is broadcasting the ceremony .
 If Hart hosted , what would it have looked like ?
 We got a small preview of what a Hart-led Oscars would look like on Wednesday , when he appeared on “ The Late Show With Stephen Colbert . ”
 “ I wa going to be good . I had some stuff . I had some heat , ” Hart told Colbert .
 Some of the joke were about meme . Hart said he wanted to break the tension since “ they ’ re not there to laugh , because everybody ’ s waiting for their moment. ” He would tell everyone to relax and not become a meme . Colbert then proceeded to share some of Hart ’ s example of previous awards-show meme , like one of Nicole Kidman being caught midclap ( Hart referred to her “ boomerang ” hand ) , and another one of Meryl Streep yelling from the audience .
 “ The whole intent behind them would be , you don ’ t want to be that , so relax , loosen up and have a good time , ” Hart said . “ Then I wa going to go into a bunch of crazy bit . It wa going to be fire , ” Hart said .
 When Colbert asked Hart who he thought should host , Hart said , “ Whoever is wanting and willing of the job . ”

 President Trump ’ s election made the Murdoch family more powerful than ever . But the bitter struggle between James and Lachlan threatened to tear the company apart .
 Part 2 : Internal Divisions President Trump ’ s election made the Murdoch family more powerful than ever . But the bitter struggle between James and Lachlan threatened to tear the company apart .

 This is Part 2 of a three-part story . Go back and read Part 1 .
 In a matter of month , Rupert Murdoch had married a former supermodel , led Britain ’ s historic vote to break with the European Union and played a pivotal role in the American election . He now had a close relationship with the British prime minister , Theresa May , and an even closer one with the incoming American president , Donald J. Trump . But his medium empire wa more vulnerable than ever . Netflix , Amazon , Apple and a host of other new technology company were streaming content directly to consumer and were growing at unabated rate across the globe . It wa an overwhelming existential challenge to legacy medium company like 21st Century Fox . Once viewed a a global colossus , Murdoch ’ s empire wa now in danger of being too small . He desperately needed international scale to compete . The answer seemed obvious : The Murdochs had to take full control of Sky .
 With annual revenue of some $ 16 billion , Sky wa the largest pay-TV provider in Britain and across Europe . The Murdochs currently owned only 39 percent of it , and that share already generated the company three time the revenue of Fox News . What ’ s more , Sky had it own 24-hour news channel in Britain , Sky News , which could be built into a global news network to take on the Murdochs ’ longtime rival , the publicly financed BBC .
 For James , who would be leading the Sky acquisition , the potential deal also represented something more personal : an opportunity for redemption . He tried to buy Sky five year earlier , in part by forging a close alliance with David Cameron , then a Conservative member of Parliament who wa eyeing the prime ministership . What began with Cameron ’ s dropping by a Murdoch family vacation near the Greek isle of Santorini turned into a mutually beneficial friendship between James and the candidate . The aim of both party were clear . Cameron wanted the support of the Murdochs . James wanted Ofcom , the British regulatory agency that would rule on whether the Murdochs were “ fit and proper ” operator of Sky , out of his way . With the 2010 election approaching , Cameron publicly promised that under a Conservative government , “ Ofcom a we know it will cease to exist. ” Not long after , James summoned Cameron to the George , a private club in the Mayfair area of London , to tell him that The Sun would reverse 12 year of support for the Labor Party and endorse him . ( James and Cameron have each denied that there wa any quid pro quo for the endorsement . ) But just a James wa getting all of the piece in place , the phone-hacking scandal broke . He and his father were hauled in front of Parliament , and James wa forced to withdraw their $ 12 billion bid for Sky . Ofcom survived .
 [ Read 6 takeaway from this story . ]
 Lachlan and others inside 21st Century Fox were concerned about James ’ s leading this second Sky bid , given how closely associated he had been with the hacking scandal and with the family ’ s first failed attempt to gain full control of the satellite company . But James , who knew the company best , wa adamant , and in December 2016 , he struck a new deal with the owner of Sky . The lawyer for 21st Century Fox , Allen & Overy , sent a lengthy memo to Karen Bradley , Britain ’ s secretary of state for culture , medium and sport , detailing why this bid wa different from the earlier one . Not only had the Murdochs shut down The News of the World , the newspaper that had been found guilty of widespread hacking ; they had also divided the empire into two different entity : News Corp and 21st Century Fox . The company that would be purchasing Sky , 21st Century Fox , had thus been separated from the family ’ s newspaper . Further , the lawyer wrote that the company ’ s culture had changed substantially since the hacking scandal : It “ ha adopted strong governance measure and control to ensure it meet the highest standard of corporate conduct. ” James expressed similar confidence on a conference call with Wall Street analyst : “ We do think that this pass regulatory muster , ” he said .
 One other factor made the proposed deal especially attractive . Thanks to Brexit , the Murdochs would be getting full ownership of Sky at the steeply discounted price of $ 14.8 billion if the deal went through . The British government wa paralyzed , unable to reach an agreement to implement the break with the European bloc . Foreign company were pulling out of Britain , destabilizing the country ’ s job market and the economy and , in turn , significantly depressing the value of the English pound — and with it , the price of Sky ’ s share .
 All that needed to happen wa for the government to approve the deal . With the Sky bid once again pending before Ofcom , James embarked on a campaign of contrition and humility designed to convince the British establishment that he and his family business could be trusted to own Sky .
 Even a James wa pursuing his bid to take full control of Sky in Britain , the company ’ s Australian division — Lachlan ’ s domain — wa closing a much smaller but still significant deal for the family to take full control of a different Sky subsidiary : Sky News Australia , which it jointly owned with two Australian medium company . It wa the country ’ s only 24-hour cable news channel and an unexploited opportunity for influence on another continent .
 The Murdochs ’ newspaper holding accounted for some 60 percent of the Australian print market , and included the country ’ s sole national general-interest paper , The Australian . As the face of this continental newspaper empire , Lachlan wielded an enormous amount of political power in the country . Over the previous decade , Murdoch paper helped push out two different prime minister , Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard . When Gillard ’ s treasurer , Wayne Swan , wa worried that the Murdoch attack were hurting the national economy , he sought out Lachlan to make an appeal , Swan told u . Lachlan built alliance , too , drawing close to Tony Abbott , a member of Parliament whose right-wing politics and confrontational style had earned him frequent comparison to Newt Gingrich . When Abbott served a prime minister , from 2013 to 2015 , he would discus legislation with the Murdochs ’ editor — and occasionally the Murdochs themselves — before introducing it , the former editor of The Australian , Chris Mitchell , wrote in his memoir .
 Now Murdoch ’ s Australian empire wa expanding into cable news . The country ’ s dominant broadcaster wa the Australian Broadcast Corporation , a publicly financed institution modeled after the BBC . Its reporting wa similarly straight and sober . Sky News Australia — which also air in New Zealand — wa , notionally , a competitor , but it audience wa small , even by Australian standard . Still , the network offered Lachlan his own opportunity for redemption : After his split with his father , he presided over the implosion of the Australian TV network Ten . His failed effort to save it included giving a reality-TV dance show to his wife and signing off on a weekly show for a controversial right-wing firebrand , Andrew Bolt . A columnist at the Murdoch-owned Herald Sun , Bolt had impressed Lachlan year earlier at a company retreat in Pebble Beach , Calif. , when he aggressively questioned Al Gore after Gore presented his slide show on climate change . When Bolt wa awarded his show on Ten , he wa facing charge for violating the country ’ s Racial Discrimination Act by writing that light-skinned Aborigines were claiming indigenous status for personal gain . ( Bolt wa found guilty , and the publisher wa forced to print a lengthy statement acknowledging the offense . )


 With the acquisition of Sky News Australia , Lachlan would have a second chance . The Murdochs won full control of the network in December 2016 , while James ’ s Sky deal in Britain wa still pending . Sky News Australia ’ s programming had historically been politically balanced . But a the Murdochs ’ takeover approached , the network began increasing the amount of right-wing commentary it broadcast during prime time .
 Not long before the deal closed , Lachlan ’ s old Ten host Andrew Bolt wa brought in to do a nightly political program . Immediately after the purchase , Sky signed up a a host and commentator Caroline Marcus , a columnist for The Daily Telegraph of Sydney who had supported a ban on burkinis in France and lamented what she described a reverse discrimination against white in cultural debate . Ross Cameron — a former member of the Australian Parliament prone to anti-gay slur who later spoke at an event hosted by a far-right organization that describes itself a Australia ’ s leading anti-Islamic group — co-hosted a program called “ The Outsiders. ” He and his fellow host described themselves a “ Trump ’ s Aussie mate ” and half-joked that their show would provide “ absolutely no balance whatsoever. ” After one host , Mark Latham , wa fired for making a series of offensive comment , including a homophobic remark about a high school student who participated in a video for International Women ’ s Day , he ran successfully for state office a a member of One Nation , the country ’ s far-right anti-immigrant party . Soon after Lachlan took over , an old political ally , Tony Abbott ’ s former chief of staff , Peta Credlin , became a prime-time host on Sky . Still closely allied with Abbott , she used her platform to argue that Australia should slow down it effort to combat climate change , take a stricter line on immigration and resist the liberal drift of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull , a bitter Abbott rival .
 Known a Sky After Dark , the opinion-heavy , almost-uniformly right-wing lineup wa an entirely new phenomenon in Australian TV . Its nighttime rating spiked a the network quickly became required viewing for the country ’ s political class .
 By the early month of 2017 , Murdoch ’ s interim leadership of Fox News , which started with Ailes ’ s ouster before the election , wa now beginning to look permanent . He installed beneath him two of Ailes ’ s loyal deputy : Jack Abernethy , who wa in charge of operation , and Bill Shine , a close friend of Hannity ’ s who had been overseeing the opinion lineup but would now also run the entire news operation . Neither wa known for his independent thinking . A rival executive called Shine “ the butler ” because of his uncanny tendency to appear at Ailes ’ s side to address his need . Even a Murdoch wa elevating Shine , numerous accusation — some of them in lawsuit against Ailes — were surfacing that Shine had protected and even enabled Ailes during his year of allegedly sexually harassing woman at the network . ( Shine ha denied any wrongdoing . )
 After the election , Murdoch moved even more forcefully to support Trump . When Greta Van Susteren , a former CNN host and a somewhat ideologically unpredictable presence in the Fox lineup , left the network , Murdoch enthusiastically endorsed the idea of replacing her at 7 p.m. with Tucker Carlson — a conservative writer and a founder of the Daily Caller website who wa earning praise from white nationalist heading into Trump ’ s election . Murdoch marked the occasion by taking Carlson out to brunch with Jerry Hall in New York . When Megyn Kelly , who sealed her fame by clashing with Trump , left Fox in early 2017 , Murdoch opted not to replace her with another Trump antagonist .
 Murdoch also kept in close touch with the White House . He and Kushner had always spoken frequently , but now he wa in regular contact with Trump too . Trump enjoyed getting his call . As someone who prized wealth and power , Trump had long admired Murdoch ; for decade , it had invariably been Trump who called Murdoch , asking for help . Now it wa Murdoch reaching out to Trump on a regular basis . “ Rupert , Rupert ! ” Trump would say , talking on the phone with Murdoch in the Oval Office , according to a former White House official who overheard the conversation . “ You love the action , don ’ t you ? You can ’ t get enough of this shit . ”
 Trump wa also spending a lot of time on the phone with Hannity , who regularly called the president after his show . Trump had often found him to be too much of a supplicant for his purpose : He preferred his more combative interview with Bill O ’ Reilly , which he felt better showcased his pugnaciousness , according to a former White House official . But Trump appreciated Hannity ’ s loyalty . The Fox host had effectively been a member of his campaign team , for instance pressing Trump ’ s personal lawyer , Michael Cohen , to be on the lookout for former girlfriend and employee who might make trouble for the candidate ahead of the election , two people familiar with the interaction told u . ( Hannity , through a Fox representative , denies having done so . ) His show became a nightly hourlong campaign infomercial . Hannity ’ s audience wa Trump ’ s most devoted base . In an interview with The New York Times , Ailes once described Hannity a presiding over a “ segmented ” show whose appeal wa limited to hard-core conservative . Now he wa the network ’ s biggest star . He set the tone for the rest of Fox ’ s opinion lineup , which quickly became a nightly counterpoint to the mainstream medium ’ s coverage of Trump .
 As a former medium adviser , Ailes recognized that the Fox News brand depended on the perception that it wa a credible alternative to the liberal medium . He would even sometimes rein in his opinion host when their rhetoric threatened to undermine that perception . Ailes also thought that presenting a monolithic view night after night wa bad television . He wa careful to make sure that the network always had some host who challenged Republican orthodoxy at least occasionally .
 These were matter that did not appear to concern Murdoch . Some of the network ’ s news anchor could deliver at time stark counterprogramming to opinion host like Hannity . Shepard Smith became increasingly pointed in his critical coverage of Trump , expressing disbelief at the “ lie after lie after lie ” coming from the administration ; the Fox anchor Chris Wallace emerged a one of the toughest interrogator of Trump surrogate and official on television ; and Bret Baier ’ s straight coverage regularly infuriated Trump . But the network ’ s prime-time lineup is it biggest draw , and by the fall of 2017 , that lineup wa notably more pro-Trump than it wa under Ailes , with Carlson at 8 , Hannity at 9 and the right-wing radio star Laura Ingraham at 10 . They were joined , of course , by the morning host on “ Fox & Friends , ” the show with which Trump always started his day .
 Years earlier , when James wa fighting in Britain for the first failed Sky deal , he expressed contempt for government meddling in the medium ’ s affair and impugned the nationally esteemed BBC a a “ chilling ” medium monolith . “ The only reliable , durable and perpetual guarantor of independence , ” he said in a lecture at the annual Edinburgh International Television Festival , “ is profit. ” In the spring of 2017 , a James made the round with civic and business leader in London , he took a far more conciliatory tack . He praised the BBC and assured former critic that he respected Britain ’ s strict regulation designed to ensure impartiality in England ’ s news coverage . At an annual conference held by the influential medium analyst Claire Enders , a leading critic of his first Sky bid , James professed an “ aspiration for u to be better ” and promised to “ behave in the way that we imagined we would want to and be expected to in the future . ”
 Even a James wa in the midst of this campaign , the company ’ s behavior wa once again threatening to jeopardize the Sky deal . In April 2017 , The New York Times reported that the Fox News host Bill O ’ Reilly and the network had doled out some $ 13 million to address multiple complaint from woman about O ’ Reilly ’ s lewd comment and unwanted advance and that Fox had nevertheless renewed his contract for $ 25 million . Ofcom wa soon receiving submission from O ’ Reilly ’ s victim . Lisa Bloom , a lawyer representing one of his accuser , drew a direct link between Fox ’ s sexual-harassment scandal and the phone hacking : Both , she wrote , revealed “ a lack of oversight , intervention and decency . ”
 After James and several other senior executive from 21st Century Fox were grilled about the company ’ s culture by Ofcom regulator in the agency ’ s headquarters overlooking the Thames , the Murdochs scrambled to protect their Sky bid . They quickly fired O ’ Reilly , giving him a $ 25 million exit package . When rumor started circulating that Ailes ’ s once-loyal lieutenant , Shine , might be next , Hannity tried to protect him , sensing that his old friend and ally wa about to become a victim of the Murdochs ’ broader global agenda : “ Somebody HIGH UP AND INSIDE FNC is trying to get an innocent person fired , ” he tweeted , presumably referring to James . Shine wa pushed out , too .
 In June 2017 , Ofcom finally issued it report on the acquisition : It recommended that the deal be reviewed by yet another regulatory body . The Competition and Markets Authority would investigate whether Sky would give the Murdochs too much influence over the British medium .
 The decision set off still more scrambling . To prevent any potential problem with the British regulator , Fox executive directed a furious Hannity to dial down his coverage of the death of a Democratic National Committee staff member named Seth Rich , which had spurred wild conspiracy theory and wide public criticism , a well a an advertiser boycott . The Murdochs also pulled Fox News off the air in Britain , where it had been the subject of several formal complaint of “ unfair and inaccurate content. ” ( A separate investigation by British regulator found that Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson had violated British impartiality standard : Hannity for ridiculing critic of Trump ’ s proposed travel ban without presenting a full version of their view or giving them an opportunity to respond , and Carlson for allowing Nigel Farage to make baseless claim that British official had failed to protect “ thousand of underage girl ” from rape and abuse by Muslims . )


 In September 2017 , James delivered the keynote address at the Royal Television Society ’ s annual convention in Cambridge , using the occasion to make the case for the Sky deal and to sketch out his vision for the future of the global medium company that he still hoped to run . He ticked off some of 21st Century Fox ’ s better-known brand — National Geographic , FX , Fox Sports , Sky Atlantic — and described how these and other outlet had “ explored the opioid epidemic , gender identity and race relation ” and “ told powerful story of slavery in America , the right of woman in Pakistan and the coming and inevitable exploration of Mars. ” Absent from his list , and from his entire address , wa one of 21st Century Fox ’ s best-known brand , Fox News . In the question-and-answer session that followed , an interviewer speculated about why the deal wa taking so long . “ I wonder if the message that come through , ” she said , “ is that you presided over this rotten culture at News International and , again , at Fox News , and that people just don ’ t trust you . Is that what you think the message is ? ”
 That November , a bipartisan coalition of British member of Parliament took their concern about the deal to a hearing in Victoria House on Southampton Row , the headquarters of the Competition and Markets Authority . They were led by Ed Miliband , a former leader of the Labor Party and a supporter of antimonopoly medium legislation who had tangled with the Murdochs a couple of year earlier , when The Sun fulminated against his candidacy for prime minister , dubbing him Red Ed and Shameful Mili . They highlighted Fox ’ s promotion of the Seth Rich conspiracy and it airing of false claim that there were zone in London controlled by Shariah law . If the Murdochs gained full control of the satellite broadcast company , the M.P.s warned , they could transform it 24-hour news channel , Sky News , into a British version of Fox News . The question of the Murdochs ’ influence over the medium led , inevitably , to the question of the Murdochs ’ influence over the country ’ s politics . “ I know Rupert , ” Ken Clarke , a member of Parliament , said . “ The idea that Rupert is interested in a detached influence in the politics of the country where he owns his medium — anybody who knew him , you could not put that proposition to them without them breaking into a very broad smile . ”
 In January 2018 , the Competition and Markets Authority issued it ruling on 21st Century Fox ’ s acquisition of Sky : Full ownership of the company would give the Murdochs “ too much control over news provider in the U.K. across all medium platform ( TV , radio , online and newspaper ) and therefore too much influence over public opinion and the political agenda. ” It wa a full-blown repudiation , setting up a final ruling that no member of the Murdoch family should ever be allowed to serve in any capacity at Sky — not even on the company ’ s board . It would be an especially harsh blow to James , who wa serving a Sky ’ s chairman at the time .
 For Lachlan , it wa a validation of his view that James wa the wrong public face of the campaign for Sky , reminding the public of the hacking scandal and all the hostility toward the Murdochs it had stirred up . For James , the failure of the deal wa a bitter vindication of his view that his family ’ s empire could not survive it own politics and culture .
 In early August 2017 , Rupert Murdoch invited Robert A. Iger , the chief executive of Disney , to Moraga , his $ 28.8 million Tuscan-style vineyard estate in the hill of Bel Air , and offered him a glass of wine . The two mogul commiserated about the threat they both faced from the new breed of tech giant and what they could do to confront it . Disney also wanted to get bigger . Talk about combining some of their asset soon evolved into something much more significant : a conversation about Iger ’ s buying 21st Century Fox , the Hollywood studio that Murdoch wrested away from the Colorado oilman Marvin Davis in 1985 . For 65 year , Murdoch had been ruthlessly expanding his empire . He wa now thinking about doing the most un-Murdochian thing imaginable : He wa going to shrink it .
 It wa , in a sense , an admission of defeat . Murdoch ’ s ambition had been subverted , finally and definitively , by his own failing — the family squabble , the reactionary drift of Fox News , the Sky News debacle . But he had a new plan . He would cleave off the Hollywood studio that wa responsible for about two-thirds of the company ’ s revenue and keep his main tool of influence , his newspaper and Fox News . James would move on , perhaps following 21st Century Fox to Disney , and he and Lachlan would run the remaining leaner , scrappier company together like a pirate ship .
 The decision wa driven not only by the imperative of the business but also by those of the Murdoch family . Joint custody of the empire wasn ’ t working . It wa easy for the company ’ s senior executive to see which one Murdoch preferred — Murdoch ’ s face would light up when Lachlan would roll his chair nearer to him at meeting — and they quickly learned which son to go to with question and request . ( “ And Lachlan ? ” Murdoch would ask , whenever executive told him that they had spoken to James about something . ) As James saw it , his brother wa mainly interested in the unique fringe benefit and trapping of power that came with the job . He bristled when Lachlan built a rock-climbing wall on an old soundstage on the studio lot and hired a private security guard to accompany him everywhere . Lachlan , meanwhile , chafed at James ’ s fixation on corporate governance , which he felt wa inconsistent with the company ’ s swashbuckling spirit .
 The Trump presidency wa also exposing a deeper divide between the brother . James wa becoming increasingly troubled by Fox News . He didn ’ t object to the idea of a conservative news network , but he did object to what he felt it had evolved into at certain hour : a political weapon with no editorial standard or concern for the value of truth and a knee-jerk defender of the president ’ s rhetoric and policy . After Trump issued his executive order banning immigration from some Muslim-majority country in early 2017 , James pushed his father and Lachlan to agree to write a companywide memo reassuring it Muslim employee in the United States and abroad . James wanted the note to forcefully and unequivocally establish their opposition to the policy and to tell employee who felt threatened by it that the company would do everything in it power to protect them . Lachlan wanted it to be le confrontational and to not specifically mention Trump or the Muslim ban , which Fox News ’ s opinion host were defending night after night . Even getting Lachlan ’ s approval for the watered-down version that ultimately went out wa “ like pulling teeth , ” James would later say privately , according to people close to him .
 Months later , when Trump blamed “ both side ” for the violence at a white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville , Va. , saying that there were some “ very fine people ” among the white supremacist , Kathryn insisted that they write their own open letter of opposition , without consulting with his brother or father first . “ If we ’ re not going to say something about [ expletive ] Nazis marching in Virginia , when are we going to say something ? ” she told James , according to a person familiar with the conversation .
 Kathryn had historically kept her complaint about the network and the business inside the family , in accordance with the unofficial Murdoch code of conduct . But Fox opinion host ’ embrace of nativism and white nationalism during Trump ’ s rise had eroded her restraint . Her frustration with the family business occasionally broke through on her Twitter account . She wrote supportive reply to post from the Parkland shooting survivor and gun-control activist David Hogg — who had been taunted by Laura Ingraham over his college rejection and wa leading an advertising boycott against her show — a well a from Never Trump Republicans like Bill Kristol who had left the network . And she complimented a Washington Post opinion article that noted that the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer had praised Carlson for “ covering all our talking point . ”
 The resentment that had been steadily building between James and Lachlan over the past two and a half year exploded in the fall of 2018 , a the Disney deal became a possibility , then a probability and then a reality .
 James instantly seized on the idea , seeing it both a a way out of the family business and a a possible route to the biggest job in the medium . He started speaking with Iger separately over lunch and meeting , discussing among other thing what role he might play at Disney . Iger wa in his late 60 ; his contract wa set to expire in the summer of 2019 , and the company had not yet named a successor . A top job in Disney ’ s corporate hierarchy could put James in the running to take over . It had long been his dream to run his family ’ s empire , but Disney , when combined with 21st Century Fox , would be more than three time it size — the largest medium conglomerate in the world , one with no ideological baggage to prevent it from growing and evolving further . James immediately championed the deal during his conversation with fellow 21st Century Fox board member .
 Lachlan wa furious . His father wa talking about dismantling the empire not even three year after coaxing him back from Australia to run it , an empire that had taken a lifetime to build . He argued that 21st Century Fox wa big enough to compete a it wa . The smaller piece of the empire that he would be left with — a network with an aging audience in the increasingly anachronistic business of cable television — wa hardly a growth business . As the talk with Iger progressed , Lachlan ’ s opposition hardened . “ Why the [ expletive ] would I want to run this company ? ” he told people close to him . Lachlan ’ s anger at his father boiled over during a dinner in Manhattan in the fall of 2017 , three people who were familiar with the incident told u . “ If you take one more call on this deal , you will not have a son ! ” he threatened . “ I will never talk to you again. ” ( Representatives for Murdoch and Lachlan denied that he made these threat . )
 Over the course of our reporting , we spoke to a dozen people with direct knowledge of the Disney negotiation . What emerged were two diametrically different narrative of how the next act in the history of the Murdoch dynasty unfolded . Those closer to James say that Lachlan saw his birthright slipping away and tried to undermine the deal , even encouraging a rival bid from a different company that wouldn ’ t buy a many of 21st Century Fox ’ s asset . Those closer to Lachlan say that James wa pushing the deal forward to advance his own career ambition and wa ready to settle for le than they could get for their father ’ s life ’ s work . Lachlan ’ s perception wa affirmed , they said , when his father told him that he had received a call from a banker on the deal , reporting that James wa trying to make his future at Disney part of the negotiation . Murdoch personally assured Iger that it wasn ’ t . ( People closer to James say that there wa no attempt to make the deal contingent on his role at Disney and that his primary concern wa reaching the best agreement for the family and the shareholder . )
 The family ’ s dysfunctional dynamic were readily apparent to Iger . Seeing James a a strong champion of the deal , he kept him close during the negotiation but never committed to offering him a specific , high-level position ; publicly , he said only that he wa considering the issue .
 Negotiations nearly fell apart in October , according to Securities and Exchange Commission filing , when Murdoch called Iger to say that Disney ’ s valuation of the company wa “ inadequate ” and that talk should “ cease. ” But they kept talking , meeting in London — Iger had come for the premiere of Disney ’ s “ Star Wars : The Last Jedi ” — to iron out more detail . On Dec. 13 , 2017 , they announced an initial deal valued at $ 52.4 billion .
 Accompanying the announcement wa a photograph of Iger and Murdoch , their arm placed awkwardly on each other ’ s shoulder , standing on the rooftop of a London building , St. Paul ’ s Cathedral looming in the background . It wa a peculiar image : the mogul who built the country ’ s most polarizing , rage-stoking political brand beside the one who presided over a medium conglomerate whose very name wa synonymous with equanimity and uplift . Inside the Murdoch empire , the incompatibility of Fox News and 21st Century Fox had long been a source of private complaint and ironic humor : “ The Simpsons , ” a Fox show , once parodied Fox News with a rolling news ticker featuring headline like “ Do Democrats Cause Cancer ? ” and “ Study : 92 Percent of Democrats Are Gay. ” Showrunners on the West Coast would press the Murdochs to get the network under control when a Fox News host would say something they considered offensive , for instance during the network ’ s coverage of the Charlottesville rally . But for many 21st Century Fox executive , the offense had become a nightly occurrence during the Trump era , a the network ’ s opinion host fueled white resentment and anti-immigrant furor . Now , 21st Century Fox would be merged into a company that famously and assiduously avoided politics .
 As for Fox News , the network would have one fewer corporate impediment preventing it from giving it viewer what they wanted .

 “ Mary Poppins Returns , ” which picked up four Oscar nomination last week , is an enjoyably derivative film that seek to inspire our nostalgia for the innocent fantasy of childhood , a well a the jolly holiday that the first “ Mary Poppins ” film conjured for many adult viewer .
 Part of the new film ’ s nostalgia , however , is bound up in a blackface performance tradition that persists throughout the Mary Poppins canon , from P. L. Travers ’ s book to Disney ’ s 1964 adaptation , with disturbing echo in the studio ’ s newest take on the material , “ Mary Poppins Returns . ”
 One of the more indelible image from the 1964 film is of Mary Poppins blacking up . When the magical nanny ( played by Julie Andrews ) accompanies her young charge , Michael and Jane Banks , up their chimney , her face get covered in soot , but instead of wiping it off , she gamely powder her nose and cheek even blacker . Then she lead the child on a dancing exploration of London rooftop with Dick Van Dyke ’ s sooty chimney sweep , Bert .
 This might seem like an innocuous comic scene if Travers ’ s novel didn ’ t associate chimney sweep ’ blackened face with racial caricature . “ Don ’ t touch me , you black heathen , ” a housemaid scream in “ Mary Poppins Opens the Door ” ( 1943 ) , a a sweep reach out his darkened hand . When he try to approach the cook , she threatens to quit : “ If that Hottentot go into the chimney , I shall go out the door , ” she say , using an archaic slur for black South Africans that recurs on page and screen .
 The 1964 film replay this racial panic in a farcical key . When the dark figure of the chimney sweep step in time on a roof , a naval buffoon , Admiral Boom , shout , “ We ’ re being attacked by Hottentots ! ” and order his cannon to be fired at the “ cheeky devils. ” We ’ re in on the joke , such a it is : These aren ’ t really black Africans ; they ’ re grinning white dancer in blackface . It ’ s a parody of black menace ; it ’ s even posted on a white nationalist website a evidence of the film ’ s racial hierarchy . And it ’ s not only fool like the Admiral who invoke this language . In the 1952 novel “ Mary Poppins in the Park , ” the nanny herself tell an upset young Michael , “ I understand that you ’ re behaving like a Hottentot . ”
 “ Mary Poppins Returns , ” set in the 1930s , seems to offer a more racially inclusive vision of the Banks ’ s London ( at least among the working class ) . But a key sequence of the film play into a much more fraught history from a suppressed part of Mary Poppins ’ s past .
 [ Read our review of “ Mary Poppins Returns . ” ]
 In Travers ’ s first “ Mary Poppins ” novel , published in 1934 , a magic compass transport the child around the world , including a stop where they meet a scantily clad “ negro lady , ” dandling “ a tiny black pickaninny with nothing on at all. ” ( “ Pickaninny ” ha long been seen a an offensive term for a black child . ) She address Mary Poppins in minstrel dialect and invokes the convention of blacking up : “ My , but dem ’ s very white baby . You wan ’ use a li ’ l bit black boot polish on dem . ”
 This episode proved so controversial that the book wa banned by the San Francisco Public Library , prompting Travers to drop the racialized dialogue and change the offending caricature to an animal . ( A number of British author built on the tradition of turning American minstrelsy into animal fable : Beatrix Potter and A . A. Milne both cited Uncle Remus dialect story , including “ Br ’ er Rabbit ” tale , a inspiration . )
 In Travers ’ s 1981 revision , the “ negro lady ” became a hyacinth macaw who speaks genteel English . Travers , who wa born in Australia to Anglo-Irish parent , claimed that black child loved reading the “ pickaninny dialect ” in her book , but that she made the change because she didn ’ t wish to see “ Mary Poppins tucked away in a closet ” by meddlesome adult .
 I wa surprised to see that hyacinth macaw pop up in “ Mary Poppins Returns. ” In the middle of a fantasy sequence , Emily Blunt ’ s nanny bound onstage at a music hall to join Lin-Manuel Miranda ’ s lamplighter for a saucy Cockney number , “ A Cover Is Not the Book , ” which retells story from Travers ’ s novel . One of these verse refers to a wealthy widow called Hyacinth Macaw , and the kicker is that she ’ s naked : Blunt sings that “ she only wore a smile , ” and Miranda chime in , “ plus two feather and a leaf . ”
 In the 1981 revision of “ Mary Poppins , ” there ’ s no mention of her attire ; you ’ d have to go back to the 1934 original to find the “ negro lady ” with “ a very few clothes on , ” sitting under a palm tree with a “ crown of feathers. ” There ’ s even a straw hut behind Blunt and Miranda that replicates Mary Shepard ’ s 1934 illustration . ( The hut wa removed in the 1981 revision . )
 The lesson of this music hall number is that “ a king may be a crook , ” a clue that Colin Firth ’ s kindly banker in the film might be more nefarious . As Eric Lott and other cultural historian have documented , there wa an important connection between blackface performance and American and British working-class audience ; minstrelsy offered both a chance to define their whiteness in opposition to black caricature and to thumb their nose at employer through the minstrel ’ antic .
 When T.D . Rice , a popular white minstrel performer , crossed the Atlantic in the 1830s , his manager recalled that he inspired chimney sweep and apprentice , who “ wheeled about and turned about and jumped Jim Crow , from morning until night , to the annoyance of their master , but the great delight of the cockney . ”
 These chimney sweep with minstrel dance were only a step in time away from Dick Van Dyke ’ s soot-faced Bert , needling the admiral on the rooftop , or Miranda ’ s lamplighter in “ Mary Poppins Returns , ” who worked for Bert a a child . The minstrel stage convention of the “ pickaninny ” rendered black slave child a cheery performer who , the historian Robin Bernstein argues , were “ comically impervious to pain ” inflicted by their labor . Similarly , the dark-lit grin and unflappable footwork of the lamplighter turn their dangerous labor into comic play ; “ smile and smirk , ” they sing , is Cockney rhyming slang for “ work . ”
 That minstrel history run not only through Travers ’ s book ; it ’ s also a mainstay of Disney musical , including the jiving blackbird credited a Jim Crow in the 1941 “ Dumbo ” ( “ I be done seen ’ bout ev ’ ything when I see an elephant fly ” ) .
 Blackface minstrelsy , in fact , could be said to be part of Disney ’ s origin story . In an early Mickey Mouse short , a 1933 parody of the antislavery novel “ Uncle Tom ’ s Cabin ” called “ Mickey ’ s Mellerdrammer , ” Mickey black his face with dynamite to play Topsy , a crazy-haired , raggedy-dressed , comically unruly black child from the book whose name had become synonymous with the pickaninny stereotype .
 In “ Mary Poppins Returns , ” the name of the crazy-haired , raggedy-dressed , comically unruly character ( played by Meryl Streep ) is also Topsy . She ’ s a variation on a Mr. Turvy in the novel “ Mary Poppins Comes Back ” ( 1935 ) , whose workshop flip upside-down .
 Even if these character ’ shared name is accidental , it speaks to a larger point : Disney ha long evoked minstrelsy for it topsy-turvy entertainment — a nanny blacking up , chimney sweep mocking the upper class , grinning lamplighter turning work into song .
 In this latest version , Mary Poppins might be serenading Disney genre , outdated but strangely recurring , in the Oscar-nominated song “ The Place Where Lost Things Go , ” when she reminds u that “ Nothing ’ s gone forever , only out of place . ”

 A stunt that went wrong on the set of the TV show “ L.A. ’ s Finest ” last week , leaving two producer injured , is the latest in a string of incident that have drawn renewed attention to the danger of stunt work . It came just day after the Occupational Safety and Health Administration cited a subsidiary of CBS for a stunt-related injury , and after a lawsuit wa filed by the widow of a man who worked a a stunt double .
 The “ L.A. ’ s Finest ” accident , which occurred Thursday on the set of the drama series , involved a stunt with a vehicle . “ The vehicle ’ s trajectory led to a collision with set piece in the safe viewing area , ” said Philip Sokoloski , a spokesman for FilmLA , the official film office for the City and County of Los Angeles . The show is produced by Sony Pictures Television and is set to premiere this spring on Spectrum a the cable provider ’ s first original series .
 The two producer who were injured were transported to two different hospital in the area for treatment , Sokoloski said . He said that filming scheduled for Feb. 22 had been postponed .
 The Sony Pictures Television president , Jeff Frost , and co-presidents Chris Parnell and Jason Clodfelter , said in a statement : “ Our heart go out to our SPT family member who were injured and we pray for a full recovery. ” The California Division of Occupational Safety and Health , Cal/OSHA , confirmed that it wa investigating the accident .
 Stunt work is a sometimes dangerous and physically difficult subset of the entertainment industry . In a report in The New York Times in 2017 , some stuntmen and woman described a macho culture and a “ gung-ho mentality. ” Safety concern have been raised for decade , especially after the death of an actor and two child in a helicopter crash on the set of “ Twilight Zone : The Movie ” in 1982 , but there ha been little success in effort toward regulation . Fatalities are uncommon , although in 2017 , a stuntwoman died on the set of “ Deadpool 2 ” and a stuntman died on the set of “ The Walking Dead. ” Data about injury on set are sketchy and unreliable , a are most workplace safety statistic , which largely rely on information self-reported by employer .
 But recent regulatory action brought some safety issue to light again : Last week , OSHA cited Eye Productions Inc. , a division of CBS , for “ failing to protect employee from hazard ” in August 2018 . A man wa injured on the set of “ MacGyver ” while performing a stunt on a moving vehicle traveling at 18 mile per hour ; OSHA said he did not have “ adequate head protection. ” The proposed penalty is $ 9,472 .
 A representative for CBS declined to comment on the citation and the fine .
 Also last week , the widow of the former football player and stunt double Darryl Hammond filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of the County of Los Angeles that named the Walt Disney Company , Paramount Pictures and Columbia Pictures a defendant , along with the Arena Football League . The suit claim that while filming movie including “ The Longest Yard ” and “ Invincible , ” Hammond , who died in 2017 , suffered traumatic head injury that exposed him to neurodegenerative disease . It alleges negligence , wrongful death and breach of contract , among other thing . Representatives for Disney and Paramount did not immediately respond to request for comment on the lawsuit ; a spokeswoman for Sony Pictures Entertainment , of which Columbia Pictures is a subsidiary , declined to comment .

 The phenomenally popular ( and lucrative ) HBO show could go the way of “ Star Wars , ” Harry Potter and Disney ’ s Marvelverse .

 When “ Game of Thrones ” finally wrap up on May 19 , at least one of the story ’ s central figure would like the end to be the actual end .
 “ Why [ expletive ] with it ? ” Emilia Clarke , the Dragon Queen herself , said recently .
 “ It ’ s a phenomenon that no one ever saw coming , so I completely understand why anyone would be like , let ’ s make 1,500 more since that ’ s a recipe that work , ” she added . “ I just don ’ t think they should . ”
 Pop culture trend and market pressure might ultimately work against her , however , and a prequel pilot is already in the work . So a HBO ’ s biggest ever hit prepares to begin it final season on April 14 , a definitional question hang over it future : Is “ Game of Thrones ” a series ? Or is it a universe ?
 Based on viewing , industry impact and global attention , “ Thrones ” is one of the biggest blockbuster in TV history . But a giant corporation buy one another and plan bottomless new streaming platform in an ever more feverish battle for your eyeball and entertainment dollar , blockbuster are not enough anymore .
 So while there are only six episode remaining in the sprawling saga of Jon Snow , Daenerys Targaryen , Tyrion and friend , we ’ ve likely only begun exploring Westeros .
 Consider “ Star Wars. ” Since Disney bought Lucasfilm in 2012 for $ 4 billion , it ha strip-mined the franchise , conceiving multiple movie trilogy , stand-alone film and TV series , a well a an enormous presence in Disney ’ s theme park . ( Next up for the “ Thrones ” creator David Benioff and D.B . Weiss : A series of “ Star Wars ” film . )
 Or Harry Potter ( like “ Game of Thrones , ” part of the WarnerMedia empire ) , which after the eight film based on the book is now deep into the “ Fantastic Beasts ” prequel series , and also ha tourist attraction all over the world .
 Or the mightiest pop culture universe of all : Disney ’ s Marvel , which later this month will close out the “ Avengers ” filament of the Marvelverse , with “ Avengers : Endgame , ” but in June extend the X-Men branch with “ Dark Phoenix , ” starring Sansa Stark herself , Sophie Turner .
 So wouldn ’ t the phenomenally popular ( and lucrative ) “ Game of Thrones ” be a prime candidate for a similar treatment ?
 The case in favor includes nearly every detail surrounding the show . In February , AT & T received final clearance for it $ 85.4 billion merger with HBO ’ s corporate parent Time Warner , and will launch a WarnerMedia streaming platform to compete with coming service from Disney — which also just closed a $ 71.3 billion deal to buy 21st Century Fox — and Apple , along with the existing stalwart Netflix , Amazon and Hulu .
 The streaming service will draw from Warner ’ s vast collection of film and show from property like Warner Bros. and Turner a well a HBO . HBO Now , the network ’ s current streaming app , is expected to stick around but HBO ’ s original series and other offering will be incorporated into the WarnerMedia service , meaning “ Game of Thrones ” could appear alongside the like of Harry Potter movie , “ Wonder Woman ” and “ Friends . ”
 John Stankey , the AT & T executive put in charge of WarnerMedia , ha said HBO will get a bigger programming budget in order to ramp up production . “ We want to increase our investment in premium content , ” he said last summer on an earnings call . How much , if any , of that content will be “ Thrones ” -related is an open question . ( AT & T declined to comment . ) But the telecom presumably didn ’ t buy Time Warner just to let one of it most valuable piece of intellectual property go dark .
 “ Thrones ” is also already based on a universe , the Song of Ice and Fire series created by George R.R . Martin , that is so dense with history and lore , it could fuel dozen of series and movie .
 “ The universe is too rich not to try , ” said Casey Bloys , HBO ’ s president of programming . “ But on the other hand , I also don ’ t want to do it just to do it . ”
 The prequel pilot , created by Martin and Jane Goldman , will go into production this summer . Set thousand of year before the event of “ Game of Thrones , ” it will explore the history of the White Walkers and the Stark family , and star Naomi Watts and Miranda Richardson , among others . It wa one of multiple prequel concept commissioned by HBO , which hasn ’ t ruled out moving forward with any of the others at some point .
 And starting next year , “ Thrones ” fan — like “ Star Wars , ” Potter and Marvel devotee — will be able to get their fix in the flesh .
 The Game of Thrones Studio Tour , a 110,000-square-foot tourist attraction , is slated to open in spring 2020 in Northern Ireland , where most of the show wa produced . The project , inspired by Warner Bros. ’ s Harry Potter studio tour outside London , will transform the Linen Mill Studios in Banbridge , where part of “ Thrones ” were shot , into an interactive exhibition of the show ’ s set , costume , prop and weapon .
 “ It ’ s going to be an immersive experience where fan will feel like they are inside their favorite set from the show , ” said Jeff Peters , HBO ’ s vice president for licensing and retail .
 Linen Mill Studios will be the first of a many a four former “ Thrones ” filming location in Northern Ireland to be transformed into interactive fan experience — other possibility include the still-standing set for King ’ s Landing , in Belfast , and Castle Black and the Wall , in a quarry outside the city . While there are not currently plan to create similar attraction in the United States , “ it ’ s possible , ” Peters said . “ We get pitched all the time , and we ’ re open to a lot of different opportunity . ”
 It ’ s worth noting that there are some potential obstacle to “ Game of Thrones ” becoming the next “ Star Wars. ” One is the firmly TV-MA tenor of the series — the risqué material precludes youngster from fueling the franchise a actively a they do for others . ( HBO argues that this will keep “ Thrones ” relevant even if it doesn ’ t add more series , a new generation discover the saga . )
 Another is HBO itself . The network became the crown jewel of television through it taste and commitment to quality ( the occasional “ Arli $ $ ” notwithstanding ) . It ’ s known for walking away from numerous pilot that didn ’ t meet it standard , and will only turn the prequel into an actual series if it life up to “ Thrones , ” Bloys said . “ I want to honor the high bar that Dan and David set with the original show , ” he said .
 As a result , it ’ s way too early to even start thinking of “ Thrones ” a a franchise , he added .
 “ To me , franchise denotes multiple film or multiple TV show living at the same time , ” he said . “ Not having even turned a camera on the prequel just yet , it ’ s premature to say at this point , to declare we ’ re going to have multiple series living at once . ”
 AT & T , however , ha shown no sign of being a hands-off or particularly patient owner . The former HBO chief executive Richard Plepler , a responsible a anyone for the network ’ s taste-making reputation , abruptly left the company two day after the Warner purchase received final clearance .
 There are already sign that AT & T plan to treat “ Thrones ” a one more synergistic cog in it corporate machine . Kristian Nairn , who played the fan favorite Hodor , wa tapped to appear this week at an AT & T store in Boston , where customer could also enter a sweepstakes for a seat on a “ Dragon Wagon ” to the season premiere in New York .
 One faction that is not much interested in any new version of “ Game of Thrones ” : the star of “ Game of Thrones . ”
 None of the current “ Thrones ” actor are involved with the pilot or have had any role in it development . The prequel “ came a a shock to all of u , ” Clarke said .
 The general sentiment from Clarke and others about any future “ Thrones ” series amount to basically , I wish them the best , I had the time of my life , but I ’ m out . ( One exception : the ever cagey Varys . “ Never say never , ” said Conleth Hill , who play him . )
 This isn ’ t terribly surprising , given the length and physical demand of “ Game of Thrones ” — and who know which character will survive the final season ? But the ongoing loosening of TV format would seem to open up plenty of opportunity , even for character that get killed off . What “ Thrones ” fan wouldn ’ t want a mini-series or HBO movie depicting prehistory like , say , Robert ’ s Rebellion and the event that turned Jaime Lannister into the Kingslayer ?
 Nikolaj Coster-Waldau , who play Jaime , hope the prequel is “ even more successful than ‘ Game of Thrones , ’ ” he said . But he ’ s not interested in ever returning to Westeros .
 “ You could only set yourself up for disappointment , ” he said . “ It ’ s been an amazing 10 year , but 10 year is a fair amount of time . ”
 Don ’ t count on a Sansa mini-series either . “ I never want to be in a corset ever again , ” Turner said .
 That said , there could be other opportunity for “ Thrones ” veteran if the show expands into the next great franchise . Its star might be at the pinnacle of the pop culture universe now , a the final season draw near , but some have been around long enough to know how quickly such thing can change .
 “ The cast member that now are so confident about the future , ” Coster-Waldau said . “ Five year from now we will all be guide at the Game of Thrones Land . ”

 Q & A
 Capt . Kate McCue became the first American woman to captain a cruise ship in 2015 . She will soon be at the helm of the Celebrity Edge .
 By Tariro Mzezewa
 “ This is Captain Kate , but you can call me Captain because it took me 19 year to earn this title . ”
 Those are typically the first word that passenger hear booming over the speaker when they are aboard any cruise ship helmed by Capt . Kate McCue . The announcement continues , like the woman who make it , friendly and lighthearted , but also sharp and direct .
 “ People don ’ t have a tendency to call men captain by their first name , ” Captain McCue said on a recent phone call from her home in Las Vegas .
 Captain McCue became the first American woman to captain a cruise ship in 2015 , and command the Celebrity Equinox — a 122,000-ton , 1041-foot ship in the Celebrity Cruises fleet . Starting in September she will be at the helm of the Celebrity Edge , a billion-dollar ship that wa designed by woman and overseen by Lisa Lutoff-Perlo , Celebrity Cruises ’ chief executive .
 My interest in sailing started when I wa 12 . I went on a four-day cruise with my parent and brother over Thanksgiving . When we got back , I told my dad that I wa going to work on cruise ship . I wanted to be the cruise director . My dad said I could be a cruise director or a captain or whatever I wanted .
 It depends on the country you come from . Being American , I could have gone through an academy , which is what I did , or I could have started sailing without a license and then put in the time at sea and taken the exam when I could . The academy wa a lot more organized and structured with schooling and exam a part of the curriculum . I also could have gone the military route and joined the Navy .
 As a cadet I worked on banana boat , taking boat between California and Ecuador . I wa unhappy doing [ this ] because I knew I wanted to be on a cruise ship . I applied to every cruise ship and didn ’ t hear back from anyone . I ended up applying to Disney a a bartender and wa too qualified for that , probably because I had never been a bartender before , so they passed my C.V. along and I wa hired a a third mate on a Disney cruise . That wa great , but Disney only had two ship and not much room for growth . From 2003 to 2015 I worked my way up , from the entry level position of second officer , progressing through first officer deck , first officer navigation , first officer safety , chief officer safety and staff captain .
 I don ’ t have war story . I know that ’ s not the case for everyone , but I ’ ve been really blessed in my career . I have only worked on international flagship where everyone is a minority of some sort . Most of u have a different religion , sexual orientation , nationality . When I wa promoted I never got negative judgment from the crew , and I think the secret is that I wa always surrounded by diversity .
 There used to be the wrath of the captain . Those captain were older , stricter men and they ran the ship very differently . I ’ m part of a generation called the new age captain . We ’ re in our late 30 and early 40 . There ’ s an interesting gap between the captain who are retiring and the younger people replacing them . I love my job so much I ’ m not going anywhere for another 40 year , God willing .
 I wanted to be part of Edge because since joining Celebrity Cruises in 2015 , I ’ d heard about this incredible ship that will change the way we see cruising and evolve the industry . I love change and wanted to be part of a something that wa bringing such innovation and a new level to the cruising industry . Everything about this ship is revolutionary . It is the first ship to be designed using a 3-D virtual-reality lab .
 The “ Christopher Columbus ” dial is no longer . People expect to see that , but on new ship what you see is a wheel smaller than the wheel in your car . On one ship we brought the big wheel from a show and would have people and have them steer . It wa a fantastic prop .
 Bug Naked come when I ’ m the captain , not when I ’ m a guest on a trip . She ’ s got her routine on the ship and I ’ ve got mine . The guest love having her .
 This interview took place in December , following the Edge ’ s first trip with passenger . It ha been condensed and edited .

 The federal government on Tuesday lost it second court challenge to AT & T ’ s $ 85.4 billion merger with Time Warner , a blockbuster deal that ha already begun to reshape much of the medium industry .
 A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected the government ’ s claim that a lower court had applied antitrust law incorrectly in allowing the merger to proceed . Justice Department lawyer have argued that the combination of the two company would reduce competition and hurt consumer .
 “ The government ’ s objection that the District Court misunderstood and misapplied economic principle and clearly erred in rejecting the quantitative model are unpersuasive , ” Judge Judith W. Rogers wrote on behalf of the panel .
 The Justice Department doe not plan another appeal , a spokesman for the agency , Jeremy Edwards , said . “ We are grateful that the Court of Appeals considered our objection , ” he said .
 AT & T can now proceed with it plan to transform WarnerMedia into a streaming-video business in it version of the television industry ’ s go-to strategy . The company ha said it would unveil several online video product by early next year , with the premium cable channel HBO anchoring a service that would feature film and television show from the Warner Bros. library . ( HBO will continue to be available a a stand-alone service . )
 That mean blockbuster movie like “ Wonder Woman ” and installment of the Harry Potter franchise could show up on the service next to TV show like “ Friends ” and HBO hit like “ Game of Thrones. ” AT & T also plan to license some of it video property to service like Netflix , a strategy that could undermine it own streaming product since audience would be able to watch it show and movie elsewhere .
 The appeal court ruling wa a blow to the Justice Department and it lead antitrust regulator , Makan Delrahim , a conservative appointed by President Trump . Mr. Delrahim had sought a divestiture of some Time Warner asset a a condition of allowing the deal to go through , but AT & T ’ s chief executive , Randall Stephenson , refused to make such concession .
 In a statement , David McAtee , AT & T ’ s general counsel , welcomed the appeal court ’ s decision , which followed a lower-court ruling last June .
 “ The merger of these innovative company ha already yielded significant consumer benefit , and it will continue to do so for year to come , ” Mr. McAtee said . “ While we respect the important role that the U.S. Department of Justice play in the merger review process , we trust that today ’ s unanimous decision from the D.C . Circuit will end this litigation . ”
 By challenging the transaction in court , the Justice Department signaled that it would have an aggressive approach to so-called vertical merger between company with complementary business .
 In the case of AT & T and Time Warner , which ha been renamed WarnerMedia , the wireless provider is considered a content distributor and the medium business a content supplier . AT & T said that because the company did not compete , the merger would yield benefit for customer like lower bill and new show tailored for mobile device .
 The deal brought together one of the nation ’ s largest wireless provider with a vast medium business that includes CNN in addition to HBO and Warner Bros. AT & T ha over 153 million wireless subscriber and also owns the satellite TV service DirecTV .
 AT & T ha been operating WarnerMedia a a separate group , making it easier to unwind the business if the Justice Department prevailed in court . The group will continue to operate a a separate division , but AT & T can now integrate it more deeply with the parent company . That will give AT & T executive direct control over Turner Broadcasting , which the Justice Department sought to force the company to sell a a condition of the deal .
 AT & T had agreed to take a hands-off approach to Turner during the appeal , but it can now make staff change at the unit and take the lead in negotiating licensing deal with cable operator like Comcast or Charter . Turner includes CNN and the cable network TNT and TBS , which own right to broadcast game of major sport league like Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association .
 The merger attracted a significant amount of political interest . As a presidential candidate , Donald J. Trump , who ha frequently criticized CNN a “ fake news , ” vowed to block the deal if he wa elected “ because it ’ s too much concentration of power in the hand of too few . ”
 The Justice Department ha insisted that political consideration played no role in the decision to fight it .
 William P. Barr , who wa confirmed a attorney general this month , wa a member of the Time Warner board until June . He told senator at his confirmation hearing that he would recuse himself from the agency ’ s effort to dismantle the merger . Mr. Barr held more than $ 4.2 million worth of Time Warner stock at the end of March and sold his share sometime before the end of June .
 The lower court ’ s approval of Time Warner ’ s merger with AT & T touched off an intense round of deal making . Comcast and the Walt Disney Company clashed in a fiercely contested bidding war for the bulk of 21st Century Fox , the medium empire created by Rupert Murdoch .
 Disney eventually won , securing the right to Mr. Murdoch ’ s film studio , including 20th Century Fox , and several of his cable network . Comcast , which owns NBCUniversal , separately won a bid for the British satellite broadcaster Sky , which the Murdoch family had controlled . ( Mr. Murdoch will continue to control Fox News and Fox broadcasting , a well a the sport network FS1 and the business network Fox Business . ) CBS and Viacom , both controlled by the Redstone family , could pursue a merger this year .
 The government ’ s approach to the AT & T-Time Warner merger contrast sharply with it relatively quick approval of Disney ’ s acquisition of 21st Century Fox ’ s entertainment property . That agreement , which called for Disney to pay $ 71.3 billion for Fox ’ s television and movie business , wa approved in June , about six month after it wa announced . Transactions of such size typically take a year or more .
 After AT & T closed the deal with Time Warner in June , it quickly appointed an executive to oversee the new acquisition . The move led some people to worry that the company would foist it mechanized method onto Time Warner . But AT & T ha said it plan to preserve the entertainment giant ’ s culture of talent and creativity .
 AT & T also ha to prove to it investor that it can pay off it staggering debt load of $ 171 billion , much more than most public company carry . The company borrowed $ 40 billion to finance the Time Warner acquisition . Mr. Stephenson ha said AT & T should be able to pay off about $ 30 billion of it debt this year .
 The wireless industry continues to face substantial challenge . The nation ’ s four major carrier — AT & T , Verizon , T-Mobile and Sprint — have been locked in a price war for several year . Most people in the country already pay for mobile service , and the carrier have had to lower their price to steal customer away from one another . That ha reduced profit , prompting new strategy .
 AT & T bought Time Warner in a bid to hold on to customer by offering added product like HBO and other video service , either at discounted rate or a part of a package .
 Verizon ha taken a different tack . By investing more heavily in the next-generation cellular technology known a 5G , the company hope to beat it rival in offering customer faster internet speed . The technology could eventually replace the broadband service now sold by cable provider . T-Mobile and Sprint are seeking approval for a merger that would create a bigger company able to supercharge it own investment in 5G technology .

 The producer of the Fox drama “ Empire ” announced Friday that Jussie Smollett ’ s character would not appear in the final two episode of the show ’ s fifth season . The announcement came a day after Chicago police arrested him and said he staged an attack against himself in a bid for publicity .
 Following his arrest and release on bail , Mr. Smollett had returned to the set of “ Empire ” and started filming scene a his character Jamal Lyon , raising question of how Fox would handle his presence going forward .
 [ Latest update — For Jussie Smollett , how a life of art and activism is upended . ]
 “ While these allegation are very disturbing , we are placing our trust in the legal system a the process play out , ” the producer said in a statement . “ We are also aware of the effect of this process on the cast and crew member who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set , we have decided to remove the role of ‘ Jamal ’ from the final two episode of the season . ”
 Mr. Smollett ’ s arrest — and his recent loss of support from many public figure who spoke out in favor of him after the attack last month — put Fox in an extremely awkward position .
 [ Read more about his arrest on Thursday . ]
 There are two more episode left to shoot over the next month for the show ’ s fifth season . Fox ha been a staunch supporter of Mr. Smollett ’ s for week , releasing a statement a recently a Wednesday saying that he wa the “ consummate professional ” and denying he would be written out of the show . Likewise in their statement on Friday , the producer said , “ Jussie ha been an important member of our ‘ Empire ’ family for the past five year and we care about him deeply . ”
 But with Mr. Smollett ’ s arrest — and the Chicago police claiming they have key evidence to demonstrate he staged the attack — the “ Empire ” set wa on the verge of turning into a circus . After Mr. Smollett posted bail , he wa trailed by news helicopter a he returned to the “ Empire ” set . He did not return to the “ Empire ” set on Friday .
 The move to cut him out of the final two episode this season essentially buy Fox and producer of “ Empire ” some time to decide what to ultimately do with his character .
 Fox ha until mid-May to decide if it even want to keep “ Empire ” on the air , though there are reason to do that . The show is it second-highest-rated drama and it ha a shrinking but passionate fan base .
 If the series is renewed , Fox ha until the end of June to decide if it want to pick up actor ’ contract , which would include Mr. Smollett ’ s . Filming would not begin again until later in July or August .
 There are several corporate change that may determine Mr. Smollett ’ s fate a well .
 In a matter of week , 20th Century Fox Television , the studio that produce “ Empire , ” will be folded into The Walt Disney Company after Disney close on it purchase of many of Fox ’ s entertainment property . Suddenly Disney ’ s opinion of Mr. Smollett will become a vital part of the calculus .
 Likewise , the Fox broadcast network , which is not part of the sale and will still be owned by the Murdoch family , ha a new set of leader that will guide a different path for the network . It will be up to those leader , led by the Fox Entertainment chief executive Charlie Collier , to decide whether they want “ Empire ” on the air and if they want to include Mr. Smollett .
 Mr. Smollett play Jamal Lyon , the gay scion of a hip-hop dynasty . The character is a fan favorite and Danny Strong , a producer for the show , tweeted a recently a a week ago that Mr. Smollett is the “ third lead ” of the series . Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson are the star of the show .
 “ Empire ” wa last on the air in December , and is scheduled to return to Fox ’ s airwave on March 13 . This season ha nine more episode and Mr. Smollett will appear in most of them ; seven of the nine episode have already been shot .
 A big question for Fox ’ s producer will be how Mr. Smollett is written off the final two episode this season , and how they will approach his character if it ’ s decided he should leave the show for good . When Jamal Lyon wa last seen , he wa fighting with his fiancé who , in turn , wa threatening to move to London . One solution for the show ’ s creator could be to have Jamal join his fiancé in Britain .
 Or perhaps the producer could go a more tried-and-true route .
 “ The easiest way is that they write him to die or they languish him to the hospital for some time , hoping people will forget them , ” said Linda Seger , a veteran script consultant .
 The producer who announced that Mr. Smollett would be removed from the final two episode this season include Lee Daniels , Mr. Strong , Brett Mahoney , Brian Grazer , Sanaa Hamri , Francie Calfo and Dennis Hammer .
 There is plenty of recent precedent of producer removing actor from TV series when real-life event force their hand . Charlie Sheen wa fired from the CBS sitcom “ Two and a Half Men ” in 2011 and replaced after several episode of bizarre and bad behavior . Kevin Spacey wa fired from “ House of Cards ” after he wa accused of sexual misconduct in 2017 . And ABC spun-off “ Roseanne ” into a new comedy , “ The Conners , ” after Roseanne Barr posted a racist tweet last year .

 Good Wednesday . ( Want this by email ? Sign up here . )
 A new research paper tracked the political donation of thousand of C.E.O.s from 2000 through 2017 . The result , Andrew writes in his latest column , reveal what top business leader really think about politics .
 They ’ re usually Republican . Nearly 58 percent of C.E.O.s showed a preference for the G.O.P. , with just 18 percent designated a Democrats . ( For executive to be counted a either , two third of their donation had to go to candidate affiliated with one party . )
 About a quarter were considered neutral . The report doesn ’ t disclose who wa in each category , but it author told Andrew that Tim Cook of Apple wa neutral , having donated to both Hillary Clinton and Paul Ryan over the year .
 The disparity wa narrower in some sector . Tech and internet company had somewhat more Democratic-leaning C.E.O.s . And female leader were nearly evenly split between the G.O.P. , Democrats and neutral territory .
 But the Republicans are quieter . The study found that there wa a statistically significant association between a company having a Republican C.E.O . and le disclosure of political contribution .
 Why it matter : “ The opinion held by executive have always resonated beyond their own industry , but their importance is more pronounced today , ” Andrew writes . “ Mr . Trump , for example , ha not hesitated to equate economic policy with foreign policy . It is , then , instructive to understand the political view of our business leader . ”
 The U.S. and China will embark on another round of high-level trade talk in a final attempt to hash out an agreement , according to the WSJ .
 • “ U.S . Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin plan to fly to Beijing next week to meet with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He , Trump administration official said . ”
 • “ The following week , a Chinese delegation led by Mr. Liu is expected to continue talk in Washington . ”
 There are conflicting view on how far they ’ ve got :
 America seems upbeat . President Trump yesterday said that talk were “ going very well , ” and Myron Brilliant , executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , said that “ we ’ re in the endgame . ”
 But China may be wary . “ Some U.S. negotiator are concerned that China is pushing back against American demand in trade talk , ” Bloomberg report , citing unnamed source . It may walk back some promise because they didn ’ t prompt assurance about American concession .
 A deal could be ready by the end of April if the next talk go well , the WSJ estimate , about a month later than previously expected .
 Meanwhile , in Europe : President Xi Jinping ’ s trip to Italy and France this week is drawing attention to Europe ’ s conflicted view on China .
 After year of criticism , Facebook said it would no longer permit advertiser in key category to show their message only to people of a certain race , gender or age group , Noam Scheiber and Mike Isaac of the NYT report .
 • Anyone advertising housing , job or credit would no longer have the option of explicitly aiming ad on the basis of those characteristic .
 • The new rule also cover advertising on Instagram and Messenger , which Facebook owns .
 • Facebook said it planned to carry out the change by the end of the year .
 • The change are part of a settlement with group that have sued Facebook over these practice in recent year .
 The shift will annoy advertiser . Sheryl Sandberg , Facebook ’ s C.O.O. , told the NYT that the change could make advertising on Facebook le efficient for some customer , but that it wa “ a cost well worth bearing . ”
 And it ha limit . “ I don ’ t think it solves the problem of the potential for biased serving of ad , ” Pauline Kim , a professor of employment law at Washington University in St. Louis , told the NYT . She explained that Facebook ’ s algorithm could show any ad to a particular audience if that audience were determined to be likelier to click on it .
 More Facebook news : Representative David Cicilline , the head of the House antitrust subcommittee , explains why he is calling on the F.T.C . to investigate the company . And are we asking it the wrong question in the wake of the Christchurch shooting ?
 In the wake of two fatal crash involving Boeing ’ s 737 Max 8 plane , a new focus for investigation is how the F.A.A . certified the jet a safe , David Gelles and Tom Kaplan of the NYT report .
 • “ The 737 Max wa one of the first commercial jet approved under new rule , which delegated more authority to Boeing than had been the case when most previous plane were certified . ”
 • “ Top F.A.A . official , who are briefed on significant safety issue , were not aware ” of an automated piloting system suspected in the crash , Mr. Gelles and Mr. Kaplan report , citing unnamed source .
 • “ The software did not elicit what are known a special condition , usually applied to a novel feature that requires additional regulation before it can be certified a safe. ” But other feature , like non-rechargeable lithium battery , received that designation .
 • Skepticism about the F.A.A. ’ s approval process existed before the crash . “ In 2012 , an investigation by the Transportation Department ’ s Office of Inspector General found that F.A.A . manager had not always been supportive of effort by agency employee to ‘ hold Boeing accountable . ’ ”
 • “ The United States transportation secretary , Elaine L. Chao , on Tuesday called for her agency ’ s internal watchdog to open an inquiry into the process . ”
 More aviation news : President Trump nominated Stephen Dickson , a former Delta Air Lines executive , to lead the F.A.A . And an off-duty pilot reportedly helped save a Lion Air 737 Max 8 flight in software-driven trouble just one day before the same jet crashed .
 The tech giant introduced a service yesterday that allows people to play high-definition game instantly over the internet . It ’ s hoping to lead a revolution in the $ 135 billion industry .
 Think of it a Netflix for video game . “ The new service , called Stadia , will work for anyone with a fast internet connection and a computer , phone or tablet , ” Daisuke Wakabayashi and Brian Chen of the NYT write . “ Users pay a subscription to access a library of game that they can immediately play , a opposed to the traditional model of paying for a disc or waiting to download a game . ”
 This isn ’ t the only game-streaming option . Sony offer one called PlayStation Now , and Microsoft plan to test something similar this year . The idea hasn ’ t yet hit the mainstream because streaming game is more technically demanding than streaming movie — and therefore prone to glitch .
 Plenty of unanswered question hang over the announcement . What game will be available ? How much will the service cost ? And more fundamentally , what is Google ’ s business model ? None of that is clear .
 But Google ha not-so-secret weapon . “ Using the global network of data center that run it internet empire , it is set to unleash enough raw computing power to blow away the industry ’ s current way of doing thing , ” the FT writes , and it ha “ YouTube a a shop window. ” Shares in Sony and Nintendo tumbled after the announcement .
 More Google news : In Europe , the company is changing how it display some search result , and is giving Android user a choice of web browser to stave off complaint — and potential fine — from antitrust regulator .
 Just after midnight Eastern Time , Walt Disney closed it $ 71.3 billion takeover of 21st Century Fox . It ha become , Brooks Barnes of the NYT writes , “ an entertainment colossus the size of which the world ha never seen . ”
 Disney now owns an enviable array of asset . It already run blockbuster property like Marvel , Lucasfilm and ESPN , and a huge global theme-park operation . But buying most of Rupert Murdoch ’ s medium empire brings :
 • The 20th Century Fox movie and TV studio , home to “ X-Men ” and “ The Simpsons ”
 • The Nat Geo and FX cable channel
 • Most of the Hulu streaming service
 • Star , the fast-growing Indian video provider
 The consequence could be huge . Smaller studio may have to merge . Theater owner could lose out on box-office split . And Disney ’ s effort to dominate streaming could pose big challenge to Netflix , Amazon and Apple .
 But the stake are high . “ Mr . Iger and his lieutenant need to persuade investor to start viewing Disney more like a technology company , where near-term financial turbulence is often overlooked , ” Mr. Barnes writes . And melding two corporate culture isn ’ t easy .
 Anheuser-Busch InBev named Marty Barrington , the former C.E.O . of Altria , a it new chairman . Alex Behring , the head of the investment firm 3G Capital , stepped down from the board .
 Paul Ryan , the former House speaker , ha joined the board of Fox .
 WarnerMedia named Toby Emmerich , Peter Roth and Kimberly Williams a interim co-heads of Warner Bros. while it seek a replacement for Kevin Tsujihara .
 Kickstarter ’ s co-founder Perry Chen is stepping down a C.E.O .

 Viacom , the once mighty cable giant behind pop culture confection like “ Jersey Shore ” and child ’ s fare like “ Dora the Explorer , ” is acquiring the streaming service PlutoTV for $ 340 million , the company said in an announcement on Tuesday .
 This is Viacom ’ s most significant move into streaming , now the go-to strategy for medium company a more and more viewer forgo traditional cable subscription . The emergence of streaming service like Netflix and Hulu ha hastened the decline of the pay TV business and ha upended the medium universe .
 Time Warner , once the largest medium business in the country , sold itself to AT & T in an $ 85.4 billion deal last year , and Rupert Murdoch , who had built a giant entertainment conglomerate over decade , is selling the bulk of his empire to the Walt Disney Company for $ 71.3 billion after a bitter bidding war against Comcast . The impetus for both deal wa to create entity capable of taking on Netflix and other tech company by offering their own streaming plan . AT & T and Disney will unveil their service by the end of the year .
 Viacom ’ s deal for PlutoTV , while much smaller , share some of that motivation . PlutoTV , founded in 2013 and led by Kenneth Parks and Tom Ryan , is a free , advertising-based service and ha about 12 million active viewer a month . NBCUniversal also announced this month that it would start a streaming service largely supported by advertising .
 PlutoTV run show from Discovery , Viacom ’ s AwesomenessTV and news content from several broadcast network , including NBC and CBS . The start-up split ad revenue with the network . Mr. Ryan will remain chief executive and report to Viacom ’ s management team . Mr . Parks , who previously wa one of the leading executive at Spotify , will step down a chairman . The business publication The Information earlier reported on the acquisition talk .
 Viacom ’ s chief executive , Robert M. Bakish , ha been working on an extended turnaround of the ailing medium company , which count MTV , Nickelodeon and the Paramount film studio in it portfolio . The cable network have faltered a younger audience have turned to platform like YouTube and Facebook . Paramount ha found some box office success under it new chief , Jim Gianopulos , with film like “ A Quiet Place ” and “ Mission : Impossible — Fallout . ”
 The company ha also rebooted it TV production business to take advantage of the growing appetite for more content a Netflix , Hulu , Amazon and Apple spend big on original series . The company produced “ 13 Reasons Why ” for Netflix and “ Tom Clancy ’ s Jack Ryan ” for Amazon , helping it add $ 400 million in revenue last year .
 Shari Redstone , who is Viacom ’ s controlling shareholder , ha in the past agitated for a merger with CBS , also under her control . CBS ha undergone a reckoning in the wake of the # MeToo movement , including the ouster of it longtime chief executive , Leslie Moonves . The company ’ s board is searching for his replacement .

 On Thursday morning , Jussie Smollett wa arrested by the Chicago police and prompted a denunciation from President Trump .
 By late Thursday afternoon , Mr. Smollett wa back at work on “ Empire , ” according to a person involved with the Fox series who spoke on condition of anonymity to discus personnel move .
 The Chicago Police Department ’ s arrest of the “ Empire ” actor , and his subsequent return to work , could have been taken straight from an episode of the show , which ha had plot line involving murder , kidnapping , car bomb , coma and memory loss .
 [ Latest update — For Jussie Smollett , how a life of art and activism is upended . ]
 Instead , the latest bizarre twist in a case in which Mr. Smollett wa charged with orchestrating and staging an assault on himself will prompt a series of awkward decision for Fox , including determining the fate of “ Empire , ” which , a of a month ago , wa a fading but still respectable hit for the network .
 The question Fox must now wrestle with include deciding what to do about Mr. Smollett ’ s character and weighing the potential blowback if they keep him on the show . There are still two episode left to be shot over the next month for the show ’ s fifth season , according to the person involved with the show . When Mr. Smollett returned to work on Thursday he wa prepared to film scene from the season ’ s second-to-last episode , the person said . It is still an open question whether Fox will use the footage when the episode ultimately air .
 “ Empire ” ha not yet been renewed for a sixth season , so it ultimate fate still hang in the balance .
 For four year , Mr. Smollett ha played Jamal Lyon , the openly gay middle child of a hip-hop dynasty . Though the show is far from the monster hit it wa when it made it debut in 2015 , it still draw 7.1 million viewer a week and Mr. Smollett ’ s character ha been a fan favorite . “ Empire ” is also one of Fox ’ s highest rated show and is in 10th place among all network entertainment show , on par with ABC ’ s “ The Bachelor , ” according to Nielsen .
 As recently a Wednesday , Fox had praised Mr. Smollett a a “ consummate professional ” and insisted he wa not being written off the show . But the network wa more muted on Thursday .
 “ We understand the seriousness of this matter and we respect the legal process , ” Fox said in a statement after the arrest . “ We are evaluating the situation and we are considering our option . ”
 The Chicago police superintendent Eddie T. Johnson said that Mr. Smollett staged the assault last month to create publicity because he wa dissatisfied with his salary . In the most recent season of “ Empire , ” Mr. Smollett reportedly earned between $ 65,000 and $ 100,000 an episode . “ Empire ” make 18 episode a season and Mr. Smollett had not previously raised objection to Fox regarding his salary , according to three people familiar with the show ’ s finance .
 Mr. Smollett is not the biggest star on “ Empire ” — the show ’ s lead are Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson — but he remains vital to it success .
 “ He is the third lead and one of the most beloved character on the show , ” the “ Empire ” co-creator Danny Strong tweeted last week . “ Writing him off the show ha NEVER even been discussed . ”
 The producer of the series could avoid making a final decision about the fate of Mr. Smollett ’ s character for a few month . Fox will have until mid-May to assemble it fall schedule , which give the network nearly three month to renew or cancel “ Empire. ” If the show is renewed , executive do not have to pick up option for actor ’ contract until the end of June and filming would probably begin again in late July .
 Complicating matter is the fact that 20th Century Fox Television — the studio that produce “ Empire ” — is week away from being folded into the Walt Disney Company after Disney ’ s deal to purchase many of Fox ’ s entertainment asset finally close . How Disney feel about Mr. Smollett will become a more urgent question in the week ahead .
 Once the Fox broadcast network is separated from the television studio that produce the series , the future of “ Empire ” will ultimately be left to Fox ’ s new chief executive of entertainment , Charlie Collier .
 If Mr. Smollett is written off the series , it will not be the first time that real-world action have forced the hand of a TV show ’ s creative team .
 When ABC canceled “ Roseanne ” last year — after a racist tweet by the show ’ s star , Roseanne Barr — it made the decision to spin off the series without her . Writers and producer of the spinoff , “ The Conners , ” had to confront how to remove Ms. Barr ’ s character from the series in a way that wasn ’ t too sympathetic . Ultimately , the character died from an opioid overdose , and critic have mostly praised “ The Conners . ”
 “ Writers are experienced with device that get rid of a character either for a little while or a long time , ” said Martin Kaplan , director of the Norman Lear Center for medium and society at the University of Southern California . “ Anything from a tragic car accident to ‘ he took a walk in the wood and no one know where he is . ’ ”
 Charlie Sheen wa fired from the hit CBS sitcom “ Two and a Half Men ” in 2011 following several episode of bad behavior . Mr. Sheen ’ s character wa hit by a train and Ashton Kutcher joined the cast . The series lasted for four more season .
 Producers for “ House of Cards ” fired it star , Kevin Spacey , after he wa accused of sexual misconduct in 2017 . His character wa killed off by a medication overdose and the show had one final season on Netflix without him . The 1980s sitcom “ Valerie ” eventually became “ The Hogan Family ” after the show ’ s star , Valerie Harper , wa fired because of a salary dispute . Her character wa killed off in a car accident .

 Good morning .
 ( Here ’ s the sign-up , if you don ’ t already get California Today by email . )
 If you ’ ve been following the college admission scandal , you ’ ll recall that one of the alleged scheme carried out by William Singer , the figure at the center of the investigation , and the parent he worked for , wa faking standardized test result .
 But if you ’ ve ever taken a college-entrance exam — with all the attendant security precaution — you may be wondering how that would actually work . My colleague , Jennifer Medina , recently went to a West Hollywood school to find out :
 On an early morning in June 2017 a teenage girl got on a plane in San Jose and flew to Los Angeles , arriving at a testing center in West Hollywood to take a college-entrance exam .
 Her parent , Elizabeth and Manuel Henriquez , a Silicon Valley hedge fund manager , had handpicked the testing site .
 While most student take their entrance exam at large public high school near their home , the Henriquezes chose a private institution , the West Hollywood College Preparatory School .
 It wa one of two testing site where Mr. Singer cultivated relationship with test administrator who would accept bribe , according to court document . For $ 10,000 per test , and sometimes more , the document say , Igor Dvorskiy ensured that student could be given answer from the proctor .
 Federal prosecutor say that ’ s what happened when the Henriquezes ’ daughter arrived .
 On a visit this week , nothing at the school suggested it wa the site of one of the biggest testing scandal in decade . It is tucked inside a small building of a large old synagogue . The entrance to the school is a solitary white door with a small blue sign emblazoned with it name .
 The school ’ s website describes it a offering a “ ‘ cradle-to-college ’ education by providing a family-like nurturing academic environment with small class sizes. ” Mr. Dvorskiy is listed a the director of the school .
 The court document make clear that federal investigator closely monitored the school for several month , tracking Ms. Dvorskiy on the day of the college entrance exam with Mr. Singer ’ s client .
 Typically , Mr. Singer would tell his client “ fabricate a reason — such a a bar mitzvah or a wedding — that their child purportedly needed to take the test in Houston or West Hollywood instead of at their own school , ” according to court document .
 “ The extent of the fraud that took place at this testing center should be a major red flag to the College Board , ” said Alexis Redding , a visiting scholar at the Harvard Graduate School of Education who ha studied college admission . “ There ha always been tremendous variability in the quality and professionalism of testing site and that open the door for cheating to occur . Students tend to know which site have inattentive proctor or lax policy . ”

 Netflix is raising price .
 Given how much it ha been spending on content , the move isn ’ t surprising , but the latest jump — anywhere from 13 to 18 percent depending on the subscription plan — is the biggest increase since Netflix started it streaming service a dozen year ago . That ’ s going to hurt some consumer .
 Many of it user pay for the service even if they don ’ t consistently watch it content , partly because of it attractive pricing . A bare-bones subscription , for instance , had cost $ 8 a month . But fee increase at Netflix are inevitable . One of reason : Netflix burn a lot of cash .
 The company ’ s appetite for content mean it ha to spend big , resulting in what ’ s known a negative free cash flow . More money is going out the door than coming in , a difference that Netflix cover by borrowing even more .
 “ We change pricing from time to time a we continue investing in great entertainment and improving the overall Netflix experience , ” the company said in a statement announcing the change , which apply just to United States customer .
 Netflix ’ s most popular plan , which give a customer two simultaneous stream , will get the largest increase , to $ 13 a month from $ 11 . Still , it ’ s cheaper than HBO , whose streaming service cost about $ 15 a month . The $ 8 a month plan will now cost $ 9 , and the high-end version , which allows for four simultaneous stream , jump to $ 16 from $ 14 . ( The new price took effect Tuesday for new subscriber . For existing customer , the increase will start in about three month . )
 Netflix , which will report quarterly earnings on Thursday , ha committed to spending over $ 18.6 billion on content . That ’ s for show and film that won ’ t appear on the service for month , whether it ’ s the next season of “ Stranger Things ” or the forthcoming lineup from the super producer Shonda Rhimes .
 It also includes content that ’ s currently playing , like “ Friends , ” which ran on NBC from 1994 through 2004 and is owned by AT & T ’ s WarnerMedia . The show is wildly popular on the service . Worries that it would leave Netflix prompted an outcry on social medium . “ The only reason I have an account with Netflix is to rewatch ‘ Friends , ’ ” one customer said .
 That help to explain why Netflix agreed to pay AT & T approximately $ 100 million to keep the show through this year , a threefold increase from what it had been paying on average .
 Original show owned by Netflix are also expensive . “ Stranger Things , ” whose new season will become available this summer , cost a much a $ 8 million per episode . Netflix ha to pay for all of that up front .
 Multiply that by the hundred of hour of original content that Netflix produce every year , and the cash start to bleed out . The company had negative free cash flow of $ 2 billion last year . It expects that figure to rise to about $ 3 billion this year and about the same next year . That ha added to the company ’ s debt : up to $ 12 billion before it proposed borrowing another $ 2 billion in October through a bond offering .
 Spending big on content while keeping price modest ha helped Netflix expand it customer base , about 58 million in the United States and 130 million worldwide . Those figure will be updated Thursday a part of it earnings report .
 But Netflix technically isn ’ t losing any money . In fact , it claim a profit every quarter since accounting rule allow entertainment company to record most of their production or licensing cost later on .
 The stake for owning content have risen . Big-pocketed player like the Walt Disney Company , AT & T and NBCUniversal plan to compete with Netflix with streaming service of their own . Both Disney and AT & T ’ s WarnerMedia plan to unveil their product by the end of the year , and NBCUniversal , owned by Comcast , is working on an ad-supported model streaming service that it plan to make available in early 2020 .
 Not to be left out , Amazon offer a streaming service a part of it Prime shipping program for $ 13 a month , or $ 120 a year . Hulu sell an ad-free service for $ 12 per month . ( Disney will take control of Hulu once it completes it acquisition of the bulk of Rupert Murdoch ’ s Fox business , sometime around the middle of the year . )
 There is also Apple , which ha spent well over $ 1 billion to create original TV show . The boom in streaming ha increased cost throughout Hollywood , where competition for talent and property ha intensified .
 As Netflix ’ s chief executive , Reed Hastings , said in October : “ There ’ s never been so much TV and movie being created around the world . So the game is on . ”

 Part 3 : The New Fox Weapon The Disney deal left the Murdochs with a medium empire stripped to it essence : a hard-core right-wing news machine — with Lachlan in charge .
 By JONATHAN MAHLER and JIM RUTENBERG APRIL 3 , 2019
 This is Part 3 of a three-part story . Go back and read Part 1 and Part 2 .
 It wa in the midst of this moment — the biggest deal of his career — that the 86-year-old Murdoch tripped on his way to the bathroom on Lachlan ’ s yacht and had to be transported to Los Angeles . With their father laid up at the Ronald Reagan U.C.L.A . Medical Center at the start of 2018 , Murdoch ’ s child descended on Los Angeles , unsure if this would be the end . Lachlan and his wife , Sarah , met them at the hospital . Elisabeth and her husband , Keith Tyson , came from London , James and Kathryn from New York . Murdoch ’ s surgery wa successful . Not long after his child arrived , his condition stabilized . Following his near-death experience , Murdoch joked that he did not realize how serious his condition wa until he had seen all his child gathered around his hospital bed .
 Murdoch would be laid up for the next few month but still in command , running thing from his bedroom at Moraga . In an email to his senior management leaked to Vanity Fair ’ s Gabriel Sherman , he described the incident a “ a sailing accident ” and said that he would be working at home for a little while . “ In the meantime , ” Murdoch wrote , “ you ’ ll be hearing from me by email , phone and text ! ”
 The negotiation continued . As they did , Lachlan and James adjusted to their new reality . Unable to secure a job at Disney that he wanted , and wary of it aggressively safe and hierarchical culture , James decided in the winter that he would not try to follow the family ’ s asset to their new home , according to three people who are close to him . Lachlan would take over what wa left of the Murdoch empire without interference from his brother .
 In early June 2018 , before the final term were settled , another bidder emerged . Brian Roberts , the chief executive of Comcast , offered Murdoch $ 65 billion for 21st Century Fox , $ 12.6 billion more than Disney wa prepared to pay . Murdoch didn ’ t want to sell to Comcast , according to three people familiar with his thinking . He preferred Disney for a variety of reason , including his personal admiration for Iger , whom he viewed a a risk-taking leader in his own image . What ’ s more , the Comcast offer wa all cash , which would create a big tax burden for Murdoch . But Murdoch did like the prospect of a bidding war . And he had a potential path to securing both a higher price and his preferred buyer in the Justice Department ’ s ongoing lawsuit to block a proposed merger between AT & T and Time Warner .
 Comcast ’ s interest in 21st Century Fox allowed Murdoch to drive up Disney ’ s purchase price to $ 71.3 billion . Iger and his team delivered what they hoped would be their final offer personally to Murdoch in London , traveling through Ireland because they were worried that Comcast might be tracking the movement of private plane flying in and out of London from the United States . Murdoch had Disney on the hook .
 His back now healed , Murdoch attended the Allen & Company medium conference in Sun Valley , Idaho , in July 2018 . With Roberts and Iger nearby , he seemed exhilarated ; once again , he wa in the middle of the action . The problem for Murdoch wa that if Comcast made another counteroffer , he might have a fiduciary responsibility to present the offer to his board , and it might accept it , absent extenuating circumstance . He didn ’ t want his stalking horse to overtake his favorite .
 [ Read 6 takeaway from this story . ]
 The Trump Justice Department came to Murdoch ’ s rescue , appealing a federal court ruling in the AT & T and Time Warner case . On it face , the lawsuit had nothing to do with Comcast , but because the company had it own history of tangle with government regulator , the appeal would give Murdoch the cover he needed to accept Iger ’ s latest bid : Comcast now looked risky . There is no evidence that the Justice Department factored Murdoch ’ s interest into it decision-making process ; nevertheless , he had gotten another $ 20 billion for his company while still selling to his preferred suitor .
 When the deal wa finalized , Murdoch would personally make roughly $ 4 billion , bringing his net worth to $ 18 billion . All six of his child would receive $ 2 billion each . Lachlan and James would get even more — an additional $ 20 million in Disney stock , plus golden parachute worth about $ 70 million each . Yet neither one wa getting what he had really wanted .
 Media empire are built on the foresight and audacity of their leader , their ability to anticipate and embrace sudden change in an industry that ’ s constantly evolving . But they are also built on something far more mundane : government regulation . More than anything , it ’ s the moving of line , the lifting of cap and the rewriting of rule that enable mogul to transform business into empire . These decision are invariably opaque , the product of a labyrinthine bureaucratic process and the inherently subjective definition of what ’ s in the public interest . Under President Trump , these decision have almost always broken Murdoch ’ s way .
 The Time Warner-AT & T deal wa itself a good example of the ambiguity of this bureaucratic process . It worked out perfectly for Murdoch , but Trump had his own reason to try to block the acquisition : Time Warner wa the owner of CNN , with which he wa constantly feuding . He called it a “ a deal that ’ s not good for the country , ” and privately urged his chief economics adviser , Gary Cohn , to stop it , according to two people who were told about the conversation . ( The exchange wa first reported in The New Yorker . ) Deals like this , a “ vertical merger ” between two company in separate business , rarely face antitrust scrutiny . And yet Trump ’ s Department of Justice sued to prevent it , the first time the federal government had taken such a step in 40 year . The Justice Department antitrust enforcer who filed the government ’ s lawsuit against the deal , Makan Delrahim , wa in fact on record saying earlier that he didn ’ t see it “ a a major antitrust problem. ” And yet when a federal judge , Richard Leon , dismissed the Justice Department ’ s case , calling one of it key argument “ gossamer thin , ” the government appealed , and just in time to stave off Comcast ’ s next bid for 21st Century Fox . The process had dragged on for more than two year .
 The speed with which Murdoch ’ s Disney deal wa approved stood in stark contrast . This type of agreement — a “ horizontal merger ” bringing together Hollywood ’ s largest and third-largest studio — would give the combined company near-monopoly power to raise consumer ’ price and limit their choice . Such deal ordinarily invite strict government scrutiny . The Department of Justice approved it in just six month . ( Fox executive credit the company ’ s thorough preparation for it speedy and successful review . ) After calling Murdoch to ensure that the deal wouldn ’ t affect Fox News , Trump had applauded it : “ This could be a great thing for job , ” his press secretary , Sarah Huckabee Sanders , said when asked to characterize the president ’ s reaction to the agreement . Wall Street analyst predicted that the deal would result in thousand of layoff .
 The ambiguity of the regulatory process were also evident in another deal with major implication for Murdoch ’ s empire . In the spring of 2017 , month before Murdoch started negotiating with Iger , the Sinclair Broadcast Group agreed to buy Tribune Media for $ 3.9 billion . Sinclair wa already the largest owner of local TV station in the country . It wa also overwhelmingly pro-Trump : Its local station , many of which were in key swing state , provided Trump with positive coverage during the campaign — a result , in part , of a deal that Kushner had personally struck with Sinclair ’ s chairman , David Smith . Murdoch had been concerned about the company ’ s steady growth . With Sinclair ’ s acquisition of Tribune , which wa already in 39 percent of American household , the company would now be in more than 70 percent . What ’ s more , Tribune owned WGN , an unremarkable cable channel with unexploited potential : It reached nearly 80 million home and could easily be converted into a right-wing national news network — an instant competitor to Fox News . In conversation with colleague , Murdoch worried that Sinclair might hire O ’ Reilly a the marquee star of the new Fox rival .
 Sinclair seemed to have a friend and ally not just in Trump but also in the Federal Communications Commission ’ s chairman , Ajit Pai . Days after the election , when he wa still just a commissioner at the agency , he appeared at a Sinclair executive retreat at the Four Seasons in Baltimore , according to a Politico story . After he became chairman in 2017 , he effectively enabled Sinclair ’ s bid for the Tribune station , easing limit on how many station a single company could own . There wa enough suspicion that Pai might be inclined to give Sinclair favorable treatment that the F.C.C. ’ s inspector general started an investigation into the commissioner ’ s relationship with the company . But then , in the summer of 2018 , Pai basically blocked the deal , announcing that he had “ serious concern ” about it . Sinclair official said they were “ shocked . ”
 Once again , thing had broken Murdoch ’ s way . The report cleared Pai of inappropriate conduct — either to help or hurt Sinclair — though it left some question unanswered about Fox , like what Pai and Jared Kushner discussed during a conversation just before the deal wa announced . Pai wa asked if anyone from Fox News had tried to influence the ruling . He “ responded in the negative , ” the investigator wrote .
 In the middle of August 2018 , Lachlan Murdoch emerged from his Gulfstream G550 in a T-shirt and jean and climbed into a black Range Rover waiting for him on the tarmac . Australian paparazzo were waiting there , too , a they often were when Lachlan or his father arrived in Sydney . This time , they were both in town : Murdoch had landed two day earlier . They went for a company award dinner , but they had another agenda a well .
 The night after his arrival , Lachlan invited a small group of Sky employee and manager to his $ 16 million mansion in Sydney for drink . With it new prime-time lineup of hard-right opinion host , Sky had become a force in Australian politics . Its audience wa still small by American standard , but it wa the network of choice in the capital , Canberra , and it wa finalizing a deal to expand it reach into the Australian Outback — demographically speaking , the equivalent of Trump country .
 It wa a mirror of Fox News , with it fixation on race , identity and climate-change denial . Night after night , Sky ’ s host and their guest stirred anger over the perceived liberal bias of the medium , “ suicidal self-hatred ” of Western civilization and the Australian equivalent of the Central American “ caravan ” that were dividing the United States : asylum seeker coming to the country by boat from Indonesia and Malaysia , many of them Muslim . Days before Lachlan ’ s arrival , a national neo-Nazi leader , Blair Cottrell — who had recently been fined for “ inciting contempt for Muslims ” — appeared on one of the network ’ s show . Cottrell had been interviewed on Australian TV before , but his deferential treatment by Sky caused a national outcry . Under gentle questioning , he called on his countryman to “ reclaim our traditional identity a Australians ” and advocated limiting immigration to those “ who are not too culturally dissimilar from u , ” such a white South African farmer . ( Sky apologized and suspended the program . )
 Inside Lachlan ’ s living room , the talk turned to national politics . “ Do you think Malcolm is going to survive ? ” Lachlan asked his staff . Malcolm wa Malcolm Turnbull , the relatively moderate Australian prime minister who took office a few year earlier . Inside the government , a small right-wing uprising had been brewing over his plan to bring Australia into compliance with the Paris climate accord . It is well established among those who have worked for the Murdochs that the family rarely , if ever , issue specific directive . They convey their desire indirectly , maybe with a tweet — a Murdoch did in the spring of 2016 when he decided to back Trump — or a question , the subtlety of which are rarely lost on their like-minded news executive .
 In the day that followed , Sky Australia ’ s host and the Murdoch paper — the newspaper editor had their own drink session at Lachlan ’ s mansion — set about trying to throw Turnbull out of office . Alan Jones , a Sky host and conservative radio star , called for a party “ rebellion ” against him on his program . Days later , the Murdochs ’ major paper in Sydney , The Daily Telegraph , broke the news that a leadership challenge wa in the work . Cheering on the challenge , Andrew Bolt , the Murdoch columnist who wa once convicted of violating the country ’ s Racial Discrimination Act , told his Sky viewer that Turnbull ’ s “ credibility is shot , his authority is gone. ” Peta Credlin , the commentator who wa Tony Abbott ’ s former chief of staff , chewed out a member of Parliament for the chaos inside Turnbull ’ s administration . The Australian , the Murdochs ’ national newspaper , wa soon declaring Turnbull a “ dead man walking . ”
 Word got back to Turnbull about Lachlan ’ s remark to his staff . He knew that Sky After Dark had been becoming increasingly critical of him : Months earlier , an aide showed him a video montage of promotional clip from the network questioning his leadership of the country . “ Is it always like this ? ” the aide recalled him asking . But he now believed that this tough coverage wa part of a concerted campaign . One of his senior aide confronted the Murdochs ’ Australian executive in a text that wa shared with u . The Turnbull camp knew , it said , that “ Lachlan had made it clear at the editor drink on Tuesday night that he would like MT to get rolled . ”
 Turnbull heard , too , that Rupert Murdoch wa miffed at him because he had not reached out to him since he landed in the country , according to three former official in Turnbull ’ s government . Turnbull ’ s chief of staff had been trying to set up a meeting with Murdoch ; he now redoubled his effort . Turnbull settled for a phone call , pleading with Murdoch to back off . “ Let me have a look at it , and let me talk to Lachlan , ” Murdoch said . “ I ’ m retired . I ’ ll talk to Lachlan. ” ( Through a spokesman , Murdoch denied that he felt slighted by Turnbull . )
 Two day later , Turnbull ’ s right-wing opponent ousted him through a definitive intraparty vote , known in Australian politics a a leadership “ spill. ” Chaos ensued , creating round-the-clock political theater for Sky Australia , which logged it highest rating in the network ’ s history . ( The Murdochs have denied any role in the ouster . )
 It wa always difficult to separate the personal from the financial and the ideological with the Murdochs . All appeared to be in evidence in their decision to turn against Turnbull . To begin with , he took office a few year earlier by ousting Lachlan ’ s friend Tony Abbott , and it wa Abbott who helped lead the Turnbull uprising . Turnbull ’ s policy were also not perfectly aligned with the Murdochs ’ interest . For instance , he had expedited the construction of the country ’ s national broadband network , which directly threatened the family ’ s highly profitable cable business by giving Netflix a government-subsidized pipeline into Australian home .
 The small number of Australian medium outlet that the Murdochs did not own portrayed Turnbull ’ s ouster a a Murdoch-led “ coup. ” Kevin Rudd , a former prime minister whom the family had helped push out of office year earlier , described Murdoch in an op-ed in The Sydney Morning Herald a “ the greatest cancer on the Australian democracy . ”
 Turnbull wa replaced by the right-wing nationalist Scott Morrison , who quickly aligned himself with Trump . The two met in person for the first time in late 2018 at the G-20 summit meeting in Buenos Aires . “ I think it ’ s going to be a great relationship , ” Trump said afterward . With a national election scheduled for May 2019 , Morrison quickly staked his party ’ s prospect on the polarizing issue of immigration , promising a new hard-line approach . It dovetailed with Sky ’ s regular prime-time programming . Andrew Bolt , who previously warned of a “ foreign invasion , ” said in one segment , “ We also risk importing ethnic and religious strife , even terrorism , ” a the screen flashed an image of Australia ’ s potential future : row of Muslims on a city street , bowing toward Mecca . When the opposing Labor Party managed to muscle through legislation that would allow doctor to transfer severely sick migrant in detention center on the island of Nauru and Manus into hospital in Australia , Sky Australia ’ s prime-time host went on the offensive .
 The third generation of the Murdoch dynasty wa finally taking control . The Disney deal wa still pending regulatory approval in a few country — the two company had overlapping operation in China , Mexico , Brazil and elsewhere — but Lachlan wa already shifting to his new role a chairman and chief executive of the new Fox . The empire wa much smaller , but in political term , at least , it wa no le powerful , and it direction wa clear .
 Lachlan generally avoids on-the-record interview , but now that he wa taking ownership of the family business , it seemed appropriate to make at least one public appearance . He chose the New York Times-sponsored DealBook conference about corporate leadership . On Nov. 1 , le than three month after the Australian “ coup , ” Lachlan appeared onstage in the Time Warner Center in Midtown Manhattan . Tieless , in a white shirt , a navy suit and his trademark black outback boot , he offered a selfless account of the Disney deal . “ We immediately saw that this made a great deal of strategic sense , ” he told his interviewer , the New York Times columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin . He asked Murdoch if there wa any part of him that wa disappointed at the prospect of the shrinking of his would-be empire . “ Your first thought is shareholder , ” Lachlan replied . During the brief Q. and A. that followed , Lachlan dismissed the critic of Fox News a narrow-minded . “ No , I ’ m not embarrassed by what they do at all , ” he said of the network ’ s prime-time host . “ I frankly feel that in this country , we all have to be more tolerant of each other ’ s view . ”
 In the day leading up to the conference , some Fox News host and guest had been moving ever closer to openly embracing the most bigoted sentiment of the white-nationalist movement . A few day before the anti-Semitic attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue that killed 11 Jewish worshiper , a guest on Lou Dobbs ’ s show had said that a migrant caravan headed to the United States border from Honduras wa being funded by the “ Soros-occupied State Department. ” ( The network apologized . ) The shooter , according to a post he made on social medium , had come to believe that Jews were transporting member of the migrant caravan . When Tucker Carlson came under fire for his increasingly pointed attack on immigration — “ We have a moral obligation to admit the world ’ s poor , they tell u , even if it make our country poorer and dirtier and more divided ” — he received personal text message of support from Lachlan , according to two people familiar with the text .
 The line between Fox News and the Trump White House were continuing to blur . At Hannity ’ s urging , Trump hired the unemployed Bill Shine a his deputy chief of staff for communication in the summer of 2018 , ushering in a new era of increased hostility between the White House and the mainstream medium : Within day of his arrival in Washington in July 2018 , Shine called the Fox control room to change an onscreen chyron about Ivanka Trump that he considered unflattering , according to a source inside Fox , who say his request wa denied . Shine also barred Kaitlan Collins , a CNN White House reporter , from an event after she asked Trump several question about Michael Cohen and President Vladimir Putin of Russia .
 Unlike his father , Lachlan did not have a long-term relationship with Trump , but he hired the former White House communication director Hope Hicks a the new chief communication officer for the new Fox . Hicks wa only 29 , but she wa the rare member of Trump ’ s inner circle who left the administration on good term , and she remained very close to the president , the Trump family and others in the White House . ( Kushner ha privately told people that he provided a reference for her to Murdoch . )
 Lachlan ’ s first initiative wa Fox Nation , a subscription-only , on-demand streaming service started last fall for Fox “ superfans. ” It would be a platform for a new generation of Fox star and viewer . One of it most prominent personality wa Tomi Lahren , a 26-year-old recent graduate of the University of Nevada , Las Vegas , who had built a large social-media following with bite-size quip ; for instance , she referred to Black Lives Matter a “ the new KKK ” and to refugee a “ rape-ugees. ” Most of it show would be live-streamed during the day , making it a convenient alternative to the network ’ s daytime news programming , which wa too politically neutral for many Fox watcher . And because Fox Nation wa on the internet , the content could be even le restrained than the network ’ s evening programming . In addition to opinion-heavy political coverage , there would also be lighter fare — such a a cooking show with the “ Fox & Friends ” host Steve Doocy — and “ deep dive , ” including a documentary about the former anchor of the CBS Evening News : “ Black Eye : Dan Rather and the Birth of Fake News. ” Lachlan ’ s longer-term plan wa to take this undiluted , unchecked form of Fox News overseas .
 Roger Ailes once blocked Sean Hannity from hosting a Tea Party fund-raiser on his show . When Hannity and the Fox host Jeanine Pirro joined Trump onstage at his final rally before the November midterm election , the old Ailesian concern that the network should keep at least some distance from it political ally had come to feel quaint . Hannity played to the crowd , referring to all the reporter in the press pen a “ fake news ” and praising Trump ’ s accomplishment . After a tepid rebuke from management for participating in the rally , he clarified his comment about the press : They were not intended to refer to Fox ’ s reporter at the rally , he said , just the rest of the medium .
 At time , Fox News seemed to be dictating presidential policy , or at least channeling the base that appeared to control the White House ’ s agenda . In late 2018 , Trump wa heading toward a budget deal with the newly ascendant Democrats until guest and host across the network started shaming him , demanding that he not sign any government spending bill that didn ’ t include $ 5 billion for a border wall . “ Don ’ t listen to squish adviser , ” urged Pete Hegseth , a “ Fox & Friends ” host . He didn ’ t . He listened to Fox instead and shut down the federal government . It wa the made-for-TV climax of a campaign started month earlier . And like the enduring paralysis of the British government and the political upheaval in Australia , it wa the legacy of a single family that wa now descending into a chaos of it own .
 Having spent almost his entire adult life trying to prove that he wa worthy of running the Murdoch empire , James had finally broken with it . He struck out on his own at the end of 2018 , setting up his own family office in a new building in Greenwich Village to manage his vastly expanded fortune and invest in technology start-ups . By now , he and his brother were barely on speaking term .
 James had always accepted a a given the interlacing of politics and business that had built his family ’ s fortune . He had even practiced his own version of it , however unsuccessfully , in London . He had stayed with the company for more than two decade , to prove himself to his father and because of dynastic obligation . “ I can ’ t leave , ” he told a friend during the hacking scandal . “ I wa brought up to do this. ” The bond were not just emotional : His fortune wa tied up in his holding in the family business . In the end , his father had chosen Lachlan . The empire that James had long sought to run wa being dismantled . Lachlan had won their lifelong competition to become their father ’ s heir , but then , what had he really won ? To friend , James dismissed his brother ’ s new company a “ an American political project . ”
 But even now , James couldn ’ t fully distance himself from the new company : He wa still holding a large chunk of it voting stock , and a long a that wa the case , his fortune would be tied to Lachlan ’ s “ American political project. ” He couldn ’ t cash out , because Murdoch had made sure that none of his child would be able to sell their voting share to an outsider . And yet , a lever with which to influence the company , these share were virtually useless because their father remained the controlling shareholder in the family trust . James saw only one solution . He would sell his stock to Lachlan and his father , and maybe his sister would join him . What wa once a complex family dynasty would become a simple hereditary monarchy . Elisabeth and Prudence enthusiastically agreed . Murdoch , too , wa excited about the idea , seeing it a an opportunity to rid the company of an in-house critic . He urged Lachlan to do it : The two of them , father and son , would own the company together . The document were drawn up , but in late 2018 , given the chance to have the company to himself , Lachlan balked . ( Through a spokesman , Lachlan said that buying out his sibling wasn ’ t financially feasible . )
 Had Murdoch won or lost ? On the one hand , Murdoch had achieved everything he wanted . He had made all his child multibillionaires , while not only keeping the division of his company that wa most dear to him but also passing on control of it to his favorite son . Everyone , Murdoch included , had thought Hillary Clinton wa going to win in 2016 , but he had made a bet on a different candidate — and the power of a countervailing historical force — and he ’ d been rewarded with rating , money and access . And yet that bet had torn apart both his family and his company . What wa left wa not a sprawling medium empire that contained all his ambition , but a political weapon .
 James and Kathryn were planning to devote some of their fortune to try to neutralize that weapon . In early 2019 , their foundation , Quadrivium , announced initiative to defend democratic nation against what they saw a the rising threat of illiberal populism and to bolster voting right .
 The Disney deal wa scheduled to close in the spring . During the family ’ s final month a the owner of the storied 21st Century Fox , they attended the Oscar festivity one last time . It had long been an annual event for the Murdochs ; in an earlier era , the family hosted a few event of their own , celebrity-filled party at their Beverly Hills home .
 There wa a brief but memorable exchange at the Vanity Fair dinner during the ceremony . In one sense , it wa a recapitulation of the ideological conflict that wa dividing both the Murdochs and the world . In another , it wa just a family spat . When it came to the Murdochs , wa there really a difference ?
 At the Vanity Fair dinner during the ceremony , Kathryn wa seated next to Jon Lovett , a former speechwriter for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and a host of the vehemently anti-Trump podcast “ Pod Save America. ” Lovett did not seem thrilled with his table assignment , but a he and Kathryn started talking , it quickly became clear that she did not share the politics of the Murdoch family business . The conversation inevitably turned to Fox News and the damage it wa doing . Kathryn offered to introduce Lovett to the chief executive of the network , her brother-in-law , who wa seated at a table nearby . Lovett initially resisted — “ I don ’ t need to talk to this person . It ’ s not going to be pleasant for anyone ” — but later in the evening , Kathryn brought them together .
 “ Do you feel proud of what ’ s happening between 8 and 11 every night ? ” Lovett asked . “ You think this is good for the world ? ”
 “ Yeah , I think they ’ re doing a great job , ” Lachlan replied . Then Lachlan threw the question back at Lovett : Were there any conservative voice he would accept on Fox ? Before Lovett could answer , Kathryn interjected , ticking off a list of anti-Trump Republicans .
 Lachlan turned away and joined another conversation .
 On the morning of March 19 , 2019 , the new , streamlined Fox officially became a publicly traded , if Murdoch-controlled , company , with Lachlan a it chairman and chief executive and Murdoch a co-chairman . Its name wa simply Fox Corporation . A week earlier , Fox News held it first “ upfront ” for advertising agency , trying to reassure skittish ad buyer that the network represented a “ safe ” brand for their product , according to a report in Ad Age . There were videotaped interview with Fox News viewer — “ they deliver the news accurately and honestly ” — and a panel discussion with Fox personality , who expressed optimism about the state of the country and the network . “ This is a great time to be an American , ” Laura Ingraham said . “ Pretty much right now , I don ’ t see how it can get much better than this . ”
 In the 22-year history of the network , the Fox News Effect had never been more pronounced . A March study by Navigation Research , a Democratic firm , found that 12 percent of Fox News viewer believe that climate change is mostly caused by human , compared with 62 percent of all other Americans . At the same time , 78 percent of Fox viewer believe that Trump ha accomplished more than any president in American history , compared with 17 percent of other Americans .
 The same could be said of the more global Murdoch effect . Brexit-inspired chaos continued to rattle Britain . Both of Theresa May ’ s proposal to formalize the country ’ s break with the European Union were rejected by the British Parliament . The possibility of a “ no-deal Brexit ” — in which the country would simply crash out of the European bloc , quite possibly triggering a historic economic collapse — loomed . In late March , more than a million protester took to the street of London to demand a second Brexit referendum . With May ’ s fellow conservative questioning her continued leadership of the party , a former Murdoch columnist , editor and friend , Michael Gove — now a member of Parliament — wa being talked about a a possible replacement .
 Thousands of mile away , another consequence of the global ethnonationalist fervor that the Murdoch empire had amplified and mainstreamed wa playing out in New Zealand , where an Australian white nationalist , Brenton Tarrant , stood accused of killing 50 worshiper at two Christchurch mosque on March 14 . There wa no direct connection between Tarrant and Sky Australia , but critic of the network quickly drew attention to it consistently anti-Muslim rhetoric . In an online comment , unearthed by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation , Tarrant had described Trump ’ s election a “ one of the most important event in modern history. ” He wa also a fan of the white nationalist Blair Cottrell , whose appearance on Sky Australia over the summer caused American Express to pull it ad from the network . Following the massacre , a young Muslim employee of Sky News in Australia quit in protest . “ Over the past few year , I wa playing a role — no matter how small — in a network whose tone I knew would help legitimize radical view present in the fringe of our society , ” she wrote in a post on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation ’ s website .
 In the United States , what remained of the Murdoch empire wa already gearing up for the 2020 presidential election . One of it first step wa to bring The New York Post more in line with Fox News . The paper had long been Trump ’ s first read — it wa delivered daily to the White House — but it coverage wa not uniformly favorable . In January , the Murdochs brought back one of the paper ’ s former editor , Col Allan , to help run the paper . An old Trump golf partner , Allan had come up through Australia ’ s tabloid and ha been described a “ Rupe ’ s attack dog. ” Jesse Angelo , The Post ’ s publisher — and James ’ s lifelong best friend — resigned shortly after hearing the news .
 Across Fox News , host treated the submission of the Mueller Report in late March a the end of a two-year witch hunt and the beginning of Trump ’ s re-election campaign . The probe had resulted in the indictment of 34 individual ; guilty plea and conviction from five former Trump business associate or former campaign official ; and a number of ongoing state , federal and congressional investigation . But on Fox ’ s prime time , Mueller ’ s decision against bringing new indictment wa portrayed a vindication of what the host had been telling the audience all along : The investigation wa a deep-state coup by the Democrats , helped along by mainstream reporter who were deliberately misinforming the public . The Democrats and their ally in the press had failed to overthrow Trump this time , Fox ’ s host and their guest warned , but their effort would only grow more intense in the coming month . “ They need to be pummeled into the political dirt and become acknowledged a the minority they are , ” Rush Limbaugh , the dean of the right-wing radio host , said on Hannity ’ s show . The 2020 campaign and the new era of the Murdoch dynasty had begun .

 As I dipped a Mickey Mouse-shaped waffle in syrup for breakfast on my first full day in Walt Disney World , I heard a woman say to her friend , “ That look so good , but I ’ m trying to eat healthy on vacation . ”
 I didn ’ t say anything to her ( I mean , I don ’ t know her ) , but I bit back my own deep sigh .
 You might think that a a person who writes about running , I would endorse healthy eating while on vacation . But I hate this thinking — ditto any story about how many calorie an exercise will burn in order to “ earn ” a holiday food . It ’ s making exercise a punishment for indulging in something special . I don ’ t get to eat Mickey Mouse waffle every day , so I ’ m going to eat them when I can , and not feel guilty about it . The same for pumpkin pie I have once a year , and Valentine ’ s Day chocolate .
 If you ’ re already tallying how much you ’ ll have to run to combat a special food , that take both the fun out of the rare treat you ’ re enjoying , and out of the exercise done to so-called make up for it . ( When Runner ’ s World put one such post on Instagram this holiday season , which wa itself an ad for NordicTrack — which ha a vested interest in making you feel bad enough about eating to buy a workout machine — they got ripped for it , and rightfully so . )
 By now , most New Year ’ s resolution have crumbled , and one reason that can happen is people make them without the right motivation . If running is something you ’ re doing a punishment for eating , why would you want to keep doing that to yourself ?
 In 2015 , Claire Zulkey wrote an eye-opening piece for Elle about how she wa ordered by a therapist to take a break from exercising a part of treatment for a binge eating disorder . The goal wa to break the connection between food and working out , and to treat both thing like part of her life , without the amount of one being related to the amount of the other . It worked .
 “ I realized at some point that I am an exercise person now . I pack workout clothes for vacation and use them , ” she wrote . “ But I could only get here by divorcing exercise from food . I will work out whether the previous night ’ s dinner consisted of a salad or three slice of pizza and some Oreos . ”
 We run for a lot of reason , and yes , losing weight and staying in shape is a big one for most people — myself included . But there ha to be something more to it than that , or running a penance can become part of a cycle of disordered eating . That ’ s not good for you , your running or your happiness . And life is just too short to not eat Mickey Mouse waffle for the rare time you ’ re in Disney World , no matter if you ran seven mile that morning ( a I did when I overhead that conversation ) or zero mile , a I did on the last day of my trip when I still got the same breakfast — and a Mickey Mouse ice cream bar before I caught my flight home .
 I am back now , running in the same cold I ’ d left behind for a few day to hang out with Donald Duck . I don ’ t regret the waffle .

 ORLANDO , Fla. — After his Friday round at the Arnold Palmer Invitational , Rory McIlroy spent the afternoon at Walt Disney World riding the Tower of Terror amusement park ride . He wa persuaded to take the excursion by his wife , Erica , who reminded him that he visited Disney ’ s park last year and two day later produced an enchanted final round for a come-from-behind victory , his 14th on the PGA Tour .
 For those who hitch their allegiance to McIlroy , following him can be a white-knuckle ride . McIlroy ranked first in the field in driving distance for the measured hole , 314 yard , and he played his way into the final Sunday pairing for the ninth time since January of last year — and for the third time in 2019 . And for the ninth time since January of last year — and for the third time in 2019 , McIlroy , a four-time major winner and a former world No . 1 , could not close out a tournament from the last group .
 Francesco Molinari , the reigning British Open champion from Italy , who began the final round at Bay Hill five stroke off the lead , carded an eight-under-par 64 to finish at 12-under , two better than the 54-hole leader , Matthew Fitzpatrick , who posted a 71 .
 McIlroy , who closed with a 64 on his way to last year ’ s title , shot 72 to finish in a four-way tie for sixth . It is his fifth top-six finish in five start this calendar year , and also his 12th top-eight finish in his last 23 worldwide start .
 During his final-pairing run of close call , McIlroy , 29 , ha lost to some of the top player , including Tiger Woods , Dustin Johnson , Justin Thomas , Patrick Reed and Molinari .
 “ I ’ m playing well , ” McIlroy said . “ I would much rather be putting myself in position to have a chance to win . ”
 That is the lottery-half-won way of looking at it . The other way to view it is that when the title ha been within his grasp , McIlroy ha not hit his approach close enough or putted well . On Sunday , he played the par-5s in one-under .
 “ I just didn ’ t play the par-5s well enough , ” McIlroy said , adding , “ I wa saying to Matt walking up 17 it ’ s like we ’ re hitting really good shot , but we ’ re leaving ourselves putt that we were sort of being defensive with because you don ’ t want to run it 6 foot by trying to hole them . ”
 Putting wa not a problem for Molinari , who drained four birdie attempt of more than 17 foot , including a 21-footer at No . 1 and a 44-footer at No . 18 .
 “ One of my best putting round ever , ” said Molinari , who also coolly sank an 11-footer to save par at the second .
 The first of Molinari ’ s three victory last season came at the BMW P.G.A . Championship at Wentworth , which wa the third time in 2018 that McIlroy wa in the final group . He began the fourth round tied with Molinari , who shot four under for a two-stroke victory over McIlroy . By the end of the summer , Molinari had added the Quicken Loans and British Open title — and McIlroy had played his way into three more final-round pairing : at the World Golf Championships event in Ohio , the BMW Championship and the Tour Championship .
 “ When I won last year , playing with Rory , ” Molinari said , “ it wasn ’ t easy at all . So from there , I started building my confidence and just saying I could get it done . ”
 Molinari , 36 , wa grouped for the first two round with Brice Garnett and Ted Potter Jr. , two golfer with zero major title and three PGA Tour win between them .
 Despite his No . 10 world ranking and his star turn with Tommy Fleetwood for the European team at last year ’ s Ryder Cup , Molinari seemed easy to overlook on the leader board . Keith Mitchell , who consolidated his first tour title last week with a tie for sixth at Bay Hill , signed his scorecard for a closing 66 — and an eight-under total — while the leader were on the front nine .
 Asked what he thought the winning score would be , Mitchell guessed 10 or 11 under and said , unbidden , “ I think Rory McIlroy ’ s obviously proven himself time in and time out ” so that if he went lower , he added , “ I wouldn ’ t even be surprised . ”
 McIlroy is determined not to let the result define him . “ Yeah , my Sundays haven ’ t been what I would have liked , ” he said , “ but I ’ m putting myself in that position . Good golf is good golf . ”

 SANTA MONICA , Calif. — After a 20-month absence , “ Game of Thrones ” stormed back on Sunday night , setting a new rating record .
 The season premiere of the show ’ s eighth — and final — season had 17.4 million viewer , including viewership through it digital channel , HBO said . The previous record for a single episode of the series wa 16.9 million , for the seventh-season finale in August 2017 .
 HBO had 11.8 million viewer watching it the old-fashioned way on regular television , according to Nielsen . That narrowly missed the record of 12.1 million who watched the seventh-season finale on television .
 When there are more television show than ever and so many of them are watched on viewer ’ own schedule , “ Thrones ” is one of the few hit series left that qualify a appointment viewing .
 After Sunday night ’ s premiere , all of Twitter ’ s top trending topic in the United States were “ Thrones ” -related .
 Still , many more people will be watching it in the day to come . Last season , HBO said an average of 32.8 million viewer watched “ Thrones . ”
 There are only five episode left in the series , with four of the last five episode with run time at around 80 minute . Sunday ’ s episode wa a relatively modest 54 minute .
 HBO is in victory lap mode a it finally wrap up the most popular show in it network ’ s history . The network is exploring way to expand the “ Thrones ” franchise . A prequel will begin filming next month , though HBO executive have been reluctant to use the word “ franchise ” in it future development plan for a “ Thrones ” universe , the way Disney ha taken advantage of it “ Star Wars ” franchise .
 But it is also an anxious time for the premium cable channel . AT & T , which assumed full ownership of HBO in June , ha signaled that it ’ s bringing great change to Warner Media , HBO ’ s parent .
 Richard Plepler , HBO ’ s longtime chief executive , stepped down in late February after he felt that he wa losing the independence that he wa accustomed to . Several other HBO executive have departed in the month since . Robert Greenblatt , the former chairman of NBC Entertainment , took over a chairman of Warner Media ’ s entertainment division in March .
 And HBO will also have to find a way to keep subscriber happy a “ Thrones ” sign off . The season will conclude it run on May 19 .

 Uber published the prospectus yesterday for it long-awaited I.P.O. , revealing the full scale of it ride-hailing empire — and potential warning sign for what is expected to be the biggest market debut in year .
 The main revelation :
 • $ 1.8 billion in loss last year , excluding gain from selling part of it business in Southeast Asia and Russia .
 • $ 11.3 billion in overall revenue .
 • 91 million monthly user , including service like food delivery and shared scooter and bike rental .
 • Its biggest shareholder include SoftBank of Japan and it co-founder and former C.E.O. , Travis Kalanick .
 Growth is slowing . In 2018 , revenue rose 42 percent from a year earlier . It had doubled the year before . And revenue from ride-hailing , it biggest business , wa roughly flat for the last six month of 2018 . Growth in monthly user also appears to be slowing .
 That could be a concern for investor who had hoped Uber would maintain a meteoric growth rate . A potential $ 100 billion valuation may be lower than expectation , but Lex point out that it ’ s still a rich number .
 More : How Uber stack up against Lyft . What Uber ’ s metric like “ core platform contribution margin ” actually mean . And Uber executive stand to make huge bonus from a big I.P.O . — it driver , not so much .
 Chevron said this morning that it planned to acquire Anadarko , the oil and gas producer , in what would be one of the biggest deal in the industry in year .
 • Under the term of the deal , Chevron would pay $ 65 a share in stock and cash . That is 39 percent above where Anadarko ’ s stock closed yesterday .
 • Including Anadarko ’ s debt , the transaction is valued at $ 50 billion .
 • Anadarko would give Chevron a huge presence in the Permian Basin in West Texas , one of the most valuable oil-producing area in the U.S . It would also strengthen Chevron ’ s liquid natural gas reserve .
 If completed , the deal would be Chevron ’ s biggest since it $ 36 billion takeover of Texaco , which closed in 2001 .
 The deal come a oil price have risen over the past six week after a reduction in supply by OPEC member . Futures for West Texas Intermediate crude reached $ 64.19 per barrel this morning , up 61 cent from their last closing price , according to Reuters .
 In Amazon ’ s annual letter to it shareholder , Jeff Bezos shared insight about the financial performance of his e-commerce behemoth .
 “ Third-party seller are kicking our first-party butt . Badly , ” Mr. Bezos wrote . Third-party sale on Amazon increased to $ 160 billion in 2018 from $ 100 million in 1999 — a compound annual growth rate of 52 percent . Amazon ’ s first-party sale rose to $ 117 billion from $ 1.6 billion in the same period , a growth rate of 25 percent .
 Growth in Amazon ’ s total merchandise sale is slowing , according to calculation by Shira Ovide of Bloomberg Opinion . She writes that the company sold $ 300 billion worth of merchandise in 2018 , up 19 percent from the previous year . But annual increase for that metric were 24 percent for 2017 and 27 percent for 2016 .
 “ It ’ s unfair to expect Amazon to grow like a start-up forever . But it ’ s not insignificant that this slowdown ha come even a Amazon ha attempted to flex more muscle in newer category , ” Ms. Ovide writes . “ It doesn ’ t seem like a coincidence that this come a it legacy retail competitor finally seem to have awakened and adapted to the e-commerce era . ”
 More : Mr. Bezos also dared retail rival to raise their minimum wage . A Walmart executive shot back by asking Amazon to pay tax .
 Four Republican senator said that they would not back Mr. Cain should President Trump nominate him a a Fed governor . That ’ s probably enough opposition to stop him from joining the central bank .
 “ If I had to vote today , I would vote no , ” Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said yesterday , joining Mitt Romney of Utah , Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Cory Gardner of Colorado in opposing Mr. Cain . They appear to have concern about his qualification and partisanship .
 Because Republicans hold only 53 Senate seat , a confirmation would require support from Democrats . That seems unlikely , given Mr. Cain ’ s frequent attack on opposition lawmaker .
 It ’ s unclear whether Mr. Trump ’ s other pick for the Fed , the economics commentator Stephen Moore , will fare better . Mr. Moore ha been embarrassed by revelation of tax problem , but Jim Tankersley of the NYT report that he may win wider support from Senate Republicans .
 Mr. Trump ’ s effort to politicize the Fed continue to outrage commentator . The Economist is worried that “ the Fed will become a political weapon , and that America will move closer to becoming a nation where the welfare of the ruling party trump that of the country a a whole . ”
 As part of trade negotiation with America , China ha offered new concession on access in the cloud-computing sector for U.S. tech company , the WSJ report .
 • China is “ proposing to issue more license that business need to operate data center and to lift the 50 percent equity cap that limit ownership for certain foreign cloud-service provider , ” according to unidentified source .
 • “ Amazon , Microsoft , Apple and others have invested million of dollar or more to provide cloud service in China , but are hampered by regulation . Better access would potentially allow them to enlarge their presence . ”
 • “ Questions still remain over the detail of the latest Chinese proposal , the people said , such a how quickly the equity cap would be removed , and whether the removal would be confined to certain geographical area , such a a free-trade zone . ”
 Both Washington and Beijing are offering a final round of concession , hoping they will lead to an agreement . President Trump said last week that he expected to reach a deal within the next four week .
 The owner of The National Enquirer may have found a potential buyer : Ron Burkle , the supermarket mogul , the NYT report .
 Mr. Burkle is known for buying distressed company , having made his fortune through buying and merging supermarket chain like Ralphs and Jurgensen ’ s . He ’ s also known for hobnobbing with celebrity like Leonardo DiCaprio and Madonna .
 He ’ s also a big donor to the Democratic Party , and wa close to President Bill Clinton . That would make his owning The Enquirer , the tabloid favored by Mr. Trump , unusual . ( He is also friend with Mr . Trump . )
 But leak of the Enquirer talk may scuttle a deal . After the NYT reported on the discussion , a spokesman for Mr. Burkle ’ s private equity firm said that the investor wasn ’ t in talk to buy the publication . The NYT report that Mr. Burkle ’ s team felt “ used ” by American Media Inc. , the tabloid ’ s current owner .
 The WikiLeaks founder wa arrested yesterday in London to face a charge in the U.S. of conspiring to hack into a Pentagon computer network in 2010 , the NYT report .
 • “ The Ecuadorean government suspended the citizenship it had granted Mr. Assange and evicted him on Thursday , clearing the way for his arrest . ”
 • “ At a court hearing , a judge swiftly found him guilty of jumping bail , and he wa detained partly in connection with an American extradition warrant . ”
 • “ Mr . Assange indicated that he would fight extradition , and legal expert said that process could take year . He is likely to argue that the case is politically motivated . ”
 The event brought to a head issue about press freedom . Mr. Assange ’ s work with WikiLeaks — obtaining and publishing information that official would prefer be kept secret — are hard to legally distinguish from journalism . Some fear that journalist could be treated in a similar way .
 Mr. Assange wa indicted on a charge of hacking , not publishing secret . But people who are worried about press freedom shouldn ’ t necessarily rest easy , Charlie Savage of the NYT writes .
 More : President Trump once claimed to “ love WikiLeaks. ” Yesterday , he said : “ I know nothing about WikiLeaks . It ’ s not my thing . ”
 The dust ha settled on the agreement to delay Britain ’ s withdrawal from the E.U . for at least six month . But reaction to the situation have been mixed .
 Business are unhappy . For many larger company , Brexit ha already happened . But “ business of all size are still pleading for Parliament to give them clarity before the economy slows , ” Amie Tsang of the NYT writes .
 Economists are pleased . The I.M.F. ’ s managing director , Christine Lagarde , said that the new Brexit date meant that Britain would avoid — for now — the “ terrible outcome ” of a no-deal departure . The Bank of England governor , Mark Carney , said the delay would make a no-deal exit le disruptive .
 And Prime Minister Theresa May is pushing on . She ha “ renewed her effort to push through her Brexit deal with the aid of the opposition Labour Party , in a desperate bid to avoid holding European parliamentary election in a month ’ s time , ” according to the FT .

 Good morning ,
 We start today with Israeli voter ’ embrace of Benjamin Netanyahu , the start of general election in India , and stunning galactic news — the first image of a black hole .
 The election result in Israel prove , once again , that Israelis can not imagine life without Benjamin Netanyahu at the head of government — even if he could be toppled in the month ahead on corruption charge .
 Mr. Netanyahu is widely credited with having built a strong economy and keeping Israel secure . He ha also delivered long-sought diplomatic victory , several of them with the help of President Trump .
 What ’ s next : President Reuven Rivlin is expected to choose , within day , the party leader he belief ha the best chance of assembling a parliamentary majority . Preliminary result suggest that would be Mr. Netanyahu , whose Likud party ha stronger potential partner than the Blue and White alliance of his chief rival , Benny Gantz . Here are the latest update .
 Mr. Netanyahu is almost certain to try to persuade his coalition partner to pas a law granting him immunity from prosecution .
 Political shift : More than a million Israelis voted for Blue and White , a record for a new party , placing it in the position of being the main alternative to Israel ’ s right wing , a spot held for decade by the Labor Party .
 It ’ s the biggest democratic exercise in human history : 900 million eligible voter , at least 11 million poll worker and 2.3 million electronic voting machine .
 The first wave of India ’ s voter hit the poll today to select a new Parliament . The voting will play out over the next five week . The incoming lawmaker will select a prime minister .
 Go deeper : The race is effectively a referendum on Prime Minister Narendra Modi , who is facing a strong challenge by the Congress party . Many Indians believe that his administration ha been more effective , le corrupt and better at positioning India on the world stage than past government . Others think his right-leaning political party , the Bharatiya Janata Party , ha alienated minority and stoked fear .
 Theresa May met with European leader in Brussels to plead for more time to salvage her faltering withdrawal plan . The current deadline is tomorrow .
 European Union official were expected to offer Britain extra time for it departure from the bloc — well beyond the June 30 deadline extension Mrs. May requested .
 If it is pushed to the end of the year , there are factor that could break the current deadlock in London : Parliament approving a deal , a general election , a second referendum or a change of prime minister .
 Voices : Mrs. May ’ s weakness at home and abroad ha not gone unnoted on the Continent . One German publication described her visit to Berlin and Paris on Tuesday a a “ begging tour . ”
 Warning : The International Monetary Fund said that an abrupt Brexit would throw Britain into a two-year recession that would leave it economy 3.5 percent smaller than forecast .
 Astronomers unveiled the first image of a black hole , an object so dense that not even light can escape it gravity .
 The image showed a dark circle surrounded by swirling fog of radio noise in the heart of a galaxy .

 Wednesday ’ s unveiling of the first image of a black hole — found in the Messier 87 galaxy , roughly 55 million light-year away — ha captured the imagination of scientist and amateur astronomer around the world . But of all the intriguing and humbling phenomenon to be found in outer space , why are black hole such a particular fascination ?
 Maybe it ha something to do with science-fiction , which ha long exploited the narrative possibility offered by these inescapable region of space ( a in the movie “ High Life , ” which debut this week ) . What follows is a look at some of the best streamable movie in the black hole canon : We can ’ t guarantee all the science , but we can tell you where to find them .
 [ Read about the first ever image of a black hole . ]

 Walt Disney Productions had a humble goal for this ( then ) big-budget production : Two year after “ Star Wars , ” the company wanted a blockbuster space opera of it own . According to the book “ The Mouse Machine , ” by J. P. Telotte , the studio took notice of the increasing chatter in scientific circle about black hole ( Archibald Wheeler had coined the term in 1967 ) , revising the original script and focusing on the crew of a deep space mission and it discovery of not only a black hole but also another ship that somehow managed to elude the gravitational pull . Reviews were mixed , and the film recouped only it cost . But it did introduce an important new element to Disney filmmaking : computer-generated animation .

 Perhaps no single scientist shaped more of our contemporary thought and fascination with black hole than the theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking , whose idea about black hole , quantum mechanic , radiation and relativity were neatly packaged in his 1988 best-seller “ A Brief History of Time : From the Big Bang to Black Holes. ” Four year later , the director Errol Morris ( “ The Thin Blue Line ” ) released his documentary film adaptation of the book , featuring extensive interview with Hawking and his colleague , friend and family , intermingling his biography with vivid and ingenious visualization of his thought and theory . Hawking ’ s work is dense and complex , but Morris ’ s dazzling film furthers the source book ’ s mission of making the science of space a bit more understandable to the layperson .

 The new image from Messier 87 wa possible , in a large part , because of a network of radio antenna known a the Event Horizon Telescope . That name ha a logical tie to it target : The event horizon is “ the edge of a black hole , the point of no return , ” according to the Times reporter Dennis Overbye , who note , “ beyond the event horizon , not even light can escape the black hole ’ s gravitational pull. ” But it will summon a different connotation to movie fan . Paul W.S . Anderson ’ s “ Event Horizon ” make black hole into horror fodder , telling the story of a vessel that creates an artificial black hole in order to make a space travel wormhole . Suffice to say , thing go very wrong .

 Science-fiction television show , like the later iteration of “ Star Trek ” and “ Battlestar Galactica , ” have made black hole a mainstay of their storytelling . But the “ Star Trek ” film series hasn ’ t had much use for them , with the notable exception of J.J. Abrams ’ s 2009 reboot of the franchise . Nero ( Eric Bana ) , the Romulan villain of the film , us the principle of the black hole for dastardly end , creating an artificial black hole out of “ red matter ” to destroy the planet Vulcan . But then a real black hole creates a time warp that sends Mr. Spock back in time to help Captain Kirk and his own younger self try to stop Nero . ( It all make sense in the movie . )

 This Kubrick-inspired sci-fi adventure from Christopher Nolan hang a key plot point on black hole : The deep-space crew at it center , led by the former NASA pilot Joseph Cooper ( Matthew McConaughey ) , is sent to explore a wormhole leading to potentially habitable planet . But the wormhole ’ s proximity to a black hole cause gravitational time dilation ; in the brief time Cooper and another crew member ( Anne Hathaway ) spend exploring one of the planet , 23 year of earth time elapse , causing duress for the scientist . Nolan , known for his meticulousness , took great pain to try to ensure that the science of the film checked out , and it rendering of the black hole wa considered by many to be the most realistic yet in a fiction film .

 “ Mr . Morris conveys something of what Dr. Hawking think about black hole evaporation , imaginary time and curved space , ” The Times ’ s Timothy Ferris wrote about Morris ’ s “ A Brief History of Time. ” “ But for most viewer , these exotic idea will be overshadowed by the human drama of the great physicist ’ s triumph over adversity. ” The director James Marsh focused firmly on that drama in this biopic , with an Oscar-winning Eddie Redmayne a a young Hawking and an Oscar-nominated Felicity Jones a his future wife , Jane . As they struggle to come to term with a motor neuron disorder that confined him to a wheelchair for the rest of his life , he develops his initial theory about the visibility of black hole — though there is not much time to get into scientific specific .

 WEST HOLLYWOOD , Calif. — Fred Rosen , the retired Ticketmaster tycoon , wa eating a melted ham-and-brie sandwich at the exclusive San Vicente Bungalows and spouting forth about belt .
 Yes , what people use to hold up their pant . You can buy one at Walmart for $ 4 , he noted . Or you can get one at Gucci for $ 1,500 . “ Every product I can think of ha a luxury version , which got me thinking , ” Mr. Rosen said . “ Why not movie ? ”
 It ’ s an idea that ha captivated one entrepreneur after another over the year : For a high price , allow tech billionaire , Wall Street titan , professional athlete , Russian oligarch and other ultra-wealthy people to rent movie — a soon a they come out in theater — for viewing at home . Think of it like Netflix for one-percenters . But such upstart have always sputtered , including one backed by Best Buy in 2013 that charged $ 500 per movie on top of $ 35,000 in setup cost . Film studio , fearful of angering theater chain , have been reluctant to participate . Piracy ha also been a concern .
 Mr. Rosen , 75 , and a septuagenarian golfing buddy , Dan Fellman , who is Hollywood ’ s foremost film distribution expert , may have finally figured out how to make it work . They have quietly founded Red Carpet Home Cinema , which rent first-run film for $ 1,500 to $ 3,000 each . Red Carpet ha contract with Warner Bros. , Paramount , Lionsgate , Annapurna and Disney ’ s 20th Century Fox and Fox Searchlight division — resulting in some 40 movie annually , including blockbuster like “ Aquaman ” and “ A Star Is Born . ”
 Those partnership reflect entertainment-industry relationship that Mr. Rosen and Mr. Fellman have cultivated over decade . Most studio do not see them a disrupters from Silicon Valley , something that ha stalled start-ups like Screening Room , which ha tried without success since 2016 to speed first-run movie to home for a premium price . ( Sean Parker of Napster and Facebook fame is behind that one . )
 Red Carpet also arrives at a time when the movie industry is undergoing sweeping change — not the least of which involves the manner in which Netflix is challenging the traditional way that film are released . For the most part , theater owner insist on a three-month period of exclusivity to play new film . Netflix ha started to chip away at that practice , offering theater an exclusive window of three week or le for film like “ Roma ” and “ Bird Box . ”
 Most studio see broader distribution change a inevitable , noted Harold L. Vogel , author of the textbook “ Entertainment Industry Economics . ”
 “ Consumers want to have more control , ” Mr. Vogel said .
 Even so , studio are treading carefully . None of the film company that have signed on a Red Carpet partner would discus the venture publicly . Several major movie operation , including Universal , Sony Pictures and Disney ’ s other label , are Red Carpet holdout . They also declined to comment .
 “ I feel pretty comfortable that we can gain more studio partner , ” Mr. Rosen said . “ We are a niche offering — I ’ m too old for disruption — but even if a studio make $ 25 million to $ 50 million annually from u , that ’ s found money . ”
 Theater owner , in the meantime , seem to be taking a wait-and-see approach to Red Carpet .
 “ I have no take on that , ” said Adam Aron , chief executive of AMC Entertainment , the dominant theater chain in the United States . In contrast , Mr. Aron ha readily criticized start-ups like MoviePass , the subscription ticketing service .
 The folksy Mr. Rosen , who took over Ticketmaster in 1982 and helped turn it into a goliath , and Mr. Fellman , who started his studio career in 1964 , worked out detail for Red Carpet over round of golf at the well-to-do Hillcrest Country Club in Los Angeles . The luxury service operates a bit like a private club . There is a rigorous application process , and participant must have a credit card with a limit of at least $ 50,000 . Those who become customer must buy a $ 15,000 box that connects to a home theater system ( installed by a technician ) and come loaded with piracy protection .
 Prices for rental are set by the participating studio , with higher fee for blockbuster-style movie like “ Shazam ! ” and lower cost for drama like “ The Shape of Water. ” Each rental allows for two viewing in a 36-hour period .
 How big could Red Carpet get ? There are more people who can afford it than you might think . Nearly 46,000 Americans have annual income of more than $ 2 million , according to Social Security Administration data from 2017 . Mr. Rosen and Mr. Fellman , however , insisted over lunch in mid-March that they were not interested in size .
 “ We ’ re not even looking for 10,000 people , ” Mr. Rosen said . With fewer than 4,000 customer , Red Carpet could have $ 300 million in annual revenue , according to Mr. Fellman ’ s projection .
 Red Carpet , which count Sherry Lansing , the former chief executive of Paramount , a an investor , ha been operating in about 25 home a part of a beta test since December . “ I ’ m recommending the service to my friend , ” the Red Carpet website quote Ms. Lansing a saying .
 Mr. Fellman added : “ I ’ m not interested in starting a business that is disruptive to the theatrical experience . Maybe we get 400 home in New York and L.A. Maybe 100 in each of the 30 biggest city in the United States. ” ( Celebrities and Hollywood big shot have long been able to see first-run film in their home — free — a part of something known a the Bel-Air Circuit . Studios allow a limited number of preapproved V.I.P.s to “ borrow ” copy of new movie . )
 “ We told studio , ‘ You set the term , ’ ” Mr. Fellman said . “ They appreciated that . What doesn ’ t work in Hollywood is going in and wagging a finger and saying , ‘ This is how it ’ s going to be . ’ ”

 Kevin Tsujihara , the chief executive of AT & T ’ s recently acquired Warner Bros. studio division , ha stepped down after accusation surfaced that he had pushed for a woman with whom he had a sexual relationship to be considered for role in the company ’ s film and television show .
 Mr. Tsujihara , who ha worked at the studio for more than two decade , said he made the decision to leave the company after discussing the matter with John Stankey , WarnerMedia ’ s chief executive .
 “ Over the past week and a half , I have been reflecting on how the attention on my past action might impact the company ’ s future , ” Mr. Tsujihara wrote in a memo to employee . “ After lengthy introspection , and discussion with John Stankey over the past week , we have decided that it is in Warner Bros. ’ best interest that I step down a chairman and C.E.O . ”
 The allegation against Mr. Tsujihara emerged in a March 6 article in The Hollywood Reporter , which outlined a sexual relationship between Mr. Tsujihara , 54 , and Charlotte Kirk , an actress in her 20 . The Reporter , quoting from private text message it obtained , portrayed a situation in which Mr. Tsujihara — prompted by Ms. Kirk ’ s statement that he had promised to help her career during a meeting at a motel — contacted his lieutenant on her behalf .
 “ I just need to be careful , ” Mr. Tsujihara , who is married , said in a 2014 text message , according to the trade publication . “ Let ’ s look for a movie role . ”
 WarnerMedia said in a statement that the investigation into Mr. Tsujihara ’ s behavior would continue despite his departure . When the allegation first came to light , a lawyer for Mr. Tsujihara said his client “ did not have a direct role in the actress being cast in any movie . ”
 In a separate memo to employee , Mr. Stankey said that “ Kevin ha acknowledged that his mistake are inconsistent with the company ’ s leadership expectation and could impact the company ’ s ability to execute going forward . ”
 Mr. Tsujihara wa promoted two week ago in a significant management shake-up that gave him additional duty . He wa put in charge of WarnerMedia ’ s effort to develop child ’ s content , which will play a significant role in AT & T ’ s streaming business . The telecom giant acquired the studio last June a part of it $ 85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner .
 Mr. Tsujihara wa appointed even though whisper about his alleged conduct had circulated in Hollywood for more than a year . Mr. Stankey became aware of the allegation in September when he received an email from an anonymous account asking whether an actress had been offered speaking role in film in exchange for silence about sex with a senior executive . Reporters from 11 publication , including The New York Times , were copied on the anonymous email . At the time , Mr. Stankey enlisted the law firm Munger , Tolles & Olson to look into the claim .
 That investigation concluded without any hit to Mr. Tsujihara , and he wa promoted in early March . But The Hollywood Reporter article spurred the latest investigation and the renewed scrutiny of the studio head ’ s action .
 Powerful men in Hollywood have been put in the spotlight ever since the # MeToo movement gained momentum , ensnaring men like Brett Ratner , a producer and financier with whom Mr. Tsujihara wa once close . The Reporter article , written by Tatiana Siegel and Kim Masters , also detailed text message between Ms. Kirk and Mr. Ratner involving Mr. Tsujihara and acting role . Mr. Ratner ha denied accusation of sexual misconduct made by multiple woman .
 The whiplash of Mr. Tsujihara ’ s departure ha unnerved the rank and file at Warner Bros. , which AT & T ha enlisted to help jump-start it streaming business . Warner ’ s television studio have been a significant supplier to Hollywood and have sold show to the broadcast network , the cable channel and streaming service like Netflix . AT & T is banking on Warner ’ s operation to help create new show for it online video operation , which is set to debut by the end of the year .
 The transformation started in June when AT & T , based in Dallas , ventured beyond it core business to acquire Time Warner , the home of HBO , the Warner Bros. movie studio , CNN , and cable channel like TBS and TNT . The phone giant started to overhaul the medium business in earnest last month after the Justice Department lost a second court challenge to the merger and said it would no longer try to block it .
 After the green light , AT & T altered it leadership team and named Robert Greenblatt , the former head of entertainment at NBC and Showtime , a the new chairman at WarnerMedia . His hiring followed the resignation of Richard Plepler , the longtime chief executive of HBO , and David Levy , the president of Turner Broadcasting , the division that includes TBS and TNT .
 WarnerMedia said it wa starting a search for a successor to Mr. Tsujihara , but there are few in Hollywood who have the stature and experience to run a major company like Warner .
 Some , however , have been looking for a new job . Stacey Snider will be leaving a head of 20th Century Fox studio after the Walt Disney Company close it acquisition for the majority of Rupert Murdoch ’ s medium empire this week . Thomas Staggs , the former chief operating officer of Disney , ha been on the shortlist for other top medium position .
 Peter Chernin , who wa once second in command to Mr. Murdoch when he ran the mogul ’ s film business , ha been advising Mr. Stankey and could play a role in finding a replacement . Mr. Chernin worked with him and AT & T ’ s chief executive , Randall Stephenson , on a joint venture called Otter Media , a company AT & T bought last year .

 6 . The dollar is still king .
 Despite many prediction after the financial crisis that the dollar might finally founder , it ha amassed greater stature a the favored repository for global saving , the paramount refuge in time of crisis and the key form of exchange for commodity like oil .
 Its potency ha enabled the Treasury to find buyer for bond at enviably cheap rate and given added bite to Mr. Trump ’ s foreign policy by amplifying the power of his trade sanction — especially against Iran and Venezuela .
 Between the beginning of 2008 and late 2018 , the share of reserve that central bank worldwide held in dollar remained roughly constant , at around 62 percent of the total , according to the International Monetary Fund . Reserves entrusted to the euro , the dollar ’ s most formidable competitor , stand at 20 percent , and China ’ s currency make up only 2 percent .

 Participants in virtual race run whenever they can , wherever they can , and say they still have some of the sense of being part of a crowd , even if they ’ re running alone .
 By Jen A. Miller
 On a recent Sunday morning , Kate Silvester ran a 5K . She didn ’ t have to worry about where to park to get to the starting line in time : She just headed out to a biking and running path behind her house and onto a back road .
 Her race wa a virtual 5K associated with the NYC Half , which wa run in New York the same day .
 Virtual challenge and run are part of a growing trend in recreational running : doing a race whenever you can , wherever you can , and still feeling a if you ’ re part of the crowd , even if you ’ re running alone .
 Bob Bickel , founder of the race registration platform Run Sign Up , said the organization saw virtual race pop up “ in earnest ” about five year ago . One of the first popular virtual run , he said , wa that of Jeff Galloway , a running coach who train runner using a run-walk-run method . In 2018 , 1,050 people finished Mr. Galloway ’ s virtual event , which included a 5K and half marathon .
 “ People are used to running with their apps , and I think more and more people are comfortable with connecting virtually , ” Mr. Bickel said , “ whether it ’ s on Facebook or Instagram or Snapchat , people can actually have friendship even though they don ’ t see each other . ”
 Ms. Silvester , 44 , of Plainsboro , N.J. , said her first virtual run came through the tracking app Run Keeper . In 2017 , she wa new to the sport , and she ’ d been using the app to track her progress . She saw that she could participate in a “ challenge ” event , where runner who donated $ 35 to Beat Nb , a nonprofit that fund research for the childhood cancer neuroblastoma , got a T-shirt for completing the run .
 She ’ d done traditional race before , but a a single mother of two who work full time , she liked the flexibility of something virtual .
 Virtual run are structured in various way .
 Disney ’ s Virtual Run 5K series started in 2016 and us the honor system . Runners can download bib to wear to do the virtual run . When they finish one — or all — of the three 5Ks in the series , they can download a finisher ’ s bib and are mailed a medal .
 “ It wa an interesting opportunity for u to really keep people involved with runDisney year round , ” said Faron Kelley , vice president of Disney Sports . Most on-site runDisney event are held in cooler month , so the Virtual Run 5K series is held in the summer . Last year ’ s series , which wa themed to “ The Incredibles , ” had about 18,000 participant . This year ’ s series , with registration opening on May 7 , is Marvel themed , with each 5K costing $ 40 ; doing all three , which includes a fourth medal for completing them all , cost $ 145 . RunDisney also put on a virtual Star Wars Half Marathon in the winter and early spring — for 2019 , it cost $ 59 ( and is open through March 31 ) .
 The Great Pumpkin Run virtual race series also us the honor system . For $ 35 , runner are mailed a race hoodie and a bib . Previously , the race sent race medal after runner submitted their time , but this year , Courtney Young , co-founder of the race , said medal will be mailed along with the hoodie and bib . “ People want that instant gratification , ” she said . Ms. Young said the race ha also worked with Strava , an exercise tracking app , but it ’ s not a requirement ; they trust that runner aren ’ t lying .
 The Great Pumpkin Run started a a traditional race series in 2012 , but the virtual option ha taken off since it wa introduced in 2016 . The first year , 300 runner did the virtual option ; last year there were close to 14,000 . “ I think it ’ s helping people get into the sport , ” Ms. Young said . It appeal to runner who may not be able to show up to a race on a certain time and day , or who are intimidated by running with other people in their first race .
 The New York Road Runners added virtual run to it race roster in 2018 , and this year it ha 12 , most themed to a holiday or event , like the Resolution Run 5K or the Valentine ’ s Duo 5K . It also had a virtual half marathon and 5K connected to last weekend ’ s NYC Half , the one Ms. Silvester ran .
 The New York Road Runners ’ virtual race are free , unless runner are using them a a way to get into a sellout race . In 2018 , the organization opened 500 spot for runner to run a virtual marathon , which , if they completed it , would get them a race medal and guaranteed entry into the New York City Marathon this year ( it cost $ 150 , compared to $ 295 to run in the actual marathon ; they also got a finisher medal but no finisher shirt ) . For guaranteed entry into the 2020 Brooklyn Half Marathon , runner can sign up for and complete each of six virtual race , at $ 20 per race . They also get access to a virtual trainer a part of their fee .
 While runner can use whatever GPS watch or app they want to track their run , they must upload it into the Strava app in order for it to count .
 The virtual run started with the question of “ how can we continue to engage and extend our impact across the global running community and provide way in which people can run with u without being here in New York City ? ” said New York Road Runners president and chief executive Michael Capiraso .
 For Ms. Silvester , Sunday ’ s virtual run wa part of her recovery from an injury . “ It wa only my third run since getting back from injuring my hip flexor , so I took it pretty slow and included walk break , but I did it , ” she said .
 She ’ s hoping to do the Brooklyn Half next year , which would be her first half marathon . “ It ’ s hard to picture myself getting to a half marathon in the next year or so , but it wa good to get back into running after a long break , ” she said .

 Jordan Peele is holding a new mirror up to society , and this weekend proved just how many moviegoer want a look at it reflection .
 Universal ’ s “ Us , ” the latest politically resonant horror movie from Peele , sold an estimated $ 70.3 million in ticket over the weekend , easily leading the domestic box office and more than doubling the opening-weekend ticket sale of $ 33.4 million for Peele ’ s smash-hit directorial debut , “ Get Out . ”
 It make sense that audience were primed to see “ Us ” : When “ Get Out ” wa released , Peele wa still best known for sketch comedy , not directing horror movie . The runaway success of “ Get Out ” ( it went on to gross around $ 175 million ) wa a product of euphoric review and strong word-of-mouth a the movie dominated the cultural discussion in the day and week after it release .
 [ Read how Lupita Nyong ’ o created that creepy voice . ]
 Even so , few predicted this level of success for “ Us. ” Analysts expected it first-weekend ticket sale to land closer to the $ 40 million mark .
 The movie star Lupita Nyong ’ o , Winston Duke , Shahadi Wright Joseph and Evan Alex a a family tormented by their evil , scissor-wielding doppelgängers . The film ’ s generally strong review ( it hold a 94 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes ) likely helped sustain excitement going into this weekend ; many critic said the movie is both scarier and more ambitious than “ Get Out , ” although perhaps lacking that film ’ s clarity .
 [ Read our critic ’ s review of “ Us . ” ]
 The promise of Peele ’ s scares-with-a-message wa more than enough to deliver “ Us ” the No . 1 spot . It unseated Disney ’ s “ Captain Marvel , ” which landed in second place with about $ 35 million in it third weekend , according to Comscore , which compiles box-office data .
 Both “ Us ” and “ Captain Marvel ” are diverse movie , with the former led by black actor and a black director and the latter starring a female superhero , the first Marvel Cinematic Universe film to do so .
 Third place went to Paramount ’ s animated “ Wonder Park , ” which sold $ 9 million in ticket . And CBS Films and Lionsgate ’ s romantic drama “ Five Feet Apart ” came in a close fourth , with about $ 8.8 million . Both of those movie were in their second weekend .

 There are those perennial stage work that are perfectly suited to be performed in high school across the country every year : say , “ Our Town , ” “ The Crucible , ” “ Annie ” or “ The Wizard of Oz . ”
 And now , to this canon , you might add “ Alien . ”
 A New Jersey high school ha found itself the unexpected recipient of online acclaim and viral attention for it recent stage production of “ Alien , ” the 1979 science-fiction thriller .
 “ Alien : The Play , ” presented last weekend by the drama club of North Bergen High School , starred a cast of eight student in the film role originally played by Sigourney Weaver , Tom Skerritt , John Hurt and Ian Holm .
 Whereas the movie had a budget in the range of about $ 10 million , “ Alien : The Play ” had costume , prop and set design made mostly from donated and recycled material .
 Both the film and the stage adaptation feature a nightmarish extraterrestrial designed by the artist H.R . Giger — played , in this production , by a high school student .
 “ Alien : The Play ” is the brainchild of Perfecto Cuervo , an English teacher at the school and the moderator of it drama club , and Steven Defendini , an art teacher there .
 Last year , the two teacher worked together on a student staging of “ Night of the Living Dead , ” the George Romero zombie movie . This past summer , they started to plan a follow-up .
 As Mr. Cuervo recalled their conversation , he said , “ Do you think we can do ‘ Alien ’ a a play ? ” It seemed to require few set , he said : “ We have a spaceship . We have a planet . It could be handled . ”
 Mr. Defendini said he answered , “ I don ’ t know how to do that . I don ’ t know if we can do that . But we ’ re going to do that . ”
 The original “ Alien ” wa directed by Ridley Scott and written by Dan O ’ Bannon . Released by 20th Century Fox , it is a claustrophobic horror film about the crew of a small outer-space vessel that encounter an unwelcome , nonhuman stowaway that ha come to be known a the xenomorph . ( Spoiler alert : The story doesn ’ t end well for most of them . )
 The film wa a substantial hit , critically and commercially , that burrowed itself deep in the cultural consciousness and started a decades-long film franchise .
 Mr. Cuervo , who directed the student ’ version , said he spent about a month and a half adapting it from the film . Casting took place in November ; the crucial role of Ripley ( the Sigourney Weaver character ) went to Gabriella Delacruz , a senior at the school .
 Ms. Delacruz , who had been in the school ’ s “ Night of the Living Dead , ” said that she wa proud to carry on the feminist tradition that Ripley represents .
 “ She ’ s a female character who ’ s really portrayed a the hero at the end , ” she said . “ She isn ’ t the damsel in distress . She got to be a badass , if I ’ m allowed to say that . ”
 Xavier Perez , a sophomore , wa chosen to play the xenomorph . “ When we did the casting , ” Mr. Cuervo said , “ there wa one person that showed up — a tall , skinny kid . I told him , ‘ Well , I guess you ’ re it . You ’ ve got the part . ’ ”
 Rehearsals began in December , while Mr. Defendini , the play ’ s art director , oversaw the creation of exotic terrain and spaceship interior , trying a best a possible to reproduce the aesthetic of the film .
 “ Some of the wall are covered in egg crate , not because it wa the cheapest solution but because it wa the most authentic , ” Mr. Defendini said .
 Using a variety of material , some of which were donated by Tom Carroll Scenery , a stage production and design shop in Jersey City , the teacher estimated the total cost of the play wa under $ 3,500 .
 The performance relied on an additional six student crew member , plus another five to ten who helped operate sound board and light and supply other special effect .
 “ We had four kid on laptop , doing sound effect , ambient noise and alien noise , ” Mr. Cuervo said . “ We used a lot of the band kid , because they know how to play instrument and they were really good with the cue . ”
 Though the original “ Alien ” movie is about to turn 40 year old , Mr. Defendini said it character still resonated with his teenage student , who know it monster from video game , pop-cultural lore and recent sequel like “ Alien : Covenant . ”
 “ We had kid in the crew who knew the specific genesis and specie of the xenomorph , ” he said . “ What gender it is , what planet it ’ s from . Everything you could know . ”
 Asked if the drama club had sought official permission to present the play , Mr. Cuervo said , “ Our main goal wa really just to put on a great play for the kid , just get them out , stage front . ”
 ( The Fox film studio wa acquired earlier this month by the Walt Disney Company . A press representative for Disney did not immediately respond to a request for comment . )
 “ Alien : The Play ” ha drawn widespread praise on social medium ; an official promotional Twitter account for the “ Alien ” franchise said , “ We are impressed ! 40 year and still going strong … ” and “ Bravo ! ”
 The comedian Patton Oswalt wrote , “ This is fantastic . Blows my high school ’ s adaptation of PINK FLAMINGOS out of the water . ”
 An online trailer ha received more than 130,000 view on YouTube , and the production wa covered on news site like The Verge and The AV Club .
 Mr. Defendini pointed out that a tweet about “ Alien : The Play , ” posted by Leslye Headland , a co-creator of the Netflix series “ Russian Doll , ” had been liked by Joss Whedon , the writer and director of “ The Avengers . ”
 That , he said , wa sufficient validation for the student .
 “ For them , that ’ s enough , to be acknowledged by their favorite movie director , ” Mr. Defendini said . “ For a bunch of high school kid , I can ’ t imagine what it ’ s like to see how much recognition they ’ re getting for seven month of hard work . ”

 No matter how much free time you have this weekend , we have TV recommendation for you . Come back every Friday for new suggestion on what to watch .
 ‘ Andi Mack ’ When to watch : Friday at 8 p.m. , Disney Channel
 This midseason finale ha our tween heroine , Andi ( Peyton Elizabeth Lee ) , caught up in multiple drama-llama scenario : Are her parent calling off their wedding ? Are her friend betraying one another ? Are people breaking up because of the well-intentioned advice she ha given ? And why doe everyone seem to let her down on costume day ? “ Andi Mack ” is often charming but rarely cutesy , and the character are all so articulate about their emotion you almost want them to lead a course .
 ‘ Free Solo , ’ When to watch : Sunday at 9 p.m. , National Geographic
 Alex Honnold is arguably the greatest rock climber who ever lived , and he specializes in climbing without any safety gear , relying instead on meticulous planning , superhuman focus and a level of finger strength that is genuinely hard to comprehend . This film earned a best documentary Oscar last weekend , and it ’ s well deserved : It ’ s thrilling and intimate , and like it star , balanced . The bigger the screen you can watch this on , the better .
 ‘ Naked City ’ When to watch : Now , on Amazon
 “ Naked City , ” which debuted in 1958 , is one of the ur-police procedurals , and it feel even more episodic than today ’ s crime show because it focus tends to be on the crime and caper more than on the investigation . Some episode are more emotional , some a little flashier . And between the famous guest star the stylish visual language and the dramatic narration closing every episode , “ Naked ” sometimes feel like “ The Twilight Zone , ” but instead of sci-fi , it ’ s a cop show .
 The first two season of the show are now streaming . Season 1 is half-hour episode , and Season 2 is hourlong episode .

 One thing we learn in “ Captain Marvel ” is that it ’ s pronounced MarVELL , like the English poet — or at least it used to be , on distant planet and right here on Earth , a windy rock also known a C-53 . That wa back in 1995 , when most of this movie take place and when the world a we know it had not yet been colonized by the Marvel Cinematic Universe . Yes , of course , Marvel Comics had been around for decade , but when the heroine crash through the roof of the Blockbuster Video store , landing in between the “ Family ” and “ Drama ” section , there are no Avengers or Iron-Man title on the shelf .
 Instead , she pick up a VHS box of “ The Right Stuff , ” which earns a mild chuckle , since while we know that she ’ s a space alien named Vers ( rhyme with “ cheer ” ) , we also have reason to suspect that this young woman is connected with the United States Air Force , and maybe the space program , too , like the guy in that film . Also known a Carol Danvers , and played by Brie Larson , she ha some of their bravado , and also — since she ’ s on the way to intergalactic superheroism — a righteous sense of mission and a burgeoning identity crisis .
 [ Captain Marvel ha had many , many identity in the comic . ]
 The last and least surprising thing we learn about her is that “ Captain Marvel will return in ‘ Avengers : Endgame , ’ ” a scrappy little picture that will be released in seven week , if you can stand to wait that long . Directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck from a script they wrote with Geneva Robertson-Dworet , “ Captain Marvel ” is an origin story , which is to say a résumé check for the newest member of popular culture ’ s biggest , most heavily capitalized corporate team .
 As such , it ’ s pretty good fun , and could almost be described without sarcasm a a scrappy little picture , like most of Boden and Fleck ’ s other work . ( Their résumé includes “ Half Nelson , '' “ Sugar ” and “ It ’ s Kind of a Funny Story ” ) . It ’ s not too long , not too self-important , and benefit from the craft and talent of a cast that includes Annette Bening , Jude Law and Ben Mendelsohn .
 And of course Samuel L. Jackson , who play a young , two-eyed S.H.I.E.L.D . agent named Nicholas Fury . How Fury lost one of those eye is the big spoiler to avoid here , and the character ’ s extended presence , after so many agitated cameo over the year , is a big part of the movie ’ s appeal . To watch the digitally rejuvenated Jackson riding around mid-90s Los Angeles , sort of like he did in “ Pulp Fiction , ” is to indulge in a bit of Gen-X nostalgia , a mood augmented by period-appropriate musical cue from Salt-N-Pepa , TLC and Nirvana .
 [ Can ‘ Captain Marvel ’ fix Marvel ’ s woman problem ? ]
 There are pay phone and pager , too , and boxy government car and all kind of stuff that kid these day just don ’ t appreciate . Even the science-fiction element have a mildly retro , “ Star Trek : The Next Generation ” feel . And the overall vibe , for all the fireball and fisticuffs , is decidedly friendly . In addition to the Vers/Fury buddy-movie pairing , there is a best friend for Carol ( a fellow pilot named Maria Rambeau , played by Lashana Lynch ) and a succession of frenemies . Best of all , there is an orange cat . I will never hate a movie with an orange cat .
 The plot of “ Captain Marvel , ” for some reason , is another secret I ’ m supposed to keep . Which is fine . In spite of what some unhinged fan on social medium might say , I wa not paid by Disney to explain anything . Boden and Fleck were , and they do a perfectly adequate job . There ’ s a big war going on between the Kree — Vers ’ s people , at least a far a she know — and the Skrull , green-skinned , pointy-eared being who have the unnerving skill of turning into doppelgängers of anyone they see . Annette Bening is involved . We first see her a a manifestation of Supreme Intelligence , which seems accurate enough . I ’ ll say no more .
 The twist in the story reveal a slyly anti-imperialist politics , which is both in keeping with the pluralist ethic of the Avengers cycle and just a bit subversive of the Disney-Marvel agenda of universal domination . The most sympathetic group of character want nothing more than to go somewhere else , to escape from the annihilating attention of their would-be conqueror . They might represent various oppressed and dispossessed earthly population . They might also stand in for that portion of the movie audience that feel the cinematic universe shrinking around them .
 Not that anyone can stop the Marvel Cinematic Universe from expanding . By now the contradiction of this gigantic enterprise are obvious enough . It ’ s inclusive and monopolistic , predatory and empowering . Every episode is unique — every hero is a complex individual with a singular back story — within an overall structure of sameness .
 Filmmakers like Boden and Fleck , Ryan Coogler and Taika Waititi can put their own spin on a given story or hero , but at some point bolt or wave of orange or blue light will come shooting out of someone ’ s hand and someone else will be thrown backward and bounce off a wall . The protagonist ’ s costume will become a character in it own right . That protagonist — a tough and charming woman , in this case , determined to fight gender clichés at least to a draw — will be ready for a career of franchise clock-punching , along with the rest of u . You will stay through the very last credit in the hope of collecting every last Easter egg , and you ’ ll shuffle out of the theater feeling both satisfied and empty .

 The new AT & T is coming into focus .
 On Monday the company took a step closer to becoming something never before seen on the American corporate landscape — part telecommunication behemoth and part media-entertainment giant .
 The transformation started in earnest last June when AT & T , based in Dallas , ventured beyond it core business and muscled into New York and Los Angeles with it $ 85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner , the former home of HBO , the Warner Bros. movie studio , CNN and cable channel like TBS and TNT . Last week , the deal wa set in stone when the Justice Department , after losing a hard-fought appeal to block it , said it would no longer try to undo the merger .
 With this final green light , AT & T ha in recent day altered it leadership team with an eye toward reinvention .
 On Monday , the company named Robert Greenblatt , the former head of entertainment at NBC and Showtime , a the new chairman at Warner Media , a job that will give him oversight of Time Warner property like HBO , TBS and TNT . His hiring followed the resignation of Richard Plepler , the longtime chief executive of HBO , and David Levy , the president of Turner Broadcasting , the division that includes TBS and TNT .
 As part of it executive shake-up , AT & T — which gained 26,000 employee in the merger , giving it 268,000 worldwide — also promoted the CNN chief Jeff Zucker and the Warner Bros. studio head Kevin Tsujihara , both of whom will oversee bigger portfolio .
 John Stankey , an AT & T veteran who wa put in charge of Warner Media at the time of the acquisition , is the executive behind the move , which show that the company is serious about tearing up old way and putting it own stamp on it new property . The company ’ s two core business are both facing upheaval a tech company like Amazon , Netflix , Apple , Google and Facebook have become dominant player in both entertainment and distribution .
 “ If you don ’ t make a change , you ’ re not going to get any change in the product , ” Mr. Stankey said in an interview on Monday .
 Mr. Stankey ’ s assignment is to help AT & T beat out it traditional rival Verizon , T-Mobile and Sprint by offering not only service plan but also “ Game of Thrones ” and 24-hour news . At the same time , AT & T ’ s entry into the medium sphere will eventually allow it to compete in the streaming business against company it ha rarely done battle with before , including the Walt Disney Company , Comcast , Netflix , Amazon and others .
 He emphasized that AT & T didn ’ t want to muddy the brand within Warner Media , a group comprising HBO , CNN , TNT , Cartoon Network and the Warner Bros. film and TV studio .
 “ We just needed to get them to sing and dance differently and have them take different approach , ” he added .
 With the hiring of Mr. Greenblatt — who ha experience a a mainstream broadcaster at NBC and a a programmer of prestige cable fare at Showtime — Mr. Stankey belief he ha someone who can make Warner Media ’ s offering broadly popular , without losing their distinctive identity .
 “ There aren ’ t that many people who have both , ” Mr. Stankey said . “ He ’ s got the right track record . ”
 Mr. Greenblatt , who go by Bob , took over a chairman of NBC in 2011 , when the network wa in dire strait . Over his seven year , he brought NBC back from the dead with series like “ The Voice , ” Dick Wolf ’ s fleet of Chicago show and “ This Is Us. ” NBC , which he left in September , now regularly finish No . 1 among the advertiser-prized group of 18-to-49-year-old viewer .
 In a statement , Mr. Greenblatt said , “ I ’ m honored to be joining Warner Media during such an exciting time for the company and the industry a a whole , and I look forward to working alongside the many talented executive and team member across the company . ”
 While overseeing HBO and the like , Mr. Greenblatt will also manage the product that may be the most important of all , from AT & T ’ s perspective : Warner Media ’ s streaming service , which is scheduled to debut this year .
 AT & T on Monday announced a set of sweeping management change at WarnerMedia a the carrier prepares to debut a streaming service later this year .

 Online video ha become crucial to every medium business a customer cut their cable cord and go to the movie mainly for big-spectacle blockbuster . Netflix and Hulu are signing up million of new customer every quarter , and entertainment giant like Disney and Comcast plan to start their own service by the end of the year . Amazon is spending more on original show , and Apple plan to unveil it streaming effort , with new programming , this year .
 The appointment of Mr. Greenblatt allows Warner Media to speed up it plan for a streaming business , a process that wa hampered under the older structure , Mr. Stankey said .
 “ We had to put a bit of a Band-Aid organization on top of thing before we made this change , ” he said . “ Still , I think we ’ ve done a remarkable job with what we had . The new combined WarnerMedia will be much more successful filling in the gaps. “
 AT & T wa handcuffed until recently a it fought a lawsuit brought by the Trump administration ’ s Justice Department to block the merger . The company agreed to take a hands-off approach to it Turner division , which includes CNN and TNT , until the appeal wa concluded . AT & T beat back that challenge last week , giving the company free rein .
 Concerning the resignation of Mr. Plepler , who had been at HBO for 27 year , and Mr. Levy , who had spent 32 year at Turner Broadcasting , Mr. Stankey said , “ I wa disappointed but I don ’ t know that I wa completely surprised. ” He added , “ When you have someone who had a tremendous amount of autonomy , they tend to covet that . ”
 Mr. Stankey plan to be a much more active steward of Warner Media than it executive had anticipated , three people familiar with the new AT & T said . He ha started to consolidate advertising , distribution and production department across Turner and HBO , a well a some of the back-end function like human resource , accounting and technology . Those move effectively took away large chunk of matter once overseen by Mr. Plepler and Mr. Levy , the people said .
 In Mr. Stankey ’ s view , Warner Media needed to reorganize the TV network in a way “ where they could cooperate more together , ” he said , which meant that some top executive would have reduced role . He said his discussion with Mr. Plepler and Mr. Levy , which took place separately , never got far enough to explore what role they each might accept .
 Going up against Netflix and Disney will be tough . Mr. Stankey acknowledged that a household is likely to pay for just four or five of these service , and that AT & T will have to prove it worth to consumer .
 At a company presentation in November , he outlined three tier of online video service that have been in the work : an entry-level option centered on film ; a “ premium ” service that includes original television programming and film ; and a final product that includes both of those tier plus classic movie , comedy and child ’ s content . Under the plan , HBO would still be available a a stand-alone service .
 But it is unclear which Warner Media brand will be part of each tier or how each will be priced . Even the name of the video service remain a mystery .
 “ No news on that today , ” Mr. Stankey said on Monday .
 The lack of hard information on the streaming strategy ha frustrated executive within Warner Media , several people familiar with the internal operation have said . But some have wondered if the lack of communication wa the result of the Justice Department ’ s court challenge .
 Mr. Stankey acknowledged that his sometimes laconic approach might have baffled those inside the organization . “ I ’ ve read article out there saying that I ’ m not prone to flap my gum , and that may not be inaccurate , ” he said . But Hollywood , not used to such a reserved manner , might require him to open up more . “ I ’ m trying to find a middle ground on it , ” he said , adding that with the lawsuit behind them , he ’ ll be able to talk more frequently .
 As part of the reorganization , Mr. Zucker , the head of CNN , will also begin to oversee Turner ’ s sport operation . That includes the website Bleacher Report , a well a Turner ’ s deal with the National Basketball Association , Major League Baseball and the National Collegiate Athletic Association . With the job , Mr. Zucker get a new title : chairman of news and sport .
 Mr. Tsujihara , the chief executive of the Warner Bros. movie studio , will continue in his position and also take on what Warner Media described a a “ new global kid and young adult business. ” Children ’ s content is likely to be a critical part of the streaming service and represents a big part of Mr. Tsujihara ’ s portfolio .
 “ As the economics change , it ’ s becoming more and more important to align content value , consumer product and ad sale , ” Mr. Tsujihara said in an interview . “ It take a real need for deeper level of coordination across the different division . ”

 ( Want to get this briefing by email ? Here ’ s the sign-up . )
 Good morning ,
 We start today with a Brexit delay , a fifth term for Netanyahu and the first image of a black hole .
 European Union leader agreed to push the deadline for Britain ’ s departure from the bloc back to Oct. 31 , staving off a chaotic , no-deal exit that wa set for Friday .
 It wa longer than Prime Minister Theresa May had hoped for — she proposed June 30 , which many found unrealistic . European leader agreed to review the arrangement at the end of June .
 At a news conference after a long night of negotiation , Donald Tusk , the European Council president , said the two side had agreed to what he called “ a flexible extension . ”
 What it mean : Britain will almost certainly have to hold election for the European Parliament on May 23 — something Mrs. May once argued would be absurd , given that Britons voted to leave almost three year ago . That prospect will likely anger hard-line Brexit supporter .
 The path ahead , a you ’ ve probably guessed , remains a minefield .
 Benjamin Netanyahu is on course to become Israel ’ s longest-serving prime minister .
 With nearly all of the vote from Tuesday ’ s election counted , the centrist Blue and White alliance led by his rival Benny Gantz conceded , all but confirming that the country will stay on it conservative course .
 Mr. Netanyahu is widely credited with having built a strong economy and kept Israel secure . He ha also delivered long-sought diplomatic victory , several of them with the help of President Trump .
 What ’ s next : Mr. Netanyahu , who is likely to be indicted on bribery and fraud charge , is expected to try to persuade his coalition partner to pas a law granting him immunity from prosecution .
 Signs of division : More than a million Israelis voted for Blue and White , a record for a new party , making it the main alternative to Israel ’ s right wing .
 Arab perspective : The election underscored that the dream of a Palestinian state is more remote than ever — a is the chance that the United States will help create it .
 The Treasury Department said on Wednesday evening that it would not immediately comply with a congressional request to hand over President Trump ’ s tax return , setting up a protracted legal battle between two branch of government .
 Steven Mnuchin , the Treasury secretary , said in a letter that lawyer needed more time to ass the lawfulness of the request , expressing concern that it would violate taxpayer privacy . It wasn ’ t clear how long the review would take .
 Mr. Trump ha declined to release his return on the ground that the I.R.S . wa auditing him — even though no law prevents a taxpayer from releasing return while under audit .
 Points of contention : Mr. Mnuchin and many Republicans believe that furnishing the return could open the floodgate to weaponizing the Internal Revenue Service . Some Democrats say the language in the formal request for the return doe not give Mr. Trump the leeway to refuse it .
 Astronomers captured the first image of one of the most mysterious entity in the cosmos .
 A black hole is a cosmic abyss so deep that not even light can escape it . This one wa found in the heart of the Messier 87 galaxy , roughly 55 million light-year away .
 The image , showing a dark circle surrounded by a lopsided ring of light , illustrated a finding that shocked Albert Einstein when his equation predicted it in the early 20th century : that space-time can collapse when too much matter or energy is concentrated in one place .
 How they did it : Eight radio observatory , spanning six mountain and four continent , observed the galaxy on and off for 10 day in April 2017 . The image emerged after two year of computer analysis .
 Black hole cinema : If you can ’ t get enough , we rounded up some of the best streamable movie in the black hole canon .

 After decade of nearly slapstick mismanagement — spinning off TV and missing the internet — the studio behind “ The Godfather ” is fighting for it life .
 Paramount Pictures , the 62-acre studio founded in the 1910s , is fighting for it future in a rapidly changing Hollywood.CreditCreditPhotograph by Alex Welsh for The New York Times ; Photo-illustration by Gluekit

 It wa a legendary Hollywood battle , one filled with so much back-stabbing and subterfuge that Vanity Fair likened it to a horror movie : “ ‘ Wall Street ’ a directed by Hitchcock . ”
 For month starting in the fall of 1993 , two medium titan , Sumner M. Redstone and Barry Diller , fought each other for what wa then the entertainment industry ’ s ultimate prize : Paramount Pictures , the 62-acre studio behind classic film like “ The Godfather ” and “ Chinatown ” and contemporary blockbuster like “ Top Gun ” and “ Beverly Hills Cop . ”
 The home entertainment boom wa showering Hollywood with cash . But Paramount wa more than a money machine . Legacy studio like Paramount — founded in the 1910s , operating sumptuous soundstage complex and controlling vast film library — rarely came up for sale . Owning one made you a permanent power player , a certified member of the cultural elite .
 With a bid of $ 9.75 billion , or $ 17 billion in today ’ s money , Mr. Redstone ’ s Viacom took the spoil . “ Don ’ t tell me I don ’ t buy you anything for your birthday , ” he told his then-wife , Phyllis , a they celebrated with lawyer at the 21 Club in New York .
 Flash forward 25 year , and Paramount once again find itself at the center of a battle . Only this time the historic studio is not the belle of the Hollywood ball , not even remotely . Today , Paramount is fighting for it very existence .
 Almost slapstick mismanagement by Viacom — cleaving off a lucrative TV business , firing the horror maestro Jason Blum , missing the opportunity to buy Marvel Entertainment , describing Steven Spielberg a “ completely immaterial ” — ha left Paramount on life support . The studio racked up nearly $ 900 million in loss between 2016 and 2018 . It ha placed last at the domestic box office for seven year running . The 29-soundstage Paramount lot is long overdue for improvement ; $ 700 million in upgrade , unveiled in 2011 , have yet to happen .
 Paramount , along with the rest of Hollywood , is also colliding with Silicon Valley . Netflix , which occupies a rented office tower six block from Paramount headquarters , ha been swallowing the entertainment business whole . This year , the streaming service will pump out about 90 movie , including documentary . To compare , the five conventional studio left standing — Paramount , Universal , Sony , Disney and Warner Bros. — will make about that many combined . Paramount is set to contribute 13 .
 The old-line film business is only going to become tougher a streaming service proliferate . Apple intends to roll out it multibillion-dollar TV and movie offering in the month ahead . Facebook ha recently gotten serious about marketing it Watch video-on-demand platform . Scrambling to keep pace , entertainment company like Disney and Warner Media have bulked up — Disney with it $ 71.3 billion purchase of 21st Century Fox asset and Warner by selling itself to AT & T for $ 85.4 billion — and plan to introduce their own megawatt streaming service by the end of the year . Next to those supertanker , Viacom is the corporate equivalent of a canoe .
 All of which ha agent , director , writer and producer confronting uncomfortable question . Can Paramount — the studio that , more than any other , symbolizes Hollywood itself — find a path forward a a stand-alone studio ? Or , a they did at Fox , could it end credit roll ?
 “ I knew it wa challenged , ” said Jim Gianopulos , a veteran film executive who took over a Paramount ’ s chairman in 2017 and is leading a resuscitation effort . “ I didn ’ t know how much . ”
 Stroll around the Paramount lot , a we did one afternoon late last year , and you ’ ll see a frenzy of activity . Fleets of forklift carry newly fabricated set from the in-house woodworking mill . Gardeners tend the hibiscus hedge . Electricians hang light . Production staffer whiz around on golf cart . At a glance , Paramount seems every bit a vibrant a it wa when Mr. Redstone took over in 1994 .
 But the bustle is mostly an illusion . Few movie are shot in Los Angeles anymore , by Paramount or any studio . Of the 100 top-grossing film in 2017 , only 10 were shot in California , according to Film L.A. , which track production . It ’ s cheaper to make movie in state like New Mexico and Georgia , which offer fat subsidy . TV series are still taped on studio lot , but Mr. Redstone chopped his business empire into two piece in 2005 , and Paramount ’ s entire small-screen division went to the CBS Corporation .
 Paramount in many way ha become a glorified rental property . HBO lease Stage 17 for “ Barry , ” a comedy about a hit man who want to change profession . The weepy “ This Is Us , ” a Fox production that air on NBC , sprawl across three stage . Sony and Amazon rent other Paramount stage .
 “ The decision to move all of Paramount TV really crippled Paramount Studios , ” said Frank J. Biondi Jr. , who ran Viacom from 1987 to 1996 .
 Along with filling stage , TV production provides studio with a stable revenue stream — something to fall back on when big-budget film bomb , a some inevitably do . TV ha also been Hollywood ’ s growth engine over the last decade . At least 495 original scripted program aired in 2018 , up from 288 in 2012 , the result of new buyer like Netflix and Hulu .
 To pull Paramount back from the brink , Mr. Gianopulos and a new lieutenant , Nicole Clemens , are rebuilding the studio ’ s TV operation . Paramount restarted television production in 2013 and now ha nine series running , including “ The Alienist ” on TNT and “ Jack Ryan ” on Amazon Prime . Mr. Gianopulos said he hoped to have 20 series in production by the end of the year . Viacom said Paramount Television generated $ 400 million in revenue last year ; Mr. Gianopulos said the division ’ s profit wa on track to double this year compared with 2018 .
 With the pressure on her to deliver , Ms. Clemens wa still zealously working at 6 p.m. on a recent Friday . As we waited outside her office door , two assistant dialed phone a if their life depended on it .
 Ms. Clemens eventually came out from behind her desk . “ Oh , this is calm , ” she said . “ You should have seen u earlier . ”
 As important a TV is to Paramount ’ s financial future , Mr. Gianopulos said movie would always be the company ’ s anchor . To that end , in September 2017 he hired one of Hollywood ’ s top producer , Wyck Godfrey , whose resume includes the “ Twilight ” blockbuster , a president of the film division . Supporting Mr. Godfrey are new marketing , publicity and animation chief .
 “ It sound trite , but you are only a good a your team , ” Mr. Gianopulos said . “ And all of the key people that I have brought in are accomplished , experienced executives. ” He added of the new hire , perhaps commenting indirectly on hothead who have left the studio : “ None of them are screamer . None of them are hyperbolic . They ’ re all grown-ups . They ’ re all collaborative . ”
 Mr. Godfrey had experienced Paramount ’ s dysfunction firsthand a a producer . In 2016 , the studio abruptly pulled the plug on one of his project , a movie adaptation of John Green ’ s novel “ Looking for Alaska , ” amid a casting dispute .
 “ From my outsider ’ s perspective , this place had become very fear-based , and so my first job wa to try and change that , ” Mr. Godfrey said . “ I ’ ve said to anyone who will listen , ‘ We are going to start taking real chance on thing we believe in. ’ I will take the responsibility , the heat , when we miss , which is inevitable . But just go for it .
 “ We have to make more movie and also movie that stand the test of time , ” he continued . “ We have no choice . It ’ s the only way. ” Paramount hope to make 17 movie in 2020 .
 Mr. Godfrey ’ s coming film lineup emphasizes big-budget , global-audience movie , known in Hollywood a tentpoles . A long-gestating “ Top Gun ” sequel is finally happening . Mr. Godfrey is working to breathe life into the tired “ Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles , ” “ Terminator , ” “ Star Trek ” and “ G.I . Joe ” franchise . Paramount also ha high hope for film tied to Viacom ’ s cable network , including “ Dora the Explorer , ” a live-action , big-screen adaptation of the Nickelodeon cartoon .
 Whatever it box-office viability , though , such fare doesn ’ t quite scream “ stand the test of time . ”
 But Mr. Godfrey insisted otherwise . Imagine , for instance , Paramount giving “ Star Trek ” to Quentin Tarantino . “ Suddenly people ’ s eye light up , ” Mr. Godfrey said . “ Yours just did . ”
 He also pointed out that “ Mission : Impossible — Fallout , ” released by Paramount in August , had proved naysayer wrong . That film , the sixth chapter in a 23-year-old series , received euphoric review and generated $ 791 million in global ticket sale , 16 percent more than it franchise predecessor . Two more “ Mission : Impossible ” installment starring Tom Cruise are moving ahead .
 “ Fallout ” and another unexpected hit from last spring , “ A Quiet Place , ” helped Paramount post an operating loss of $ 39 million for 2018 , compared with a loss of $ 280 million a year earlier . To compare , the industry leading Walt Disney Studios had 2018 profit of $ 2.98 billion , up from $ 2.36 billion .
 More recent Paramount movie have delivered mixed result . “ Bumblebee , ” a well-reviewed “ Transformers ” prequel , ha taken in roughly $ 370 million , a respectable number if not exactly a breakout hit . A pair of fall comedy , “ Nobody ’ s Fool ” and “ Instant Family , ” fizzled at the box office .
 Mr. Gianopulos said a turnaround wa still early . He expects the studio to return to profitability this year . “ In a four-quarter game , ” he said , “ we ’ re halfway through the second quarter . ”
 Ask Hollywood ’ s power broker how Paramount went from prestige to debris and they will say they don ’ t want to speak ill of the dead . And then they will proceed , at length and with great verve , to speak ill of the dead .
 Mr. Gianopulos ’ s predecessor , Brad Grey , who led the studio for 12 year , resigned under pressure in February 2017 . He died from cancer three month later , stunning the movie capital . Almost no one knew he wa sick .
 Looking back , there were signal . Toward the end of his run , Mr. Grey wa rarely seen at Paramount . A rumor took hold , calcifying into legend , that his chauffeur would drive the car onto the lot and park — so it would look a if Mr. Grey were somewhere on the premise — and then take a taxi home . The studio ’ s vice chairman , Rob Moore , wa also frequently away . He spent a lot of time in China , where he worked on an unconsummated deal to sell a minority stake in the studio . He wa also dating a Chinese TV host .
 An absentee overlord may have contributed to the studio ’ s decline , but the decay can be traced to Mr. Redstone ’ s battle with Mr. Diller in 1993 . Mr. Redstone , viewed by Hollywood a cocksure and uncouth , wanted to acquire Paramount to prove that he ’ d made it — that he belonged . That he wa more than his cable business of VH1 , Nickelodeon and MTV , a medium company that the real bigwig called “ The House That Beavis and Butt-Head Built . ”
 Mr. Diller also had emotional tie to Paramount ; he had run the studio from 1974 to 1984 , finding hit like “ Grease , ” “ Raiders of the Lost Ark ” and “ Beverly Hills Cop. ” But Mr. Diller had vision of using Paramount to push Hollywood into a new era : that a budding “ information superhighway ” called the internet might someday run through the studio , bringing movie and TV show directly to computer .
 In other word , Netflix .
 Mr. Redstone , who ended up acquiring Blockbuster ( yes , that Blockbuster ) to get the deal done , and his lawyer made fun of Mr. Diller ’ s interest in the internet . They ribbed him for bringing a computer — one of Apple ’ s early brick laptop — into the negotiating room . The joke , it turned out , wa on Mr. Redstone , whose Viacom would miss internet opportunity at nearly every turn over the next 25 year . Mr. Diller went on to found IAC , a thriving collection of web business .
 Other shortsighted decision by Mr. Redstone and his crony — rooted in hubris and old-fashioned greed — dragged Paramount down . Longtime entertainment executive likened the studio ’ s mismanagement under Mr. Grey and his bos , Philippe P. Dauman , who ran Viacom from 2006 to 2016 , to an old horror movie . Perhaps “ Invasion of the Body Snatchers . ”
 “ You have this aching sensation in your belly when you see the studio eating itself , ” said Jonathan L. Dolgen , chairman of Paramount in the 1990s .
 The real debacle started in 2005 . To fortify Paramount ’ s slate , the studio bought DreamWorks SKG , bringing Steven Spielberg , Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen into the fold . But the alliance quickly became a clash of personality . At one point , Mr. Dauman told investor that Mr. Spielberg — the most powerful director in Hollywood then and now — wa , in effect , “ completely immaterial ” to the company ’ s earnings . Mr. Geffen pried DreamWorks loose from Paramount and Viacom in 2008 .
 Then , in 2009 , a micro-budgeted horror movie called “ Paranormal Activity , ” produced by Jason Blum and released by Paramount , became a runaway hit , spawning a $ 1 billion franchise . Instead of anointing Mr. Blum , Mr. Grey wanted to control the series — and take the credit . So he kicked him off the Paramount lot . Mr. Blum went to Universal , where he ha printed money , churning out low-cost blockbuster like “ Get Out , ” “ The Purge , ” “ Halloween ” and “ Split ” through his Blumhouse Productions .
 The next year , Paramount allowed Disney to buy out it right to distribute Marvel superhero movie . The deal helped Viacom executive hit financial target that triggered bonus . Paramount , however , wa hobbled down the road ; Marvel became Disney ’ s most reliable hit machine .
 Theories began to spread about how Mr. Grey kept his job . Early in his tenure , he had intervened at a movie premiere party to defend Mr. Dauman from an obscenity-laced fusillade by the producer Harvey Weinstein . Back then , nobody stood up to Mr. Weinstein , and the move endeared Mr. Grey to the refined Mr. Dauman . But it had been a setup . Mr. Grey had planned the confrontation with Mr. Weinstein , whom he had been close to ever since their early career .
 Mr. Dauman , who wa fired in 2016 , received $ 72 million in exit payment . At the time , Paramount wa losing $ 450 million a year , and Viacom ’ s stock price had fallen 50 percent over two year .
 Mr. Dauman could not be reached for comment . For his part , Mr. Grey insisted until the end that he had done the best he could with Paramount . He wa proud that Mr. Dauman had allowed him to stick with a romantic notion of the film business — one that found a place for auteur-driven movie like “ Silence ” from Martin Scorsese and “ Allied ” by Robert Zemeckis — even a competing studio , adjusting to business reality , had shifted almost entirely toward fantasy tentpoles .
 Hollywood saw Paramount a failing to evolve . It wa almost a if Mr. Grey and certain cohort were playing out scene from “ Sunset Boulevard , ” which Paramount made in 1950 .
 “ I am big , ” the delusional silent film star Norma Desmond insists in one famous moment . “ It ’ s the picture that got small . ”
 Paramount ha endured boom and bust cycle before . In the 1960s the studio ’ s then-owner , the industrial conglomerate Gulf & Western , very nearly sold a badly struggling Paramount for it real estate value . Talks began with a cemetery that border the studio . More burial plot were envisioned .
 That wa when Paramount ’ s young production chief , Robert Evans , turned a macabre drama , “ Rosemary ’ s Baby , ” into a box office juggernaut . Another unexpected hit , the teary romance “ Love Story , ” arrived in 1970 .
 Mr. Evans went on to make the studio a showcase for culture-defining cinema , serving up “ The Godfather , ” “ The Godfather II , ” “ Harold and Maude , ” “ Serpico , ” “ Chinatown ” and “ Urban Cowboy , ” among others . Those movie inspired many of today ’ s top director and film executive to pursue Hollywood career — an entire generation of creativity reared on what Paramount produced .
 A successor , Sherry Lansing , kept Paramount healthy until handing over the rein to Mr. Grey . Her tenure wa marked by the Academy Award-winning hit “ Forrest Gump , ” “ Braveheart ” and “ Titanic , ” a co-production with Fox . The studio wa so strong , in fact , that people in Hollywood referred to it by a nickname : “ the Mountain , ” a reference to it logo of a snow-capped peak encircled by star .
 So anything is possible . In the month ahead , Paramount is betting big on drug , gay sex and rock ’ n ’ roll : “ Rocketman , ” a musical about Elton John ’ s turbulent life and career , arrives from the studio in May , one of Hollywood ’ s most competitive month . Mr. Gianopulos see another potential success in Ang Lee ’ s “ Gemini Man , ” which will roll out in the fall and star Will Smith a an aging hit man who must combat a clone of his younger self .
 Generally boding well , Mr. Gianopulos ha repaired crucial relationship with producer . Hasbro , a partner that had grown disenchanted , agreed to a five-year extension , for instance .
 David Ellison , a producer and billionaire financier of big-budget movie like “ Terminator Genisys , ” wa on the verge of leaving Paramount for another studio home base ; Mr. Gianopulos persuaded him to sign on with Paramount for four more year . That relationship ha once again grown tense , however , with Paramount unhappy about Mr. Ellison ’ s decision to hire John Lasseter , who wa forced to resign from Disney last year amid # MeToo allegation .
 Mr. Gianopulos in November made a deal with Netflix to supply the streaming service with a handful of original movie a year , opening up a new revenue stream .
 And Paramount finally ha the full support of Viacom , where a new chief executive , Robert M. Bakish , ha put into motion an aggressive turnaround plan . In an interview on the 52nd floor of Viacom ’ s Times Square headquarters , Mr. Bakish noted that he had just returned from Hollywood , where he met with agent , telling them that , unlike his predecessor , he ha no plan to offload Paramount . If anything , Viacom wa doubling down on the studio : We are open for business , so bring u your script .
 “ It wa clear we had a major problem , ” Mr. Bakish said . “ But it ’ s Paramount — it ’ s the Mountain . ”
 Movie insider want to believe that Paramount will respond to the heart paddle . But some people are privately sitting vigil .
 When we reached Mr. Diller on a business trip in Europe to talk about his failed bid for Paramount and what ha become of the studio and the movie business , his first reaction wa to ask why anyone would bother writing about the studio .
 “ Why Paramount ? ” he asked . “ It ’ s irrelevant . ”
 Because of an editing error , an earlier version of this article overstated what is known about the severance Brad Grey received when he left Paramount Pictures . A reference to his exit package ha been removed from the article .

 At the “ Captain Marvel ” premiere in Los Angeles last month , Brie Larson roamed the red carpet in a sequined Rodarte slip dress , a galaxy of diamond cradling her ear . A squadron of F-16 fighter jet flew overhead a fan cheered the movie ’ s star a she climbed step to a stage where she wa interviewed by Lorraine Cink .
 Ms. Cink , a self-described comic book geek and red carpet host , did not ask Ms. Larson about her gown a others did that day . Nor did she discus the movie ’ s internet troll or Ms. Larson ’ s call for more diversity in Hollywood . Instead she focused solely on Captain Marvel and her alter ego Carol Danvers , a United States Air Force pilot , played by Ms. Larson .
 “ Carol changed my life and this movie hasn ’ t even come out yet , ” Ms. Larson said , a she held back tear .
 Red carpet interview from the premiere were streamed live for fan who could not attend . And the show wa a slickly produced a any pre-awards festivity , albeit one that edged toward camp at time . ( For starter , Ms. Cink ’ s co-host interviewed a cat , one of several that played Goose in the movie . )
 Ms. Cink is an employee of Marvel Studios , which produced Captain Marvel . And if there is any question why the studio would air the red carpet live , consider this : The live stream ha been watched more than 485,000 time on YouTube alone .
 Fans today clamor for anything related to their favorite movie and television franchise . As a result , live-streaming from the red carpet is not just for the Oscars anymore . More studio are producing their own red carpet extravaganza , hiring battalion of brand-friendly host to market the studio ’ s offering and control social medium messaging . And with technology that make live-steaming easy , new player have joined the fray to take advantage of the summer blockbuster season and it worldwide audience .
 “ Movie premiere have become global moment , ” said Doug Neil , Universal Pictures executive vice president for digital marketing . “ Fans like to feel like they are part of the experience . ”
 Mr. Neil would know . Last year the studio held only one premiere in London for “ Mamma Mia ! Here We Go Again. ” With an army of Academy Award winner on the red carpet — including Meryl Streep , Colin Firth , Tom Hanks and Cher — the event would be difficult for Universal to reproduce elsewhere , he said . Premieres are expensive , too , sometimes costing $ 100,000 or more . So the festivity in London were live-streamed on Facebook , where they were viewed more than 451,000 time around the world .
 “ The talent bench wa so deep , ” Mr. Neil said of the celebrity who attended . “ And Facebook ha our largest community of fans. ” With streaming technology , he added , “ It ’ s very easy to flip a switch . ”
 The quality , though , can depend on whose hand is on the switch . “ When we started doing this , it wa iPhones on tripod , ” said Alison Hoffman , chief marketing officer for the cable channel Starz . Now , she said , the company team up with medium outlet , like Entertainment Weekly , People and Entertainment Tonight , to host live stream red carpet event . That wa the case last June at the premiere of “ Power ” at Radio City Music Hall in Manhattan . The channel broadcast a live stream with three video camera .
 “ For the right show , it ’ s a critical part of the mix , ” Ms. Hoffman said .
 That is not always the case , though . Last week , the cast of “ Game of Thrones ” gathered at Radio City Music Hall for the final red carpet premiere for the beloved HBO show . The spectacle wa broadcast live by NowThis , a social medium content company , which streamed unscripted , raw footage from the “ Game of Thrones ” press line . An HBO executive said the company wa neither involved in nor aware of the live stream , which explains why it had none of the polish of a typical HBO affair .
 Photographers could be heard booing when Sophie Turner , who play Sansa Stark , invited Joe Jonas , her pop star fiancé , to join her on the red carpet . “ How about a kiss ? ” a man shouted at Lisa Bonet , the wife of Jason Momoa , who delighted a the he-man Khal Drogo in Season 1 . Ms. Bonet shook her head no ; her husband wa visibly annoyed .
 The video itself wa sketchy , too . The camera shook and the Wi-Fi wa unreliable . Gwendoline Christie looked fetching in a flowing yellow gown until she waved her silken sleeve and the screen disappeared into a haze of pixelated square . Still , the live stream ha been watched more than 188,000 time on YouTube .
 “ It ’ s not always the best quality that get the most eyeball , ” said Tina Exarhos , the chief content officer of NowThis . “ When you are on a red carpet , these are the moment you look for . ”
 Despite the video ’ s raw quality , she added , “ We are looking to do more and more of these with studio . ”
 The Walt Disney Studios , which oversees Lucasfilm , Marvel Studios , Pixar and it own slate of movie , ha the most sophisticated live-streaming operation in Hollywood . Lylle Breier , who oversees premiere and special event for the studio , said there were often multiple host — some on stage , others on the red carpet — and several camera used for interview .
 The movie that attract the most attention are the “ Star Wars ” and Marvel franchise . Last April ’ s red carpet premiere for “ Avengers : Infinity War , ” for example , ha been watched 7.28 million time . There , Gwyneth Paltrow plugged her company , Goop . ( “ She did a Goop detox and she ’ s fine , ” she said of her stressed-out character , Pepper Potts . ) Ms. Paltrow also admitted to never having watched an “ Avengers ” movie .
 As many a 30 people are hired to produce a live-streamed red carpet show for a Disney company premiere . And host , like Ms. Cink , have job mostly because they are fan . “ They do not ask reporter-type question , ” Ms. Breier said .
 Ms. Cink ha hosted at least six streaming red carpet premiere and writes all her own question . She copped to being flustered by only one celebrity : Stan Lee , the force behind Marvel Comics . ( Mr. Lee died in November , and “ Captain Marvel ” carry a dedication to him , a well a a montage of his movie cameo in the Marvel logo . )
 Her background in improvisational theater is helpful , she said . Once her earpiece quit working during a live shot , which made it impossible to hear .
 “ I looked like a deer in the headlight , ” she said . “ I screamed my intro . I know I looked , like , cuckoo banana . And it wa completely live . I wa kicking off the whole show . ”

 TEL AVIV , Israel — Last year , Shir Katzenell made a drastic life change , leaving a prestigious job in the Israeli army to pursue a childhood dream : becoming a mermaid .
 Ever since getting hooked on Disney 's `` The Little Mermaid '' a a kid , Katzenell confided , she ha longed to turn into one . While her friend moved on , Katzenell 's enchantment with mermaid endured . She fantasized about swimming underwater alongside fish in a 10-pound tail and sequined bikini . Then she actually gave it a try .
 As it turn out , she 's not the only one .
 Together with a friend and fellow mermaid-fan , Michelle Koretsky , she started an unlikely social scene : a group of aspiring mermaid in Israel , which ha grown on Facebook to nearly 1,000 member . It 's the Israeli pocket of a worldwide community that she claim is gaining prominence .
 `` It wa a crazy revelation , '' said Katzenell . `` I realized I wa part of something big . ''
 Now , a a 34-year-old `` full-time mermaid , '' she sell brightly-colored tail , some with dizzying $ 800 price tag , and teach people the skill of swimming in them .
 The tail-clad group convenes regularly to romp in public pool across the country and participate in demonstration to raise awareness about ocean preservation .
 `` Some come because they 're just interested or feel a special connection to the water . Others because they really dream of becoming mermaid , '' Katzenell said . `` They 've often been embarrassed , told they were weird or crazy . But here they can find people who understand them . ''
 On a recent night at a Tel Aviv pool , dozen of mermaid enthusiast slipped on their shimmering skin . Huddled on deck , they chatted about the latest development in mermaid culture , including `` The Little Mermaid '' remake release date , silicone tail cost and relevant book recommendation . They glided through the water and splashed around , their glittery tail slapping against the surface .
 One of the clan 's few mer-men , Yuval Avrami , marveled at how his fabric fin flitted in the water , describing it a a `` dream come true . '' He said he learned about the trend through transgender friend and became fascinated by `` the transition from one specie to another , the ability to inhabit a new , magical identity . ''
 Another member , an aerobics instructor named Udi Frige , said he had been swimming in the sea with his leg pressed together for decade , imitating mermaid choreography from the hit movie `` Splash . ''
 Frige , 39 , compared confessing his mermaid obsession to coming out in the LGBT community . `` It 's my thing , it 's unique , it 's who I am , '' he said . `` It requires lot of difficult explanation , especially if people do n't know me . ''
 For others , it 's just a source of innocent joy .
 `` When I 'm flying through the water with my tail , I forget all my worry , '' said Koretsky , the community co-leader . `` For that second , I 'm a child again . I 'm free . ''

 It wa supposed to be another one of those glittery New York night for Richard Plepler , with a screening of a new HBO documentary followed by a dinner party at Porter House , a spacious steak restaurant with a view of Central Park . But Mr. Plepler , the HBO chief executive , who announced his resignation on Thursday , wa not among the roughly 200 filmmaker , screenwriter , journalist and HBO employee who filed in around 9:30 .
 As the guest made their way to their table , a few cast glance at a conspicuous sign — a literal sign — of what had happened . There , at a front-and-center table set with glowing candle , bouquet of yellow rose and untouched salad , wa a name card that read RICHARD PLEPLER .
 This wa the power table . Every seat wa empty .
 Mr. Plepler , an urbane alpha-executive at ease among writer and politician , had decided that the network where he had spent 27 year — the last six a it top bos — wa no longer the place for him . He plan to stay at the company another month or so , likely through the final premiere of “ Game of Thrones , ” which is entering it last season , at Radio City Music Hall in April .
 At some point after AT & T absorbed HBO a part of it $ 85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner last year , Mr. Plepler sensed that his ability to run his own shop with his usual swaggering independence wa not going to fly under his Dallas-based boss , two people with knowledge of his thinking said .
 Last month , the telecommunication company entered into talk with Robert Greenblatt , a former chairman of NBC entertainment , for a high-level position at Warner Media , the medium division of AT & T that includes TBS , TNT , CNN and HBO . Mr. Greenblatt ha worked in premium cable before , having been in charge of entertainment at Showtime during it “ Dexter ” and “ Weeds ” period , from 2003 to 2010 .
 Lavish party and premiere — a coin of the realm in Los Angeles and New York — were a hallmark of Mr. Plepler ’ s tenure . There were the big-budget red-carpet premiere for “ Game of Thrones ” and more intimate dinner for the prestige documentary . And while the trapping were the same a usual on Thursday night at Porter House , the mood wa more like that of a wake . The Plepler regime wa done , and the AT & T team , with it ambition of bundling HBO into it main business , wa ascendant .
 At Porter House , Graydon Carter , the former editor of Vanity Fair and the sort of establishment figure who tended to stay close to Mr. Plepler ’ s side , surveyed the scene . “ If you look around this room , they worship him , ” he said of the absent executive ’ s staff .
 Like others in the intersecting medium and entertainment circle of Manhattan and Hollywood , Mr. Carter said the status quo would not hold , now that AT & T hadsignaled that , for the time being , it wa not going to operate the network in a hands-off manner .
 “ Richard will be mourned by the people here , and HBO will change , ” Mr. Carter said . “ Don ’ t underestimate the effect this will have . ”
 The filmmaker Alex Gibney — whose latest work , “ The Inventor , ” about the failure of the much-hyped medical start-up Theranos , wa the documentary being feted — described Mr. Plepler a a “ great impresario ” a he spoke of him in the past tense .
 “ It wasn ’ t just showbiz with Richard , ” Mr. Gibney said at Porter House . “ It ’ s sort of like : How do you trumpet the horn in a way that let people know that this is important , that you should watch , and attention must be paid ? That ’ s what Richard wa great at . He wa also great at nurturing talent . I mean , I loved him for that . ”
 In interview on Friday , some producer and television executive cautioned that the departure of an executive beloved by many may not have such a dramatic effect on HBO . Mr. Plepler , they noted , did not invent HBO ’ s culture or it programming philosophy . And however much he made himself the public face of HBO , the network , which win score of Emmys every year and make $ 2 billion in profit , will go forward .
 Several high-profile project that have already gotten the green light — including a “ Game of Thrones ” prequel , a science fiction series from the heavyweight producer-director J. J. Abrams and a comic-book adaptation from the TV auteur Damon Lindelof — are on their way .
 The tumult at Warner Media is a result of the widespread notion that a boutique premium cable channel may not represent the future in an industry upended by the deep-pocketed digital company Netflix , Amazon , Hulu and Apple , which have forced Hollywood to sell show and film directly to consumer .
 The departure of one independent-minded executive amount to a small event in a larger drama that ha forced traditional medium and entertainment company to rethink how they do business . As part of this continuing story , Comcast and the Walt Disney Company engaged in a bidding war last year to win the bulk of Rupert Murdoch ’ s medium empire , 21st Century Fox . This duel of corporate giant wa really a battle for survival , with both company realizing the need for a streaming service and content arsenal that would allow them to fend off new rival . Disney eventually won out , at a price of $ 71.3 billion , but Comcast still ha plan for a streaming service of it own .
 When AT & T announced it acquisition of Time Warner , the telecommunication company described plan to marry it voluminous subscriber data with Time Warner ’ s million of viewer to sell targeted advertising , which fetch higher rate than ad that reach a generic assortment of consumer . The company also said it would tap it Warner Media property — HBO , Turner Broadcasting and the Warner Bros. movie studio — to generate new form of video for mobile device .
 A clue about a possible strategy became public in 2017 when Randall Stephenson , the chief executive of AT & T , said at a conference : “ It will cause Plepler at HBO to panic when I say this , but can you begin to think about thing like ‘ Game of Thrones , ’ a an example , where , in a mobile environment , a 60-minute episode may not be the best experience ? Should you think about 20-minute episode ? ”
 Three people at AT & T , who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussion , said the company believed that a shift in strategy required new leadership at Warner Media ’ s network . In addition to the departure of Mr. Plepler , David Levy , the president of the Turner division , announced on Friday that he wa stepping down after 32 year at the company . AT & T ’ s acquisition of Time Warner also meant consolidating operation across various department , such a legal , accounting and human resource .
 John Stankey , who became the chief executive of Warner Media at the time of the merger , ha occasionally irked executive because of his sometimes opaque communication style , according to four people familiar with the company . When Mr. Stankey announced the leadership team for Warner Media ’ s streaming business , some of the top leader at the business unit were not aware of the appointment until the news release hit the wire , the people said .
 Mr. Stankey , who declined to comment for this article , ha changed course in recent month , sending out regular communiqués . But how budget may change is still a question for many division , the people said .
 Warner Media will most likely not get a spending boost for at least another year . AT & T ’ s top priority is tackling it debt load of $ 171 billion , much more than most public company carry . The company borrowed $ 40 billion to finance the Time Warner acquisition , and it pay out a dividend that cost $ 14 billion a year .
 Mr. Stephenson , the chief executive , ha said the company will easily pay off about $ 30 billion of the debt from it profit , along with the sale of some asset . The company ha been talking to the Walt Disney Company about selling it 10 percent stake in the streaming service Hulu , which could fetch nearly $ 1 billion . The company also owns extensive real estate that could be put up for sale .
 The acquisition of Time Warner wa a way for AT & T to set itself apart from Verizon , T-Mobile and Sprint . Those major cellular service provider have been locked in a price war for year . Most people in the United States already pay for mobile service , and the wireless carrier have had to lower price to steal customer away from one another . That ha reduced profit and encouraged them to merge with rival or venture into new territory .
 The addition of Time Warner allows AT & T to offer product like HBO and other video service , either at discounted rate or a part of a package , to keep customer from defecting .
 In June , right after AT & T closed it purchase of Warner Media , Mr. Stankey told HBO employee that the network would have to produce more show and film , and that it should keep in mind that this content should keep eye on screen for longer period of time .
 That tension — between HBO ’ s identity a a place for carefully crafted series and AT & T ’ s ambition — wa a point of discussion at the Porter House party .
 “ You understand that thing have to change , ” Mr. Gibney , the documentary filmmaker , said . “ The part that I ’ m concerned about is that the ability to be a curator of really high-quality stuff seems not to be a important . ”
 And what will become of the high-priced party ?
 Mr. Carter , the former Vanity Fair editor a well a a producer of Mr. Gibney ’ s new documentary , wa referring to Mr. Plepler when he spoke of the value of such gathering . “ Richard call them halo event , ” he said . “ They ’ re very important . If someone make a film with HBO , they know it ’ s going to get noticed , and they feel like they ’ re being acknowledged . ”
 After the guest had finished their steak and three-berry shortcake dessert , the room began to empty out . At 11:33 p.m. , a waiter in a white jacket made his final round . He barely broke stride a he swooped in and removed Mr. Plepler ’ s name card .

 When “ Captain Marvel ” open next Friday , it will be a moment of great satisfaction mixed with lingering frustration .
 The film , which star Brie Larson a that spacefaring comic-book superhero , is the 21st entry in the interconnected Marvel movie franchise since it began in 2008 but only the first to focus principally on a woman .
 By now , audience have grown accustomed to superhero movie that put woman in the spotlight . In 2017 , “ Wonder Woman , ” based on DC Comics ’ Amazonian warrior , wa a worldwide hit for Warner Bros .
 Marvel ha built it own fortune on a decades-old supply of costumed adventurer that doesn ’ t lack for woman . And the studio ha been criticized for it slowness to create movie emphasizing it female character .
 So what took Marvel a long a it did to reach this point ? And will “ Captain Marvel ” be the movie that make good on this long unfulfilled potential ?
 [ Mar-Vell explained . | Meet the cat who played Goose in the movie . ]
 The answer to the first question , at least , lie in a tangle of social , cultural and economic factor . They parallel similar issue that Marvel ha faced in making stride toward female representation in it comic book over the past 60 year — effort that gradually helped bring Captain Marvel to prominence in the publisher ’ s pantheon and make the movie more likely .
 The people behind “ Captain Marvel ” — the movie a well a the comic book that inspired it — acknowledge the problematic history that led to these more welcome development .
 They also see opportunity for woman to have an equal place on the page and on the screen , and for the Captain Marvel character to grow a an icon of female representation and empowerment .
 “ What Captain Marvel needed to be when she debuted in the 1960s is very different than what she need to be in 2019 , when she ’ s anchoring a major film , ” said Kelly Thompson , the current author of the Captain Marvel comic book series . “ The film ha her poised to be more important to more people than ever , and comic get to be the proving ground for the character . ”
 Marvel , the Disney-owned home of the Avengers superteam , ha become an important bellwether of diversity in Hollywood . The studio ha broken ground with film like “ Black Panther , ” it 2018 blockbuster with a black director , screenwriter and leading actor .
 In recent year Marvel ha also gained a reputation for giving opportunity to filmmaker who don ’ t have a background in tentpole action movie . That category includes the “ Captain Marvel ” director Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck , who are better known for low-budget offering like “ Mississippi Grind ” and “ It ’ s Kind of a Funny Story . ”
 Recalling an early meeting with Marvel , Boden said they told the studio , “ All we have is the character stuff . And they said , ‘ We know how to explode thing — we need director who can tell a story . ’ ”
 ( “ Captain Marvel , ” written by Boden , Fleck and Geneva Robertson-Dworet , is also the first Marvel movie to have a female director and only the second , after 2014 ’ s “ Guardians of the Galaxy , ” to credit woman a screenwriter . )
 Larson , an Academy Award winner for the 2015 drama “ Room , ” said she wa initially wary when she wa approached for “ Captain Marvel ” and unsure if she wanted to take on such a high-profile role .
 But the actress , who ha called for greater participation by woman and people of color in the film industry and in the medium covering it , said the global rollout of “ Captain Marvel ” could help bring her advocacy to a wider audience .
 She said she felt invested in the moral lesson of her smaller film like “ Short Term 12. ” But when it came to “ Captain Marvel , ” Larson said she asked herself , “ Could I still do the same thing of caring about the content and making sure it ha a message while also playing all over the world ? Being able to shape the conversation is what female leadership look like . ”
 In Captain Marvel ’ s favor , Larson said that while other Marvel hero are weak and lowly at the start of their origin story , “ she wa a badass before she got her power . ”
 A former Air Force test pilot named Carol Danvers , she gain superhuman ability from an alien race , and Boden described the movie a a mystery of sort in which Danvers must investigate her own past .
 “ As she get to know herself and embrace what make her her , she really achieves her true power , ” Boden said . “ Part of that mean rejecting the voice of people who tell her she ’ s not strong enough and doesn ’ t belong . I feel like a lot of people will be able to relate to that , particularly woman . ”

 THE CHARACTER OF CAROL DANVERS ha been on a journey of her own since Marvel introduced her in the comic in 1968 . At the time , she wa not much more than a Lois Lane-type love interest for a male hero ( an extraterrestrial soldier who wa the publisher ’ s original Captain Marvel ) .
 Marvel , where it audacious editor Stan Lee led a roster of talented writer and illustrator , wa celebrated in that era for it inclusivity . But it earliest effort at female representation can now seem like tokenism .
 “ You can ’ t help but think that if Stan Lee wasn ’ t a conscious sexist , he certainly wa so traditional , ” said Heidi MacDonald , editor of The Beat , a comic culture website . “ He gave his female character the weakest power — ‘ Oh , I can get very small. ’ ‘ I can turn invisible. ’ ‘ I can move a teacup with my mind . ’ ”
 In the 1970s and ’ 80 , Marvel put out it first solo female superhero comic and introduced Spider-Woman and She-Hulk , gender-swapped version of it best-known character who were intended , in part , to protect the publisher ’ s copyright .
 In a nod to the growing feminist movement , Marvel transformed Danvers into Ms. Marvel , giving her a solo series in which she battled intergalactic villain and wore a navel-baring costume .
 The character would go in and out of vogue over the year , a period when many woman would drift away from comic . The publication became harder to find at bookstore and newsstand , and female reader were alienated by sexist story line and artwork that reduced woman to sidekick and stereotype .
 “ In the ’ 80 and ’ 90 , we made comic that were actively insulting to woman , ” the writer Kelly Sue DeConnick said . “ Women left in drove . Because why are you going to read stuff that ’ s actively insulting to you , that you have to get at a specialty store where you ’ re not always welcome ? ”
 DeConnick sought to counteract this when she reintroduced Carol Danvers in a 2012 series in which the character finally assumed the title of Captain Marvel and donned a jumpsuit more appropriate to her military background .
 In the preceding year , DeConnick said , “ she had gone from wearing a gymnast ’ s leotard with thigh boot to a thong . It wa the most disingenuous thing in the world . ”
 DeConnick , whose father served in the Air Force for 20 year , said she wanted to inscribe Danvers in the tradition of the pilot ace she ’ d long admired .
 “ I grew up on Air Force base and have a real soft spot for the history of aviation , ” DeConnick said . Citing pilot like Pappy Boyington and Chuck Yeager , she added , “ You can have swagger and you can still be military . ”
 At the same time , female reader were returning to comic , encouraged by new publication format and more inclusive plot and character .
 The revitalized Carol Danvers had become a central player in Marvel ’ s comic universe , and the publisher successfully introduced a diverse array of character like a young new Spider-Man , Miles Morales , who is of black and Puerto Rican descent , and a new Ms. Marvel , Kamala Khan , who is a Muslim teenager .
 Most crucially , said Thompson , the current Captain Marvel author , “ Marvel put their support behind these character . You have to put good talent on their book , but you have to support and advertise for them and push them a premier character . Let ’ s not ignore that part of the equation . ”

 MARVEL ’ S MOVIES , HOWEVER , DID NOT KEEP PACE . The studio ’ s earliest release were focused on establishing core male hero like Iron Man , Captain America and Thor ; though it cinematic universe had included female character like Black Widow ( played by Scarlett Johansson ) and the Scarlet Witch ( Elizabeth Olsen ) a member of larger team , there were no solo film in development for them .
 Even Marvel seemed prey to a longstanding Hollywood fallacy that while woman will watch movie about men , men will not watch movie about woman . “ Because woman are low-status in our culture , ” DeConnick said , “ you will aspire up , you will not cross-identify down . ”
 That perception of the studio appeared to be reinforced by the leak of a 2014 email from Isaac Perlmutter , the chairman of Marvel Entertainment , in which he disparaged female superhero film like “ Supergirl ” ( 1984 ) , “ Catwoman ” ( 2004 ) and “ Elektra ” ( 2005 ) for their poor box-office performance .
 Similarly , when the Marvel studio wa reorganized in 2015 , allowing it president , Kevin Feige , to report directly to Disney and sidestep Perlmutter , industry observer assumed that this gave Feige the freedom to pursue more diverse movie like “ Black Panther ” and “ Captain Marvel. ” ( Marvel and Disney declined to comment on this . )
 Boden and Fleck , the “ Captain Marvel ” director , said it wa difficult to escape the grip of Hollywood tradition , in which most genre movie still focus on male lead .
 “ Even looking at our own film , why did it take u five film to have one about a female protagonist ? ” Fleck said . “ Hopefully we get to the point where these story are being told all the time . ”
 Asked what conclusion he and Boden had reached by reflecting on their own body of work , Fleck replied , “ We haven ’ t arrived at the insight yet . I think they ’ re coming though . ”
 For all of the unresolved question that “ Captain Marvel ” raise , MacDonald , the Beat editor , said that Marvel still deserved credit for getting the movie produced and generating enthusiasm for the character .
 “ There ’ s definitely a lot of history that they had to buck to get ‘ Captain Marvel ’ made , ” she said . “ They built a real basis for this character and a passion for what she stood for ” a well a a fan base that is “ very powerful . ”
 She added , “ Is it million and million of people ? No , it isn ’ t . But it doesn ’ t need to be . It need to be that core , that spark . ”
 There is no expectation that “ Captain Marvel ” will match the monumental box-office result of last year ’ s “ Black Panther , ” which grossed $ 1.3 billion worldwide , or “ Avengers : Infinity War , ” which took in $ 2 billion globally and ended on a catastrophic cliffhanger that fan have waited almost a year to see resolved . By comparison , Marvel ’ s “ Ant-Man and the Wasp , ” a summer 2018 release that starred Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly , had global gross of $ 622 million .
 Recent tracking report estimate that “ Captain Marvel ” will bring in more than $ 100 million in it opening weekend , and MacDonald said the movie will probably appeal to multiple constituency : not only fan of the character and woman who want to watch female-led film , but also Marvel obsessive who want to see how it tie into Marvel ’ s next battle royale , “ Avengers : Endgame , ” which open April 26 .
 “ Kevin Feige is very smart , ” MacDonald said . “ He ’ s releasing the movie that would be the hardest sell in a position where it ’ s going to lead into the greatest final act in movie history . ”
 It ’ s unclear whether “ Captain Marvel ” will be the start of a trend or an outlier for Marvel . Hollywood trade publication have reported that the studio is preparing other female-led project , including a Black Widow movie , starring Johansson and directed by Cate Shortland ( “ Lore ” ) , and a film adaptation of the Eternals , directed by Chloé Zhao ( “ The Rider ” ) . But Disney said it could not confirm Marvel ’ s development slate .
 Whether “ Captain Marvel ” can be a harbinger for other movie like it , Larson said , “ is a larger question , a systemic thing . ”
 “ That change is scary , ” she said , “ and it take time for it to come . It ’ s slow but it ’ s happening . ”
 The only way such progress can happen , Larson said , is if she and her peer use the influence afforded by movie like “ Captain Marvel ” to strive for further change and to make them permanent .
 “ Part of why I ’ m pushing really hard now is because I do have a little bit of power , and I ’ m going to use it , ” she said . “ You don ’ t know when it ’ s going to shift again or who ’ s going to have the power next . But I ’ ll push it a far a I can . Because it ’ s the right thing to do . ”
 An earlier version of this article misstated the kind of boot Captain Marvel wore before the character wa reintroduced in 2012 . In the preceding year , she wore thigh boot , not side boot . The earlier version also misstated which branch of the military Pappy Boyington served in . It wa the Marines , not the Air Force .

 LOS ANGELES — Voting for the 91st Academy Awards end on Tuesday , with roughly 8,200 movie industry insider using a private website to mark their choice . Just what go through their mind when they point and click ?
 In a perfect world , each voter would approach the task with solemnity , taking time to watch all of the nominated film and putting aside bias to consider the degree of artistry onscreen .
 But Hollywood is no utopia .
 To a large degree , Oscar voting is about personal prejudice and petty grievance . ( Just read the anonymous voter column The Hollywood Reporter ha published in the past . ) It is about who ha the most pal in the voting pool , which remains 69 percent male and 84 percent white despite year of diversification effort . It also involves Hollywood ’ s changing business landscape — namely , whether Netflix should be embraced by the industry or kept out of the club for a long a possible , regardless of the quality of the film it serf up .
 So , a an experiment , I called 20 academy member ( none directly associated with any of this year ’ s nominee ) and asked for utter candor : How are you evaluating the eight candidate for best picture ?
 None would speak for attribution , but their answer said a lot about the Oscars in particular and Hollywood in general . ( High school with much , much more money , indeed . ) Below is an amalgamation of their comment .
 One vinegary older voter compared superhero film to “ the stuff that ooze out of dumpster behind fast-food restaurants. ” Then he confessed that he hadn ’ t yet seen “ Black Panther . ”
 Eek .
 But many of the people I called said they would place this comic-book blockbuster near the top of their ballot — citing it commanding performance , sumptuous production design and overall cultural importance . ( The academy us a complicated “ preferential ” voting system for best picture , in which nominee are ranked 1 through 8 , and the second- and third-place position can carry a much weight a first place . )
 The problem , at least for a few voter : “ Black Panther ” wa made by Marvel , which is owned by Disney , which ha turned every other studio into a box office also-ran . It will be even worse when Disney completes it takeover of 20th Century Fox . “ And now we ’ re also supposed to give Disney the Oscar for best picture ? ” one voter from a rival studio told me .
 Directed by Spike Lee , “ BlacKkKlansman ” drew praise for it originality and intellectual heft . As one person put it , “ BlacKkKlansman ” is the kind of film that hold up in the history book . There will be no “ Did we really vote for this ? ” regret in a couple of year . ( See : “ Shakespeare in Love . ” )
 On the downside , movie that win best picture usually connect with voter on an emotional level . At least in my little sample , “ BlacKkKlansman ” fell more into the “ deeply admire but don ’ t feel the need to watch it again ” zone .
 Lee could be the ceremony ’ s best hope for a viral moment , however . Some people relished the idea of his striding onto the Oscar stage and excoriating studio for sidelining minority . ( He ’ s never been one to mince word . ) “ Can you imagine ? ” said a voter who is a member of the academy ’ s writer branch . “ People would have to be hauled out on stretchers. ” ( Lee is also nominated for best director for the first time in his singular career . )
 This Queen biopic , directed by Bryan Singer ( at least until he wa fired for erratic behavior ) , rank a one of the more puzzling best picture contender in memory . ( And that ’ s saying something , considering that the talking-pig movie “ Babe ” wa a contender in 1996 . ) Voters used word like “ superficial ” and “ messy ” to describe the film , which received lukewarm review from critic and prompted an outcry for soft-pedaling gay plot point .
 Almost everyone admitted that “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” wa a guilty pleasure to watch , however , a Rami Malek turned in an Oscar-worthy performance a Freddie Mercury . ( All 20 people I contacted said Malek had their vote for best actor . )
 In a surprise — or not , given the way that Hollywood like to sweep problem under the rug — most voter said they would not hold Singer ’ s involvement against the film . The director ha long been trailed by accusation of sexual misconduct and new claim about sex with underage boy that surfaced in The Atlantic the day after Oscar nomination were announced . Singer denied wrongdoing and labeled the article “ a homophobic smear piece . ”
 Voters like being on the winning team . And this dark comedy set in the court of Queen Anne ( circa 1710 ) , while widely admired for it performance , script and costume , ha mostly been a loser at the big pre-Oscar ceremony . “ I love this nasty little movie , but I don ’ t want to throw my vote away , ” one person told me , adding that she wa waiting until the British Academy of Film and Television Arts award to make her decision . ( “ The Favourite ” won seven Baftas on Sunday , but lost the big prize to “ Roma . ” )
 Others seemed unsure whether “ The Favourite ” sent a positive message about woman ( Olivia Colman , Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz lead the cast ) or ultimately reinforces a “ Mean Girls ” stereotype ( they scheme , double-cross and manipulate ) .
 Nobody thought this period segregation comedy wa perfect . Could we please have a touch of nuance ? And that fried-chicken scene make everyone cringe . But “ Green Book ” tugged hard on a lot of voter heartstrings . One producer in his late 60 said the movie ’ s feel-good ending made him “ absolutely melt . ”
 Peter Farrelly , who directed “ Green Book ” and wa one of it writer , ha also proved to be an effective campaigner , a couple of voter noted , with his self-effacing speech at the Producers Guild Awards in January a Exhibit A . “ When you make ‘ Dumb and Dumber , ’ you never expect to get an award , ” Farrelly said , referring to one of his early film . “ I ’ m damn thankful . ”
 One voter , a studio executive in his 50 , admitted that his support for “ Green Book ” wa rooted in rage . He said he wa tired of being told what movie to like and not like . ( Much of the public debate about “ Green Book ” ha turned on it handling of racial issue , which some see a woefully retrograde and borderline bigoted . )
 Directed by Alfonso Cuarón and distributed by Netflix , “ Roma ” seems to be prompting a crisis of conscience .
 Do we vote for “ Roma ” because we think it ’ s the best ? Or do we withhold our support — regardless of the film ’ s artistic merit — because we see Netflix a a threat to moviegoing ? Although the company pushed “ Roma ” into about 250 independent theater in the United States , on par with many foreign-language release , the streaming giant mostly bypass cinema . There are voter in both camp . A couple of those in the anti-Netflix group told me that they would vote for Cuarón for best director a a way to assuage their guilt .
 The chief complaint about “ Roma ” involved it leisurely pace . One voter in the acting branch described the period black-and-white film a important but boring .
 It ’ s a long , bumpy road to the Oscars . And this blockbuster remake — a front-runner for best picture late last year — went kerplop somewhere along the way .
 Some voter said they lost their zeal for “ A Star Is Born ” after the film converted only one of it five Golden Globe nomination into a win ( best song ) . Others faulted Lady Gaga , who play the main role , for giving speech on the award trail ( the Globes , National Board of Review ) that struck them a cloying . A few older voter said they had gone back to watch the 1954 version of “ A Star Is Born , ” with Judy Garland , and come away with the belief that the current version wasn ’ t a good , especially in it second hour .
 “ The new one is a masterpiece — for 40 minute , ” one producer told me .

 The S & P 500 crossed the 2,900 mark for the first time since early October on Friday , boosted by a jump in Walt Disney share and a bank stock surged after strong result from JPMorgan Chase & Co .
 The stock index 's recent gain spell a striking reversal in fortune for investor , who just a few month ago had been staring at the demise of the longest bull market for stock .

 The amount of time for the S & P 500 to regain the high from the start of the cyclical correction within a secular bull market average 15.4 month , according to BofA Merrill Lynch data .
 `` If 2351 from 12/24 prof to be the correction low on the S & P 500 , this suggests that the S & P 500 could achieve a new high in January 2020 given the start of the correction in September , '' the BofA analyst said .

 In Hollywood , the circle of life ha it own meaning . As evidenced by this week ’ s most interesting trailer , studio keep returning to property that worked in the past . Here ’ s the new crop , ranked from most to least derivative .
 The second promotional clip for Disney ’ s remake doesn ’ t answer the question raised by the initial teaser in November , like : If it ’ s computer-animated , what set it apart from the original cartoon ? Is it a musical ? ( It is , although oddly only a snippet of “ The Lion Sleeps Tonight ” can be heard at the trailer ’ s end . ) And what do Donald Glover and Beyoncé Knowles-Carter sound like a Simba and Nala ? Sorry , but we ’ re not quite feeling the love for this one yet .
 Technically , this thriller from Luc Besson is a piece of original intellectual property , but it appears eerily reminiscent of the director ’ s “ La Femme Nikita ” ( 1990 ) and “ Léon : The Professional ” ( 1994 ) , which also both followed young woman trained to be assassin . ( In this case , the title role is played by Sasha Luss , a model raised in Moscow . ) It also look a lot like “ Hanna ” — the 2011 film directed by Joe Wright that Amazon recently turned into a series — not to mention the Jennifer Lawrence movie “ Red Sparrow ” and the Jennifer Garner TV drama “ Alias. ” In the trailer , Anna is compared to a Russian doll , and this similarly seems like a copy of a copy of a … you get the point .
 “ Every family is different , but some family are more different than others , ” the narrator note in the first trailer for the animated film inspired by Charles Addams ’ s New Yorker cartoon . Scored with the ’ 60 sitcom version ’ s finger-snapping theme , the spot doesn ’ t promise a fresh take on the material , aside from a sly inside joke a Morticia ( Charlize Theron ) observes of a red balloon , “ Strange , there ’ s usually a murderous clown attached to the end of these. ” Finn Wolfhard , the “ Stranger Things ” actor who also appeared in the clown shocker “ It , ” voice son Pugsley , and the ensemble also includes Oscar Isaac ( father Gomez ) , Chloë Grace Moretz ( daughter Wednesday ) and Nick Kroll ( Uncle Fester ) .
 As in “ The Big Sick , ” Kumail Nanjiani play an Uber driver , but that ’ s the only parallel between his Oscar-nominated 2017 rom-com and this pedal-to-the-metal action comedy . Nanjiani ’ s hence-the-title character , Stu , pick up a Los Angeles cop ( “ Guardians of the Galaxy ” behemoth Dave Bautista ) and find himself in hot pursuit of a murderer . The odd-couple setup feel a bit hackneyed , but if the film ’ s gag are a clever a the trailer ’ s tagline , “ Prepare for the Rideshare of Your Life , ” “ Stuber ” could earn a five-star rating .
 Director-co-star Amy Poehler cast a bevy of fellow “ Saturday Night Live ” veteran ( Maya Rudolph , Rachel Dratch , Ana Gasteyer and Tina Fey a well a writer Paula Pell and Emily Spivey ) in this boozy comedy about a group of woman who travel to the Napa Valley for a 50th-birthday party . With it mix of physical shtick and raunchy one-liner ( “ I did Molly in college , but she went back to her boyfriend ” ) , the rollicking trailer for “ Wine Country ” suggests a middle-aged “ Bridesmaids. ” And that ’ s a trip we ’ ll happily take .

 The only new movie in the top 10 this week , Sony ’ s “ Escape Room , ” exceeded most analyst ’ expectation and landed in the No . 2 spot with $ 18 million in sale . A thriller directed by Adam Robitel , the film capitalized on the phenomenon of real-life “ escape room ” puzzle game , where player ( or corporate employee on a team-building trip ) are trapped in a room and have to complete a series of challenge to get out . “ Escape Room ” feature a deadly version . While it opening weekend sale were modest beside those of “ Aquaman , ” the $ 18 million is a win for Sony given the movie ’ s $ 9 million budget .
 There are few surprise elsewhere in the top ten . Disney ’ s “ Mary Poppins Returns ” came in third with $ 15.8 million this weekend , while Sony ’ s well-received “ Spider-Man : Into the Spider-Verse ” came in fourth , making $ 13 million according to Comscore , which compiles box office data .

 “ In shock , and in mourning ” : Reactions to the fire that ravaged the cathedral .
 To the Editor :
 Re “ Fire Mauls Paris ’ s Beloved Notre-Dame ” ( front page , April 16 ) :
 I am an architect living very close to Notre-Dame . I saw the fire and I have seen the devastation . This building ha been a fact of French civilization for more than 800 year , and the damage is shocking .
 I have no doubt that when it wa built it gave the people a sense of divine grandeur and an astonishing sense of confidence in what they can imagine and build . Though Christian faith ha waned , I am sure that the sublime skill and confidence are still there . That wa not destroyed .
 If there is any good to come of this , the French people will become reacquainted with this early act of their civilization and discover that they have all that is required to put it back together and much more .

 To the Editor :
 My heart break for Paris .
 As an 11-year-old I “ read ” ( understanding what I could , and it took month ) Victor Hugo ’ s masterpiece , “ The Hunchback of Notre-Dame. ” My obsession began after watching Disney ’ s adaptation , and flourished during a family vacation to France .
 On our first morning in Paris , my dad and I woke at dawn to be at the very front of the line when the cathedral opened . We turned the corner in the Île de la Cité , and I will never forget how the structure took my breath away ( below ) .
 That moment forever awakened in me a love of travel , art and history . I have since been to more than 50 country , and Notre-Dame is still my favorite building on this planet . I wa speechless when I first saw it , and am speechless at the tragic news . In shock , and in mourning . . .
 Emme AckermanGran Canaria , Canary Islands
 To the Editor :
 As a French-Scot I watched in horror from Scotland a Notre-Dame de Paris erupted into flame . In my St. Andrews flat , I felt an overwhelming need to be on the Île de la Cité , where I first saw this fantastic example of Gothic architecture with my French grandmother in the late 1940s after it had miraculously survived Hitler ’ s order to burn Paris . But Monday night wa for mourning .
 Today our thought turn to resurrecting this symbol of the City of Light and the French nation . President Emmanuel Macron ha already announced a national campaign to rebuild the church , kick-started by large personal donation from the wealthy , but a ever the “ widow ’ s mite ” will be far more symbolic .
 Fire threatened to destroy everything , and though much is lost , the cathedral ’ s twin tower remain . France doe not have tree big enough to replace the ancient wooden beam , but these will be sourced . Fortunately , the iconic building became such an amalgam of design across the century that restoration need not mean exact replication .

 To the Editor :
 “ A traveler in 13th-century France . . . met three men wheeling wheelbarrow . He asked in what work they were engaged and he received from them the following three answer :
 “ The first said , ‘ I toil from sunup to sundown and all I receive for my pain is a few franc a day. ’ The second said , ‘ I am glad enough to wheel this wheelbarrow for I have been out of work for many month and I have a family to support. ’ The third said , ‘ I am building Chartres Cathedral ’ ” ( Ben Shahn , “ The Shape of Content ” ) .
 The fire in Notre-Dame ha caused many , both inside and outside France , to feel not only sadness , but also a sense of participating in something greater : to reach out , in the spirit of the third man , to help rebuild this glorious building of faith and symbol of civilization .

 ( Reuters ) - Daniel Loeb 's hedge fund Third Point LLC is building a stake in Sony Corp to push for change that include shedding some business , the second time in six year it ha targeted the Japanese electronics maker , people familiar with the matter said on Monday .
 Once a market leader in consumer electronics , Sony is now in the midst of a turnaround effort spearheaded by Kenichiro Yoshida , it chief executive who formerly served at it chief financial officer .
 The maker of the iconic Walkman and Trinitron TV fell behind the like of Apple Inc in innovation after the release of the iPod in 2001 and the iPhone in 2007 . Sony over the past decade ha reinvented itself a an entertainment company with stable revenue from music content and it video game platform .
 Investors are now searching for it next source of growth a Sony 's gaming business show sign of slowing , with it popular PlayStation 4 console nearing the end of it cycle .
 Third Point 's amassed stake in Sony thus far could not be learned . The hedge fund , which ha about $ 14.5 billion in asset under management , is raising a dedicated investment vehicle , targeting between $ 500 million and $ 1 billion in capital , so it can buy more Sony share , the source said .
 Third Point want Sony to explore option for some of it business unit , including it movie studio , which the hedge fund belief ha attracted takeover interest from the like of Amazon.com Inc and Netflix Inc , the source said . The hedge fund also want clarity on how Sony 's semiconductor and insurance division fit in with the rest of the company , the source added .
 The source asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential . Sony and Third Point declined to comment .
 U.S.-listed share of Sony rose 8.3 percent after the Reuters report to close at $ 46.65 . The company , whose main stock market listing is in Tokyo , ha a market value of 6.1 trillion yen ( $ 55 billion ) .
 Sony reported lower-than-expected profit in February , dragged down by it previously thriving gaming business , even a a one-off gain related to it acquisition of music publisher EMI pushed the quarterly result to a record high .
 Third Point last exited a stake in Sony in 2014 with a roughly 20 percent gain after spending a year and a half pushing for Sony to spin off it entertainment division , writing in a letter to investor that the division remained `` poorly managed . ''
 Some Hollywood actor and producer rallied behind Sony at the time , with actor and producer George Clooney calling Loeb `` a hedge fund guy who describes himself a an activist but who know nothing about our business . ''
 Later Loeb changed his tune , praising the company for cutting cost at the entertainment division and having made management change .
 CINEMA HITS
 Sony ha already sold off it ailing personal computer division and streamlined it television and smartphone business . In taking aim at Sony 's commitment to the entertainment business , however , Third Point may be facing an uphill struggle .
 Yoshida ha said he see synergy between the film business and it PlayStation platform , and he ha been emboldened by Sony 's cinema hit such a 'Jumanji : Welcome to the Jungle , ' and 'Venom ' .
 Consolidation in the sector ha been intensifying amid pressure from online streaming service offered by company like Netflix and Amazon , and with Walt Disney Co completing it $ 71.3 billion acquisition of most of 21st Century Fox Inc 's entertainment asset from Rupert Murdoch 's medium empire last month .
 Loeb is no stranger to challenging company with long odds of success . Last year , he sought to oust the entire board of Campbell Soup Co , despite the founding family 's member controlling much of the U.S. food company . He ended up settling for two board seat .
 This is the second time Third Point is looking to increase it firepower by raising a special purpose vehicle . In 2017 , it raised $ 750 million that way to build a stake in Nestle SA .
 Sony last month said it chairman Kazuo Hirai , who helped engineer the company 's recent revival , would retire in June .

 One audience reviewer deemed the movie “ a complete disaster. ” Another wa “ tired of all this SJW nonsense , ” using the abbreviation for “ social justice warrior , ” a pejorative term for progressive . Yet another groused that Brie Larson , the movie ’ s star , “ say I shouldn ’ t see the movie anyway . ”
 “ Captain Marvel ” had not even been released yet — it opening day wa a month away — but that did not stop negative remark from piling up against the film and Ms. Larson .
 Much a Facebook and Twitter have had to grapple with false story aimed at inciting violence or disrupting election , movie review aggregator like Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb are often besieged by user trying to manipulate a film ’ s box office success .
 Despite the troll ’ concerted effort , “ Captain Marvel ” slayed during it opening weekend , but not before Rotten Tomatoes , an influential site where a bad audience score can damage a film ’ s prospect , made major change to it rule . Most critically , it eliminated prerelease audience review . It also stopped displaying the percentage of moviegoer who say they “ want to see ” a film in favor of using the raw number of people . And it removed the “ not interested ” button .
 “ We ’ re doing it to more accurately and authentically represent the voice of fan , ” the site said , “ while protecting our data and public forum from bad actor . ”
 The backlash against “ Captain Marvel ” resulted from a collision of two major force . One wa the popularity of website that at their best democratize the reviewing of movie , restaurant and business and at their worst can be weaponized for score-settling or political grudge .
 The other wa the growing movement in Hollywood toward broader gender and racial representation in film role , production job and the industry in general .
 “ Captain Marvel ” is among the few superhero film to star a woman , but a bigger trigger factor for the film ’ s hater appeared to be Ms. Larson ’ s outspokenness about the lack of diversity in movie and news medium coverage of film .
 Before the film ’ s release , Ms. Larson told “ Entertainment Tonight ” that she had spoken with Marvel about making the film “ a big feminist movie. ” In another interview , she said that after noticing that most of her interviewer in the past had been white and male , she vowed to seek out more underrepresented journalist , including Keah Brown , who is black and disabled , and who profiled her for Marie Claire .
 Ms. Larson , who won the best-actress Oscar in 2016 for her performance in “ Room , ” had previously lashed out against the homogeneity of professional film critic . “ I do not need a 40-year-old white dude to tell me what didn ’ t work for him about ‘ A Wrinkle in Time , ’ ” she said during a speech last summer . “ It wasn ’ t made for him . ”
 This all provided fodder to troll , and week ahead of “ Captain Marvel ’ s ” release , the percentage of Rotten Tomatoes user who registered that they wanted to see it plummeted to 27 percent . On Feb. 25 , Rotten Tomatoes implemented the change , and the “ want to see ” score disappeared . Since the film ’ s nationwide release on Friday , the audience score ha rebounded to a better-but-still-not-great 63 percent , the lowest for any movie in the Marvel franchise . For a while , the score had been below 60 percent , signified by a tipped-over bucket of popcorn , the symbol for a film that might be one to skip .
 The “ Tomatometer , ” which analyzes the rating from film critic , is at a “ certified fresh ” 79 percent , slightly below the average for Marvel movie . It is impossible to say whether the website ’ s change helped the film , but it made $ 456 million during it opening weekend , trouncing projection .
 A representative for Ms. Larson declined to comment , and publicist at Disney , which owns Marvel Studios , did not reply to email Tuesday .
 The film ’ s opponent also swarmed YouTube ; video rant with title like “ Brie Larson is Ruining Marvel ” often appeared at the top of search for her name . But a day before the film ’ s release , a change in the search result pushed those video beneath others from established source like Jimmy Kimmel , “ Today ” and Wired .
 A YouTube representative said the reason wa an algorithm change made last summer that reclassifies trending search topic a news . The site , which is owned by Google , took the action a part of it effort to combat fictitious content and ensure that reliable information wa highlighted .
 “ Captain Marvel ” detractor also flocked to IMDb , though a representative from that site said no one wa available to comment , and would only provide a link to the site ’ s rating and comment policy , which state that user are not allowed to rate a film before it release .
 The new Marvel movie is not the first film to come under attack for a perceived feminist or politically correct underpinning . The all-female remake of “ Ghostbusters , ” “ Black Panther ” and “ Star Wars : The Last Jedi , ” which had a diverse cast , all found themselves in the cross hair of armchair critic , some aligned with alt-right group .
 Some site pushed back . Last year , Rotten Tomatoes said it would delete comment posted from member of the Facebook group “ Down with Disney ’ s Treatment of Franchises and Its Fanboys ” if they contained hate speech . The group had posted an event called “ Give Black Panther a Rotten Audience Score on Rotten Tomatoes. ” Facebook then deactivated the group ( it ha since been revived by someone claiming to be anti-troll ) , which had also claimed responsibility for torpedoing audience score for “ Star Wars : The Last Jedi . ”
 That a movie starring Ms. Larson spurred Rotten Tomatoes into taking a bolder step wa no coincidence .
 When Ms. Larson spoke out last summer against the dominance of white male critic , she cited finding by the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative , which is run out of the University of Southern California and had singled out Rotten Tomatoes for having 3.5 men to every female critic reviewing the top film of 2017 .
 In her speech , Ms. Larson also revealed that the Sundance and Toronto film festival had each pledged to set aside one-fifth of their press pass for use by diverse journalist , including woman and people of color .
 Two and a half month later , Rotten Tomatoes threw in with Ms. Larson ’ s cause , and revamped it criterion for critic , focusing more on individual qualification than the brand and reach of a publication , to include hundred of reviewer from underrepresented group in it Tomatometer score ( a representative said the change had been in development for over a year ) . It also pledged $ 100,000 to various film festival working to diversify their press corp , in part by helping cover freelancer ’ travel and lodging cost .
 A representative for Rotten Tomatoes , Dana Benson , said the change to it audience score had been in the work for a while , but that the attack on “ Captain Marvel ” prompted them to roll it out earlier than planned .
 “ We ’ re very dedicated to making criticism more inclusive , ” Ms. Benson said . “ All the thought and care that went into the Tomatometer , we are expanding that to the audience score . ”
 Rotten Tomatoes said future change could include having “ verified ” reviewer , like the one who post on Amazon after purchasing a product . Those could come from people who bought ticket through Fandango , the movie ticket website , which owns Rotten Tomatoes .
 There wa , not unexpectedly , a flip side to the attack on “ Captain Marvel ” — people rushing to it defense , whether they had seen the movie or not .
 “ There are a large group of people that are only down-voting this movie because they somehow feel threatened by it , ” wrote one fan on Rotten Tomatoes .
 “ Imagine being so insecure , you cry about a movie with a girl a the hero , ” wrote another .
 And over on IMDb , one wrote : “ I do agree that this isn ’ t marvel ’ s best movie , but it wa a fun and enjoyable ride . I ’ m sure director and co. were hyper aware of the backlash they were facing and some of the moment seemed like tongue-in-cheek middle finger to all the hate . ”

 Remakes and cartoon — or , in the case of “ Dumbo , ” a remake of a cartoon — make up this week ’ s crop of new movie trailer . Here they are , in order from most to least promising .
 It may have the same title a the 1971 blaxploitation flick and it 2000 reboot , but the trailer for this update reveals a more comic tone . Jessie T. Usher ( “ Survivor ’ s Remorse ” ) join the cast a John Shaft Jr. , the less-than-supercool son and grandson of the Harlem P.I.s played by Samuel L. Jackson and Richard Roundtree , who both make welcome return to the franchise . Wisely using Isaac Hayes ’ Oscar-winning original score , the clip pack in gag and action . Can you dig it ? I can .
 Sometimes when studio release new international trailer , it ’ s a lot of the same footage that ’ s already been seen in American promos , slightly rearranged . But in the case of this British clip for the director Tim Burton ’ s live-action take on “ Dumbo , ” Disney ’ s animated chestnut , it ’ s almost all fresh material . Much of it focus on two veteran of Burton ’ s “ Batman Returns , ” Danny DeVito and Michael Keaton , who exhibit ( and possibly exploit ) the big-eared flying elephant . The tagline promise , “ A beloved tale will take you to new heights. ” Based on this uplifting teaser , I believe it .
 The second trailer for the new animated film from Laika , the studio behind the Oscar-nominated 2016 “ Kubo and the Two Strings , ” can ’ t seem to decide if it ’ s selling a slapstick farce or a more high-minded adventure . Zach Galifianakis voice a monster who join two explorer ( Hugh Jackman and Zoe Saldana ) on a journey to find the Yetis he belief are his cousin . Rather than Bigfoot or Sasquatch , the creature like to call itself “ Susan. ” If that make you laugh , “ Missing Link ” could be the movie for you .
 Back in October , the first trailer for this new version of Stephen King ’ s chiller didn ’ t generate much excitement , but this follow-up increase the fear factor . It also divulges more of the plot : A doctor ( Jason Clarke ) move his family to a small town , and after his daughter dy , he reanimates her at a haunted burial ground . “ They don ’ t come back the same , ” warns the film ’ s slogan , but aside from a gender switch with the demon child , this feel like the same old story that wa turned into a perfectly serviceable 1989 horror picture .
 How many pop star can you stuff into one cast ? This animated musical based on the plush-toy line try to find out , with a roster that includes Kelly Clarkson , Nick Jonas , Pitbull , Blake Shelton , Bebe Rexha , Charli XCX , Lizzo and more . But a the strained line reading by Clarkson and Shelton in the trailer demonstrate , just because you ’ ve been a coach on “ The Voice ” doesn ’ t mean you should voice a cartoon character .

 Read our update and analysis from the Golden Globes ceremony .
 Glenn Close won a Golden Globe on Sunday and it wa one of the biggest upset of the night . Her portrayal of Joan Castleman in “ The Wife ” won her a third Globe for best actress in a drama , over Lady Gaga , who wa widely expected to win for her performance in “ A Star is Born . ”
 In a tearful speech that drew many in the crowd to their foot , Close , seemingly caught off-guard when her name wa announced , implored woman to “ find personal fulfillment. ” After acknowledging the other nominee and thanking , among others , “ Meg Wolitzer for writing this incredible novel and Jane Anderson for adapting it , ” the actress said it took 14 year to make the movie . “ You know , it wa called ‘ The Wife. ’ I think that ’ s why it took 14 year to get made . ”
 She continued :
 “ To play a character is so internal . And I ’ m thinking of my mom who really sublimated herself to my father her whole life and in her 80 she said to me , “ I feel I haven ’ t accomplished anything. ” And it wa so not right and I feel what I ’ ve learned through this whole experience is that , you know , woman , we are nurturers , that ’ s what ’ s expected of u . We have our child . We have our husband if we are lucky enough , and our partner , whoever . But we have to find personal fulfillment . We have to follow our dream . We have to say , “ I can do that and I should be allowed to do that . ”
 And , you know , when I wa little , I felt like Muhammad Ali , who wa destined to be a boxer . I felt destined to be an actress . I saw all the early Disney film and Hayley Mills , and I said , “ I can do that. ” And here I am today . It will have been 45 year in September that I am a working actress . And I can not imagine a more wonderful life . Thank you Björn Runge , who is here , who directed “ The Wife , ” who trusted the close-up , who knew where to put the camera and how to light u . Jonathan Pryce , what a great partner . My daughter Annie who played the foundation of this character . I love you , my darling . Thank you so much . ”
 Here ’ s the full list of winner .

 Unmotivated ? Me too .
 By Jen A. Miller
 Welcome to the Running newsletter ! Every Saturday morning , we email runner with news , advice and some motivation to help you get up and running . Sign up here to get it in your inbox .
 On Wednesday , I put on my running gear , went to the bathroom , tucked my phone into my pocket . I wa dressed and ready to go .
 And then , I sat on my bed , looked at my dog , and said “ Annie , I would rather not . ”
 I ’ m not feeling very motivated right now . My goal race is more than two month away , the weather where I live in New Jersey ha been le than ideal , and all I see ahead are batch of mile to be run on the same road I have been running on for most of my adult life .
 These dip happen , and there are thing you can do if you ’ re in a running rut , whether your goal is to bust right out of it , or just pas the mile until the weather improves or the big race get close enough to feel in reach .
 You may laugh , but I get a lot of email and tweet from people who are struggling to run because of some stabbing pain , and want me to tell them what to do so running can be enjoyable again ( go to a doctor GO TO A DOCTOR the answer is always go to a doctor ) . We ’ re used to this sport being mildly uncomfortable . If pain is stopping you from getting out the door , it ’ s the pain that ’ s the problem , not the running you ’ re not doing .
 Because life can be a drag . Family stress , work stress , too much travel , not enough sleep — all of these thing can suck the luster out of your running . After I bonked on a long run a few week ago , I did this kind of self-check . It didn ’ t seem to be any of those . But I realized that even though my weekly mileage had increased , I hadn ’ t increased how much I wa eating . ( For more on the relationship between exercise and metabolism , here ’ s a report from Gretchen Reynolds on new research and my guide , How to Feed a Runner . )
 If you run the same route over and over again , run a different route — or run that route in the opposite direction . Run in the morning ? Try running at night ( properly lit up , please ) . I give prop to anyone able to run on a treadmill for more than 20 minute because treadmill make me want to drill hole into my eyeball . If you ’ re bored there , hit button : Increase the incline , or add in a few dos of running at higher speed . Or watch something different . When I ran on a treadmill more often , I ’ d often park myself in front of whatever TV wa showing the Phillies game , or “ The Price is Right , ” depending on what time of day I wa there . It helped .
 Having a destination in mind make it not just about a run , but checking something off your to-do list . I ’ ve run to my P.O . box , dropped off/picked up book at a Little Free Library , left something for my mom on her porch . I even once picked up a piece of jewelry I ’ d had engraved . I think the woman in the full fur coat wa surprised to see me in my running clothes next to her at the jewelry counter , but I got my mile in that day .
 My friend Hollie Sick , who run the site FueledbyLOLZ , said she had also been feeling unmotivated , so we decided to run together once a week . Even though she ’ s much ( much ) faster than me in race , our easy training pace is about the same . We talk about just about everything , and before we know it , our hour run is done . I even introduced her to the joy of running to a Little Free Library . Running with someone else can take your mind off a task that , right now for both of u , seems pretty blah . If you don ’ t have a running friend who ha your pace and schedule , check out your local running store to see if they have a group run . I usually join group run when I travel to a place I don ’ t know well . I did this at RunnersWorld Tulsa on a night when their group run wa also a scavenger hunt . I had a blast and got a memorable tour of a great city .
 I have said in this space many time before that you don ’ t need a ton of gear to run . However , I also realized last week that I had been switching between the same two pair of running tights that , if you combined their age , would be a high school sophomore . So I bought two new pair . I ’ m not saying you can shop your way out of being unmotivated , but a new piece of gear fall under the same category a “ do something different. ” It doesn ’ t have to be something expensive either . It can be a new hat or headband , or nail polish that match your running shoe . This is also a good time to look for deal a running store start to clear out winter gear in anticipation of spring and summer running , or are pushing the last of last summer ’ s stock out the door . I bought two pair of running short for $ 15 each this way .
 I ’ ll be taking them to Florida a week from today , on what I hope will be a magical , sunshine-filled trip to Walt Disney World . I will of course be running while there . Planning these vacation run ha been an opportunity to revisit Disney World ’ s “ jogging ” page , which feature a photo of runner that is so old that clothing like theirs is now sold a retro gear at Urban Outfitters .

 LOS ANGELES — What will happen to Sony Pictures ?
 That ha been a question in Hollywood since Kenichiro Yoshida took over a Sony Corporation ’ s chief executive in April . Unlike his two predecessor , Mr. Yoshida , a number-cruncher based in Japan and known for jettisoning underperforming business , seemed to have little affinity for the company ’ s also-ran movie and television division , which is best known a the home of Spider-Man and “ Seinfeld . ”
 Surely this would be the moment for Sony to get rid of the midsize studio — especially since Rupert Murdoch had just decided to sell his bigger 20th Century Fox to Disney , having concluded it did not have the scale needed to compete with moviedom insurgent like Netflix , Apple and Amazon .
 Surprise . When Mr. Yoshida take the stage on Monday at the CES trade show in Las Vegas , he plan to use the high-profile platform to showcase Sony movie , television show and music . He plan to telegraph that not only will his Sony not exit any of these business , it will make them a priority a his predecessor have not . In particular , Mr. Yoshida want to make better use of the company ’ s online PlayStation Network a a way to bring Sony movie , show and music directly to consumer . PlayStation Network , introduced in 2006 , now ha more than 80 million monthly active user .
 “ I want to convey the message that Sony is a creative entertainment company , ” Mr. Yoshida said by phone from Tokyo before leaving for Nevada . That description amount to a significant shift . Sony ha long been seen a a consumer electronics superpower first and a Hollywood entity second .
 He added that Sony ’ s three separately run entertainment business — music , gaming and motion picture — have been told from on high that it is time to collaborate more consistently . In the past , analyst say , PlayStation Network manager have been hesitant to team up with their movie and music counterpart , worrying that the service ’ s core gamers would balk if they felt that Sony wa pushing , say , family film at them .
 Mr. Yoshida seemed le concerned . He called PlayStation Network “ a very strong entertainment platform for all of Sony — very suitable for video and music content . ”
 Mr. Yoshida said he wa asking for collaboration at a time when all the pertinent division have new leader . Tony Vinciquerra became chief executive of Sony Pictures in June 2017 . John Kodera took over gaming slightly more than a year ago . In recent month , Rob Stringer and Jon Platt were named a Sony ’ s top executive in music recording and publishing . All report to Mr. Yoshida ; he said he had no plan to consolidate the entertainment business under a single executive .
 “ Entertainment is in Sony ’ s DNA , ” Mr. Yoshida said . “ We ’ ve now been in the music business for 50 year , the motion picture business for 30 year and the game business for over 25 years. ” For it last fiscal year , the three unit made up 47 percent of Sony ’ s operating profit , which totaled $ 6.7 billion , the highest in the conglomerate ’ s 72-year history .
 Positioning Sony a an entertainment company represents a “ directional change ” and fit with other public comment Mr. Yoshida ha made since he took over nine month ago , said Masaru Sugiyama , a Goldman Sachs analyst . “ It ha felt a if entertainment is more integrated with the rest of Sony within Yoshida-san ’ s mind , ” Mr. Sugiyama said .
 Even so , Sony is in no way leaning away from it portfolio of technology and consumer product .
 At CES , a the Las Vegas trade show is known , Sony is expected to showcase image sensor for car , new audio product , ultra-ultra high-definition television and robotics . Thomas E. Rothman , Sony ’ s movie chief , will take the stage after Mr. Yoshida to talk up the company ’ s turnaround in film , bringing along Phil Lord and Christopher Miller , producer of the studio ’ s recent “ Spider-Man : Into the Spider-Verse. ” But Mr. Rothman ’ s remark will be peppered with reference to how Sony camera have helped the studio — it tech breakthrough bolstering it creative endeavor .
 Sony ’ s entertainment empire ha it share of challenge , of course .
 After buying out partner , Sony ha outright control of the world ’ s largest catalog of music publishing asset . But the recording unit had a soft 2018 in the hit department .
 Apple ha been poaching Sony television and film executive to work on it coming streaming service . And major Sony-made television show like “ Better Call Saul ” and “ The Blacklist ” are aging . Efforts to find replacement have mostly fizzled , in part because the highest-paying TV network are ordering more show from in-house supplier .
 As a whole , however , Sony ’ s entertainment business are stronger than they have been in memory — in particular the film division , which suffered a devastating cyberattack in 2014 . Mr. Rothman and Mr. Vinciquerra have turned movie into an unexpected engine by cutting cost and focusing more intently on all-audience “ tent pole ” fantasy like “ Jumanji : Welcome to the Jungle , ” which took in $ 962 million worldwide in 2017 . To dropped jaw in Hollywood , “ Venom ” generated $ 856 million in ticket sale late last year .
 Sony ha a parade of big-budget sequel on the way — “ Men in Black : International ” arrives in June — and the studio is aggressively mining the right it hold to Marvel character in the Spider-Man comic family . To that end , movie based on Morbius , Black Cat and Silver Sable are in the work ; the Sinister Six could be Sony ’ s answer to “ The Avengers. ” Sony is also considering making animated television show based on character introduced in “ Spider-Man : Into the Spider-Verse , ” which ha collected $ 276 million at the box office .
 Now that Fox ha been sold , only Disney and Sony have right to make Marvel-related film and television content .
 And Marvel character are popular with the PlayStation Network crowd . One reason that Mr. Yoshida is pushing for more collaboration : Marvel ’ s Spider-Man , a $ 60 game , set a record for Sony in September by selling 3.3 million copy in it first three day of release .

 Swarms of any other insect might provoke fear of a coming apocalypse , but cloud of butterfly migrating through Southern California are captivating onlooker who are relishing the otherworldly spectacle .
 The orange butterfly , called painted lady , are known to travel annually from the desert of Southern California to the Pacific Northwest . This month , people are taking notice because of the sheer size of the migration : Scientists estimate the teeming painted lady number in the million .
 Substantial rainfall in the desert near the Mexican border , where the North American painted lady lay their egg , is the reason for the unusually large swarm . The rain caused plant to thrive , giving the painted lady caterpillar plenty of food to fuel their transformation , said Arthur M. Shapiro , a professor of evolution and ecology at the University of California , Davis .

 To human observer , the painted lady move with speed and intention , a if they have somewhere to be . They can fly a fast a 25 mile per hour .
 “ The striking thing is they ’ re moving very rapidly and directionally , ” said Professor Shapiro , who ha studied butterfly migration in California for more than 40 year . “ So it ’ s almost like being in a hail of bullet . ”
 They tend not to veer from oncoming car , which can prove troublesome in Los Angeles traffic . When the painted lady smash into a windshield , the result is a glob of yellow , butter-like ooze . That ’ s the result of the butterfly ’ s stored fat , used to make the long journey north , Professor Shapiro said .
 Monika Moore , a butterfly enthusiast who life in Fullerton , Calif. , said she noticed that the mass move in a strange way . The butterfly will fly low to the ground in an open field or yard , but when they encounter a tall building , they will fly over it — creating a “ funky ” up-and-down dipping pattern , said Ms. Moore , who ha a Facebook page called California Butterfly Lady .
 “ They ’ re in a hurry , like the rabbit in ‘ Alice in Wonderland , ’ ” she said . “ They have a very important date . ”
 This year , the painted lady migration in California appears to have veered off it customary course . Professor Shapiro said that if the painted lady were following their annual pattern , they should have arrived in Northern California about a week ago , yet they appear to be staying in Southern California .
 One possible explanation , Professor Shapiro said , is that there ha been such abundant rain and plant growth in Southern California that the butterfly have settled down and reproduced there .
 Professor Shapiro reported on Sunday evening that he had seen nine painted lady near where he life in the Northern California .
 “ Presumably these are the vanguard , ” he wrote in an email . “ We ’ re off and running . ”
 The explosion of plant growth in Southern California that ha fueled this migration of butterfly is in itself a spectacle . The growth of colorful wildflower , called a super bloom , ha attracted a steady stream of tourist . In 2017 , wildflower bloom in Southern California were so dense that they were visible from space .
 [ One of our reporter visited Anza-Borrego Desert State Park , a site of the super bloom . ]
 Although this year ’ s butterfly migration is significant , it pale in comparison with the swarm of 2005 . That year , scientist estimated more than a billion butterfly traveled across California . Cars on California highway looked a if they had been splattered with raw egg .
 As the painted lady linger in the southern part of the state , Californians are getting a prolonged look at the cloud of flapping orange wing .
 On an overcast day last week , Jessica McGhee biked to the waterfront in Redondo Beach to collect plastic to use to make art . Ms. McGhee said she saw a couple of butterfly flit by , then a few more . Soon they flew by in the dozen , and then in the hundred .
 “ I just sat and watched them for like two hour , ” she said . “ I felt like I wa in a Disney movie . ”

 The streaming company said it would spend up to $ 100 million on six soundstages in Brooklyn , adding to New York City ’ s growing role in the film industry .
 By Patrick McGeehan
 Netflix , the video-streaming company , said on Thursday that it would spend up to $ 100 million to expand it presence in New York City by creating a production hub in Brooklyn that would include six soundstages .
 The company already ha been producing some of it most popular show , including “ Orange Is the New Black ” and “ Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt , ” in Queens and Brooklyn .
 The proposed expansion would build on New York ’ s growing role in the booming business of film and television production . Soundstages have opened up in previously industrial section of Brooklyn and Queens , and even on Staten Island , fueled in part by the state ’ s program of production credit , which offer saving on production cost incurred in New York .
 “ New York ha created a film-friendly environment that ’ s home to some of the best creative and executive talent in the world , and we ’ re excited to provide a place for them at Netflix with our production hub , ” said Jason Hariton , the company ’ s director of worldwide studio operation and real estate .
 Gov . Andrew M. Cuomo , in a statement , said Netflix , which ha 32 employee in Manhattan , planned to add “ 127 high-paying executive content , marketing and production development job ” to that count over the next five year in an expanded executive production office in the Flatiron district of Manhattan . If Netflix creates those job and retains them through 2029 , it could receive $ 4 million in Excelsior Jobs Program tax credit through the Empire State Development agency .
 The tax incentive offered to Netflix are under the same program that wa used to lure Amazon to build a campus in Long Island City , Queens . Amazon , which would have saved roughly $ 3 billion compared to the $ 4 million in credit Netflix is eligible to receive , pulled out of the plan earlier this year .
 Netflix ’ s proposed soundstages , which it would lease after they are built in a former warehouse in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn , could hold “ thousand of production crew job , ” Mr. Cuomo said . The site is a 165,500-square-foot warehouse that wa once a printing plant , which will be converted into soundstages and operated by Gold Coast Studios .
 Netflix , which got it start by delivering movie on DVDs by mail , ha become a major player in video production . Based in Los Gatos , Calif. , it is known for spending billion to fund new production and to license original content . But it is still a newcomer to studio operation .
 Unlike HBO , Netflix ha had to rely on other production company to create it original . That changed in October 2018 when the company acquired it first studio , a New Mexico facility that wa used to make big-budget film like the blockbuster “ The Avengers . ”
 Last year , the streaming giant spent more than $ 8 billion on content , and it plan to spend more than $ 10 billion this year . A few year ago , Netflix made no original movie . As of 2019 , it will make at least 55 original film annually — about twice a many a the most prolific of the traditional studio — including some with budget a high a $ 200 million .
 Exclusive film and TV series have become critical to fending off new competitor . AT & T , the Walt Disney Company , Apple , Amazon and even Facebook are spending more on digital video , the new battleground for audience and advertising .
 Netflix ha historically relied on outside supplier . For example , Lionsgate produce “ Orange Is the New Black. ” But now Netflix ha shifted to making more of it own content , which requires stage . With all the streaming production , a shortage of soundstages exists in Los Angeles , and an under-tapped pool of creative people in New York are happy to fill the gap .
 Economics are behind the shift — a lot of big studio are embedded within conglomerate that are ending relationship with Netflix a they funnel show to their own streaming service . Netflix is also working to source more content from overseas studio .
 “ We ’ re proud Netflix chose New York to grow it business and we look forward to the job , economic activity and world-class production this project will bring , ” Mr. Cuomo said .

 ( Want to get this briefing by email ? Here ’ s the sign-up . )
 Good morning ,
 We ’ re covering the aftermath of the arrest of the WikiLeaks founder , a flurry of news from outer space , and Uber ’ s coming public offering . And it ’ s Friday , so there ’ s a new news quiz .
 The indictment against the WikiLeaks founder that wa unsealed on Thursday make no mention of his website ’ s role in Russia ’ s interference in the 2016 election , so it remains unclear whether his arrest will answer lingering question .
 Among them is what , if anything , Mr. Assange knew about Guccifer 2.0 , a hacker whom U.S. official have identified a a front for Russian operative .
 Mr. Assange , bearded and bedraggled , wa dragged from the Ecuadorean Embassy in London , where he had been sheltered since 2012 . He wa charged in the U.S. with conspiring to hack into a Pentagon computer network , a part of the process that brought WikiLeaks a trove of classified U.S. material in 2010 . The narrow indictment wa a relief to some of those who feared a case against Mr. Assange could undermine press freedom . We explained those concern .
 Closer look : From his beginning a a teenage hacker in Australia , Mr. Assange ha been a deeply divisive figure . Two of our reporter traced his history .
 What ’ s next : Mr. Assange indicated that he would fight extradition , and legal expert said that the process could take year . He is likely to argue that the case is politically motivated .
 President Omar Hassan al-Bashir lost his 30-year grip on the country on Thursday , after month of street demonstration .
 But protester ’ jubilation wa tempered by uncertainty about what might replace Mr. al-Bashir , 75 . The military said it would lead a two-year transition , with Sudan ’ s Constitution suspended .
 Background : Mr. al-Bashir had long played up his humble origin , but even for an autocrat , he had a low reputation in the West . The International Criminal Court ha accused him of playing “ an essential role ” in the genocide in the western region of Darfur in the 2000s . Military official said today that they had no intention of extraditing Mr. al-Bashir and that he would be tried in Sudan .
 Quotable : “ He ’ s like the spider at the center of the web — he could pick up on the smallest tremor , then deftly use his personalized political retail skill to manage the politics of the army , ” one Sudan expert said .
 Scott Kelly , who spent 340 day on the International Space Station , experienced genetic mutation and decline in cognitive test score . NASA reported the finding on Thursday , offering a hint at how space travel affect the body .
 Mr. Kelly ’ s twin brother , Mark , himself a former astronaut , underwent identical test on Earth to provide a comparison . Here are four takeaway from the study .
 Yesterday : An Israeli moon lander appeared to have crashed . It would have been the first private spacecraft to reach the lunar surface . Separately , SpaceX successfully launched it Falcon Heavy rocket , now the most powerful in the world , for the second time .
 Another angle : Capturing the first image of a black hole required the work of more than 200 researcher . About 40 were woman , and one , Katie Bouman , became a face for the project .
 Before what ’ s expected to be the largest initial public offering in year , the ride-hailing service said on Thursday that it had lost $ 1.8 billion last year , renewing question about the sustainability of it business . The company ’ s prospectus also showed a slowdown in revenue growth .
 The detail : Uber ’ s main rival in North America , Lyft , went public last month and appears to be growing faster . Here ’ s how the company stack up .
 Another angle : The I.P.O. , expected next month , could value Uber around $ 100 billion . Many stand to get rich , although not most of the driver integral to Uber ’ s success .
 “ Fortress North America ” is a concept that ha long comforted military planner in the U.S. and Canada . In the worst case , distance , ocean and ice would offer protection .
 The ice is now melting . But the cold remains a formidable challenge , a two Times journalist found when they embedded with military force readying to counter Russia .
 Plan for “ sanctuary city ” : The White House considered releasing apprehended migrant into so-called sanctuary city represented by Democratic lawmaker , according to people familiar with the proposal . The idea wa rejected by the immigration authority .
 New charge for Michael Avenatti : Already facing claim of fraud and extortion , the lawyer known for representing the porn star Stormy Daniels wa accused by federal prosecutor on Thursday of stealing million from client and lying about his income .
 Ex-Obama aide is indicted : Gregory Craig ha been charged with lying to the Justice Department and hiding information about his work for the government of Ukraine .
 Arrest in church fire : The 21-year-old son of a sheriff ’ s deputy ha been charged after three predominantly black church in Louisiana were set ablaze .
 Disney ’ s streaming service : The company ha offered long-awaited detail about it plan to fight the tech giant that have moved into the entertainment business . Disney Plus , a subscription video service , will cost $ 7 a month and arrive on Nov. 12 .
 Perspective : The Department of Energy want to roll back efficiency standard for light bulb . The bulb ’ s inventor , Thomas Edison , wouldn ’ t approve , two of his great-grandchildren write in an Op-Ed .
 Snapshot : Above , the funeral procession for the rapper Nipsey Hussle in Los Angeles on Thursday . Thousands of mourner , including Stevie Wonder and Snoop Dogg , gathered for a bittersweet memorial to the local hero , who wa fatally shot last month .
 News quiz : Did you follow the headline this week ? Test yourself .
 Modern Love : In this week ’ s column , a woman reach 50 and decides to donate a kidney , secretly .
 Late-night comedy : Seth Meyers had some advice for Michael Avenatti : “ When you rip people off you got ta play it cool with the money . You ’ re like the guy who buy a Ferrari and asks for the vanity plate ‘ BNK RBBR . ’ ”
 What we ’ re reading : This essay in The Atlantic . “ The writer , Caitlin Flanagan , wa once an unhappy college counselor at a private school in Los Angeles , ” say Lynda Richardson , an editor for Travel . “ She ’ s uniquely equipped to dissect the parental behavior in the college cheating scandal . Entitlement doesn ’ t even begin to cover what she find in the court document . ”
 Cook : This rainbow sprinkle cake doesn ’ t need a special occasion .
 Watch : Alex Ross Perry ’ s new feature , “ Her Smell , ” focus on an all-female band ’ s lead singer ( a raw , charismatic Elisabeth Moss ) a she run off the rail .
 Listen : The composer George Crumb turn 90 this year . The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center is presenting two concert in tribute , but , if you can ’ t make those , we have a Spotify playlist of his composition .
 Read : In “ Horizon , ” the environmentalist Barry Lopez reconstructs decade ’ worth of his observation of the natural world . It ’ s one of eight new book we recommend .
 Smarter Living : Your lawn ha an environmental impact . To reduce it , try low-maintenance ground cover , like clover , creeping thyme or native plant — but take care to avoid invasive one . Whatever you plant , avoid pesticide and aerate the soil instead .
 And we have guidance on how to go paperless on tax record , securely .
 Want to go to a party tonight ? You could say yes , but you could also say “ Poyekhali ! ” ( poe-YEK-hoe-lee ) . That ’ s “ Let ’ s go ! ” in Russian .
 That ’ s what the cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin radioed to controller during liftoff for the world ’ s first human spaceflight , 58 year ago today . The term will be bandied around the world this evening , in Yuri ’ s Night celebration .
 The Soviet Union commemorated the flight by establishing Cosmonautics Day , which ha been celebrated since with parade and space-themed event .
 The hipper Yuri ’ s Night began in the U.S. in 2000 , with raf and party for scientist . It caught on . The crew of the International Space Station sometimes sends greeting .
 Parties are planned on at least five continent , including at a research station in Antarctica .
 Loretta Hidalgo Whitesides , a writer , public speaker and spaceflight proponent who founded Yuri ’ s Night with her husband , urge partyers to “ have a beer with a rocket scientist . ”
 That ’ s it for this briefing .
 The weekend is coming ( a is the “ Game of Thrones ” premiere ) . Enjoy .

 The Carpetbagger
 By Kyle Buchanan
 The Oscar nomination are read in Los Angeles at just after 5 in the morning , a time when most late-to-wake Hollywood type would rather be slumbering underneath high-thread-count sheet . Still , the Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige wasn ’ t about to miss the televised announcement .
 “ I watched them this morning for the first time in many year , ” Feige told your Carpetbagger today by phone . “ I set my alarm , and I haven ’ t done that since I wa a film nerd in college . ”
 His interest wa well-rewarded : “ Black Panther ” became the first Marvel film to score a nomination for best picture , and the phenomenally successful superhero film picked up six more nomination to boot . “ I ’ m feeing a sense of pride and humility and immense gratitude , ” Feige said .
 [ Read more about the nomination | Check out the full list of nominee | See the snub and surprise . ]
 And though the academy failed to nominate Ryan Coogler for directing and co-writing the film , “ you ’ re going to hear me say the name ‘ Ryan Coogler ’ constantly on this phone call , ” Feige said , emphasizing the importance of inclusive and diverse filmmaking . “ To me , the best thing a producer can do is find a person with something to say , who ha a story to tell and can tell it in a way that the world responds to . That ’ s what Mr. Coogler ha done for u . ”
 Feige is known for being one of Hollywood ’ s most even-keeled executive , so I asked if he found himself exclaiming aloud a any of the nomination were read . “ It mainly manifested itself in numerous emojis , ” Feige said . On a group chat that included Coogler , the executive producer Nate Moore and Disney chief executive Bob Iger , there were “ a lot of firework- and confetti-laden text message flying fast and furious . ”
 To composer Ludwig Goransson , whose “ Black Panther ” score wa nominated , Feige texted a video Coogler had taped two year ago when the two men decided on the theme music , “ where Ryan recorded himself dancing around with this unbelievable joy. ” Feige wa just a eager to text the production designer Hannah Beachler , who became the first African-American to be nominated in her category .
 “ She wa hired in the room , ” Feige said . “ I knew she ’ d never worked on a film this large before and had concern about that , but we wanted to give her a chance to come in and pitch her vision for the movie . She came in and blew u away instantly . Journeys don ’ t get better than that . ”
 But even with all the congratulation — and an additional visual-effects nomination for the studio ’ s “ Avengers : Infinity War ” — Feige had to get back to work . Marvel ha plenty on it plate this spring , including the release of “ Captain Marvel ” and “ Avengers : Endgame , ” and a day off to celebrate just wouldn ’ t do .
 Still , he said , “ there ’ s enthusiasm in the hallway , that ’ s for sure . ”

 AUGUSTA , Ga. — Jason Day began the Masters by throwing his back out while leaning down to kiss his daughter on the practice green .
 He played his way onto the leaderboard a day later after receiving a scolding from his wife .
 `` It 's the Masters , you need to suck it up , '' Day said his wife , Ellie , told him Friday morning .
 Day , who ha a history of being bothered by medical issue , did better than just sucking it up . He went out and shot a 5-under 67 to move into a tie for the second-round lead .
 And that had him feeling a lot better .
 `` I ca n't complain about it too much , '' Day said . `` She 's birthed three child and I have n't , so she 's a lot stronger a a person than me with regard to pain , and I just hit a little white golf ball around a course . ''
 Day birdied all the par-5s on Augusta National to get to 7-under-par going into the weekend . That followed a 2-under 70 the day before , when Day said he injured himself kissing his daughter just a few minute before walking to the first tee .
 Day 's trainer followed him around the course in the opening round , giving him treatment at one point a he lay down on the second tee box . Day said he briefly considered pulling out of the tournament but decided to play in hope his back would loosen up .
 Exercise and treatment helped enough that he wa relatively pain free in the second round , and Day took advantage . He wa particularly effective on the reachable par-5s , making birdie on all four after birdieing three the day before .
 `` The whole goal is to try and take advantage of the par 5 here this week , '' Day said . `` The par 3 can be difficult at time , and then some of the par 4 , you need to get through . But you know , over the last two day , I 've played the par 5 nicely . ''
 Just being able to play this year ha been difficult at time for Day , who withdrew from the Bay Hill tournament earlier this year because of back issue .
 He doe stretch and therapy for 20-30 minute at night and the same in the morning . He blow into a balloon to , he said , move his rib cage into proper position .
 And he deal with the negative fallout on social medium when he leaf a golf tournament because of medical issue . At the age of 31 that 's happened nine time already , and that doe n't include when he collapsed on the ninth green in the opening round of the U.S. Open in 2015 because of vertigo .
 After his withdrawal at Bay Hill someone posted a photo on social medium of Day walking around with his family at Disney World the next day .
 `` Pain is a funny thing , it go up and down , and everybody 's pain threshold is different , '' he said . `` Someone that is in a lot of pain might feel , you know , something totally different compared to me , so it 's hard . Every day I feel like I wake up with some sort of ache , you know , and I think you just kind of learn to live with it and you just go along the way . ''
 Day , an Australian native who life in the U.S. , ha won 12 time on the PGA Tour , including his lone major , the PGA Championship in 2015 . He won twice last year and ha played relatively well this year , with three top-10 finish , and is ranked 14th in the world .
 The Masters is his favorite tournament and one he might have expected to win by now . He finished tied for second in his first Masters in 2011 .
 If anything , Day say , he might want the green jacket too much . And , in a funny kind of way , his bad back might ease the pressure this week .
 `` Yeah , definitely . Especially at a place like this , '' he said . `` ... How big and the distraction of wanting to win this tournament so bad , and sometimes it 's almost a blessing in disguise with regard to it just brings down the expectation of going out there and trying too hard . ''

 Marc Jacobs and Char Defrancesco celebrated their union with dancing , drag queen and 700 guest at the old Four Seasons .
 By Matthew Schneier and Valeriya Safronova
 It wa a fairy-tale wedding with an unconventional cast : Marc Jacobs , the New York designer , and his betrothed , Charly “ Char ” Defrancesco , a modern-day chandler with the build of a modern-day goliath , danced the night away in the shadow of a cake taller than either . Seven hundred friend and family attended , including a few crasher ( not u ! ) and enough famous fairy godmother to stock a Disney studio for the next hundred year : Naomi Campbell , Kate Moss , Bette Midler , Anna Wintour and Lil ’ Kim .
 On Saturday night , behind the swaying metal curtain of the Grill and the Pool ( née the Four Seasons ) , Philip Johnson ’ s modernist masterpiece on East 52nd Street , the guest descended . They had come from all over ( people in the industry joked about “ fashion bus ” arriving for the weekend ) , super-fit per usual , but bloated with anticipation .
 Bryanboy , a.k.a . Bryan Grey Yambao , the blogger-turned-fashion influencer whose early adoration of the Marc Jacobs label led Mr. Jacobs to name a bag in his honor , flew from Sweden to attend .
 “ There wa this expectation that it wa going to be the wedding of the century , ” he said . “ And it wa . ”
 A slight hyperbole , perhaps , but fashion is not known for it moderate statement . Neither is Mr. Jacobs . Since his enfant terrible debut in 1984 , Mr. Jacobs ha been a proponent of more , more , more : more frill and fabulosity ( a guest wearing the enormous concoction from his recent runway show could attest ) , more radical honesty ( a anyone who can remember the tabloid high jinks around his slip and sexcapade ) and more good-natured shrugging about both .
 Mr. Jacobs , who turn 56 on April 9 , may be showing sign of settling down in the good old-fashioned newlywed tradition — he and Mr. Defrancesco , 36 , will be decamping , at least part time , to the suburb , more specifically to a 1955 Frank Lloyd Wright house in Rye , N.Y. , where the actual wedding ceremony wa held for a much smaller group of 40 intimate on Friday — but pomp and circumstance still have a place in his heart .
 How else to explain the sister Hadid and the drag queen Miss Fame and Manila Luzon , Rita Ora and Kaia Gerber , Justin Vivian Bond and night-life queen Susanne Bartsch , all a-shimmy ? Even Phoebe Philo , the rarely glimpsed , much-lauded former designer of Céline , wa there , all smile . ( This isn ’ t even to mention Mr. Jacobs ’ s proposal a year ago , delivered with a flash mob in a Chipotle . ) No seated dinner , no rubber chicken : just passed slider and caviar , plus pasta for carbo-loading .

 WOODMERE , N.Y. — If there is a world in which theater kid rule , Andrew Barth Feldman seems to live there .
 He wanders through the hall of his high school — a lank , 5-foot-6 , Disney-obsessed 16-year-old prone to bursting into song — like the mayor . Photos of him dot the hallway . Teachers stop mid-lesson when they spot him in the hallway , hoping he ’ ll come in and say hello to their class . A basketball star in the cafeteria smile and wave . The little kid in the library gawk a they hurtle by .
 He ’ s long been a standout in their world — the kid who wa organizing flash mob at fourth-grade assembly , who founded his own theater company at 12 ( it ’ s still going ) , who ha been acting in school play and camp show and community theater production for a long a anyone can remember .
 And now he ’ s going to Broadway .
 Even in an industry that delight in discovery , this teenager ’ s right-place-right-time story is one for the book : Last June , he wa competing in the National High School Musical Theater Awards ( known a the Jimmys ) — which he won — when the lead producer of “ Dear Evan Hansen ” happened to be in the audience .
 She knew immediately she wanted him for the show , and on Jan. 30 , he assumes the title role , playing Broadway ’ s favorite socially anxious and ethically confused adolescent .
 “ I ’ m so nervous all the time about it , ” he said , cleareyed , candid , and strikingly courteous a we talked in an empty classroom . “ If I were to make my Broadway debut in any role , it ’ s Evan , ” he added , somehow managing to be confident and self-doubting at the same time . “ This is my favorite show since I saw it , and everyone ha always said I ’ m right for the role . I think I agree . ”
 The role is wrenching , vocally and emotionally , and Andrew will be the first teenager to tackle it on Broadway . The character is 17 , but adolescent boy are often thought to be too immature to play adolescent boy , and all of his predecessor have been in their 20 ; Ben Platt , who won a Tony Award originating the role , wa 23 when the show opened .
 “ There ’ s the possibility of getting u something that ’ s authentic and original and vital and ha never been seen , ” said the show ’ s director , Michael Greif .
 Andrew is so young — and so new to the rigor of Broadway — that he ’ s going to begin his run doing just five performance a week , while taking vocal lesson to shore up his stamen . This will be his first professional production , and the creative team , determined to protect him a well a their smash-hit show , ha decided the reduced schedule is their way of investing in his long-term success ; the show ’ s alternate , Michael Lee Brown , will do the other three performance a Andrew build comfort and strength .
 “ It ’ s a little scary for all of u — for him , for me , for his mom — because we ’ re asking a lot of him , ” said Stacey Mindich , the show ’ s lead producer . “ But in every single moment he ha grown with u already — at every passage he ha shown u he is uber-capable . ”
 This is not one of those story about someone who happened into theater unwittingly . This is a story about an unabashed theater geek — a child who ha adored Broadway since he saw “ Beauty and the Beast ” at age 3 , who ha been happily singing on stage since he landed the role of Mr. Bundles in a community theater production of “ Annie ” at age 8 ; who writes song and play the piano , guitar , drum , ukulele and bass ; who ha been to all four edition of BroadwayCon , including the one last year where he won a lip-syncing competition while performing a Angelica Schuyler from “ Hamilton . ”
 His passion for the imaginary go way beyond musical . He ’ s a huge fan of “ Star Wars ” — “ We watched ‘ A New Hope ’ in English class to learn about archetype , and I wa like , ‘ Oh my God , this is the coolest thing ’ ” — and ha dressed a General Grievous and Kylo Ren for Halloween . ( It ’ s not that he ’ s drawn to the dark side ; it ’ s just , he say , that those character look cooler . )
 He ’ s an even huger fan of Disney ( which now owns “ Star Wars , ” so maybe that ’ s redundant ) . He estimate that he ’ s been to Disney theme park , including Disneyworld , Disneyland and Disneyland Paris , at least 20 time , starting when he wa 6 month old . “ Something draw me to the idea of being able to live in another world , ” he said .
 And now he really , really love “ Dear Evan Hansen. ” The first time he saw the musical , a couple of week after it opened on Broadway in 2016 , he wa so overcome he couldn ’ t find the word to talk about it when his mother came to pick him up .
 “ It really , really hit hard , ” he said . “ I had never had such a visceral reaction to anything . Ever . ”
 He started playing the cast album on repeat . He sent song to friend . He saw it again . And again .
 He relates to Evan , and not just because he , like the character , life with his single mom . “ I mean , I ’ m a teenager , ” he said . “ I ’ ve been lucky to never personally struggle with a diagnosis of anxiety or anything , but I am a teenager . Of course I feel anxiety . Of course I feel nervous . Of course I feel alone . ”
 He called Evan “ a manifestation of what ’ s going on in our head a teenager — he just can ’ t control what ’ s going on the outside a much a most of u can. ” And he asserted , with the confidence of a teenager who ha been seeing a many Broadway show a he could for a long a he can remember , “ there ha never been a character so thoroughly real and authentic to that experience . ”
 I asked Andrew to show me around his high school — Lawrence Woodmere Academy , a small private school in the Five Towns section of Long Island — since he ’ ll be portraying a high school senior on Broadway while still a high school junior himself .
 Of course , a of a few week ago , he ’ s not actually showing up for class — Broadway is too time-consuming , so instead he ’ s being tutored for 15 hour a week .
 He grew up nearby , first in Hewlett Neck , and then in Woodmere . His mother is an alumna and administrator at the school ; his father , a lawyer , life in Manhattan , and he ha an older sister . His tight-knit family also includes his mother ’ s sister , who life down the street ; the sister raised their child together , and Andrew regard his cousin a his brother .
 Andrew ha been performing nonstop since “ Annie. ” He had tried a variety of sport , but didn ’ t like them ; he wa better at teaching his fellow 9- and 10-year-olds to sing Beatles tune . And then his parent ’ marriage wa splitting up , and his ailing grandparent had moved into his house , so his mother , Barbra Feldman , wa thrilled that he had found something he could do in a place that felt healthier than home at the time . She ha spent the year since supporting his enthusiasm . “ My plan wa not for my son to be a Broadway star , ” she said . “ My plan wa to have a happy , well-adjusted child . ”
 He ha played an amazing array of role — the donkey in “ Shrek , ” Danny in “ Grease , ” Jack in “ Into the Woods ” — because over the last few year , he ha often been doing five show at a time , performing not only at school but also at Plaza Theatrical Productions in Lynbrook , the Rockaway Theater Company and St. Gregory ’ s Theater Group in Queens and Broadway Workshop in Manhattan . He ha also built a large group of friend from the theater world ; he met his girlfriend , who life in Maryland , at Broadway Workshop .
 “ He ’ s the nicest child I ’ ve ever worked with , ” said Marc Tumminelli , the director of Broadway Workshop . “ And by being in amazing show , a well a show that weren ’ t that great , he built his own process , so he ’ s ready . ”
 The composer of “ Be More Chill , ” Joe Iconis , said he met Andrew in 2017 , when the teenager wa performing a Roger in a youth theater production of “ Rent ” that Mr. Iconis ’ s brother wa directing . “ It wa truly insane watching that kid sing ‘ One Song Glory ’ a well a I ’ ve ever heard it sung ever , ” he said . “ He ’ s some sort of insane musical theater creature who ha a preternatural ability to perform . ”
 The theater company Andrew founded — called Zneefrock after the name Andrew made up for the alien at the now-closed space-themed restaurant Mars 2112 — began a his bar mitzvah project . He wanted to hold a one-night cabaret to raise money for autism research , because one of his cousin is on the autism spectrum .
 That evening of “ Les Misérables ” and “ Wicked ” medley held at the school theater wa so successful , drawing theater kid , their family and fan that it became an annual event , with each one more ambitious , and raising more money for charity , than the one before . There wa the “ Star Wars ” parody musical , which Andrew wrote with a friend ; a minimalist reimagining of “ Seussical ” ; and , last summer , a production of “ Be More Chill ” ( yes , they managed to stage the show before it arrives on Broadway this winter ) .
 And then , most impressively , last fall Zneefrock staged Jason Robert Brown ’ s “ The Last Five Years , ” which is a beloved two-hander about the rise and fall of an unsuccessful marriage , with a different gender configuration at each performance — boy-girl , girl-boy , boy-boy and girl-girl — to see how the show ’ s complex romantic dynamic might shift .
 Now Andrew ’ s life is all Evan .
 He said his house suddenly look a if it wa decorated by Ms. Mindich because there is so much stuff bearing the show ’ s signature color . “ It ’ s like , everything is blue now , ” he said .
 He ha vowed to stop eating dairy ( hard when chocolate milk is still a dietary staple ) , and started drinking a lot of tea ( plus water , water , and water ) . He ’ s rehearsing up to five hour a day , six day a week . And he ’ s thinking about Evan .
 “ Who is this person , separated from the performance that I ’ ve seen ? ” he asks himself a he delf deeper and deeper into the role . “ I learn a bunch of new thing about him every day , every rehearsal , every time I sit down and look at the script . And I ’ m going to find him . ”
 An earlier version of this article misstated Evan Hansen ’ s year in high school . The character is a senior , not a junior .

 Who are your favorite superheroes ? Are any of them female ?
 Does the gender of a comic character matter ? Why or why not ?
 In “ Can ‘ Captain Marvel ’ Fix Marvel ’ s Woman Problem ? , ” Dave Itzkoff writes :
 When “ Captain Marvel ” open next Friday , it will be a moment of great satisfaction mixed with lingering frustration .
 The film , which star Brie Larson a that spacefaring comic-book superhero , is the 21st entry in the interconnected Marvel movie franchise since it began in 2008 but only the first to focus principally on a woman .
 By now , audience have grown accustomed to superhero movie that put woman in the spotlight . In 2017 , “ Wonder Woman , ” based on DC Comics ’ Amazonian warrior , wa a worldwide hit for Warner Bros .
 Marvel ha built it own fortune on a decades-old supply of costumed adventurer that doesn ’ t lack for woman . And the studio ha been criticized for it slowness to create movie emphasizing it female character .
 So what took Marvel a long a it did to reach this point ? And will “ Captain Marvel ” be the movie that make good on this long unfulfilled potential ?
 The article concludes :
 It ’ s unclear whether “ Captain Marvel ” will be the start of a trend or an outlier for Marvel . Hollywood trade publication have reported that the studio is preparing other female-led project , including a Black Widow movie , starring Johansson and directed by Cate Shortland ( “ Lore ” ) , and a film adaptation of the Eternals , directed by Chloé Zhao ( “ The Rider ” ) . But Disney said it could not confirm Marvel ’ s development slate .
 Whether “ Captain Marvel ” can be a harbinger for other movie like it , Larson said , “ is a larger question , a systemic thing . ”
 “ That change is scary , ” she said , “ and it take time for it to come . It ’ s slow but it ’ s happening . ”
 The only way such progress can happen , Larson said , is if she and her peer use the influence afforded by movie like “ Captain Marvel ” to strive for further change and to make them permanent .
 “ Part of why I ’ m pushing really hard now is because I do have a little bit of power , and I ’ m going to use it , ” she said . “ You don ’ t know when it ’ s going to shift again or who ’ s going to have the power next . But I ’ ll push it a far a I can . Because it ’ s the right thing to do . ”
 Students , read the entire article , then tell u :
 — Do we need more female superheroes ? Does the gender of a superhero matter ?
 — Heidi MacDonald , editor of The Beat , a comic culture website , said of Stan Lee , the longtime editor of Marvel Comics :
 “ You can ’ t help but think that if Stan Lee wasn ’ t a conscious sexist , he certainly wa so traditional . He gave his female character the weakest power — ‘ Oh , I can get very small. ’ ‘ I can turn invisible. ’ ‘ I can move a teacup with my mind . ’ ”
 Does Marvel Comics have a “ woman problem ? ” How well do you think woman and female superheroes have been depicted in Marvel film ? Do you think the success of Captain Marvel might lead to a trend of female superheroes in featured role ?
 — Who is your favorite among female superheroes ? What characteristic make them most compelling to you ? Tell u why .
 — Which female superhero would you like to see featured in a movie ? Write the opening to a pitch to Hollywood executive to greenlight this film .
 — Will you see Captain Marvel when it open on Friday ?

 For the Paris fashion world , Notre-Dame and all it represents wa a gravitational pole .
 By Vanessa Friedman
 There ha never been a fashion show inside the Cathedral of Notre-Dame , or in the piazza splayed in front of it , the way there have been in French cultural landmark like the Louvre , the Palais de Justice and the National Archives .
 But there might a well have been . It is embedded on the psychographic style map of the city , it two tower a defining a silhouette a the New Look , it image practically a brand in itself .
 Four time a year , a the couture and ready-to-wear show dawn in Paris , town car and editor and retailer shod in stilettoes or Stan Smiths would crisscross the quais from the Tennis Club de Paris to Bercy , Austerlitz to the Pompidou .
 Each time , they would swirl past the tower and rose window of the cathedral on the Île de la Cité , the nexus of a diagonal from the Sixth Arrondissement headquarters of Sonia Rykiel to the Fourth Arrondissement home of Azzedine Alaïa , all around it other showroom and atelier like pearl on a string .
 When it burned , so did one of the pole by which the fashion world orient itself , and not just geographically .
 The tragedy at Notre-Dame pierced viewer around the world , and leader of all kind have responded with emotion and support . For the French , there ’ s a more visceral connection between French fashion and French monument that ha to do with definition of the country ’ s culture and how it is disseminated around the world .
 To designer of French brand , whose identity is wrapped up in the history of Paris , Notre-Dame is not just an example of gorgeous architecture ( though it is that , and designer often cite various building a catalyst for their imagination ) , nor is it just another tourist draw that help bring their customer to France ( though it is that , too ) .
 It is , in a more abstract sense , part of their own patrimony , an example and embodiment of the value they hold dear and that define their work at it best : beauty , artisanship , handwork , heritage , the emotion that can be evoked by creativity . A concrete — or rather , stone and wood — example of the worth that resides in these concept . A character in the myth of Frenchness written by Victor Hugo and Disney .
 And for anyone trying to capture that elusive quality of Frenchness and give it form — which is , let ’ s face it , part of the promise of French fashion , especially those brand that are synonymous with that je ne sais quoi ( Dior , Saint Laurent , Givenchy , Chanel and Hermès ) — Notre-Dame wa an essential reference . Just a it wa shorthand for the saga that surround it , be they of Joan of Arc , Napoleon or de Gaulle , which also provide the element of a sartorial vocabulary all designer share .
 That is why over the year it wa so often used a a backdrop in glossy magazine feature , an image that could immediately telegraph place a well a aura and association . As the photo of flame went round the world , so many designer joined the chorus of mourning .
 “ While it wa burning , a part of all of u wa smoking away with immense sadness , ” Anthony Vaccarello , the creative director of Yves Saint Laurent , said on Tuesday . Earlier he had posted a photo of the burning building on Instagram with one simple word : “ sad . ”
 He wa not the only one to demonstrate solidarity on social medium . “ Sadness for what is happening right now at Notre Dame , a place which hold a big space in my heart , ” posted Riccardo Tisci , the Burberry designer who wa creative director of Givenchy for 12 year . Diane von Furstenberg and Clare Waight Keller of Givenchy likewise took to Instagram to express their emotion .
 In a text , Nicolas Ghesquière , the artistic director of Louis Vuitton woman ’ s wear , called the cathedral a “ testament to human strength , inventiveness and faith . ”
 And Peter Copping , the former designer of Nina Ricci , who is British but based in Paris , wrote in an email that when he moved to the city , Notre-Dame “ wa the first place on my list to see . It is a huge part of the fabric of Paris — a city I love , that I have made my home and is very special to me . ”
 Little wonder that the titan of the two largest French fashion and luxury group — Bernard Arnault of LVMH and François-Henri Pinault of Kering — were among the first business leader to pledge million of euro to the restoration of the cathedral . ( Together their donation total over $ 300 million . )
 For those who aspire to be guardian and steward of French savoir-faire , what better way to prove it ? Especially at a time when luxury itself is under attack , the window of it gilded emporium broken by the so-called Yellow Vest movement , a symbol of elitism and division rather than culture .
 Now , of course , Notre-Dame ’ s famous buttress and centuries-old line have been warped by disaster . But if there is one thing that fashion know , it is that the design of the past can be given new form , and new life .

 Last month , Skydance Animation raised many eyebrow when it announced that John Lasseter — one of the most influential figure in the animation field and a co-founder of Pixar — would become it new head . After all , Lasseter had left the Walt Disney Company last year following employee complaint about unwanted touching .
 But reaction in some corner went beyond a raised eyebrow : Emma Thompson , the two-time Oscar winner who had previously worked on the Pixar film “ Brave ” with Lasseter , wanted out of a Skydance project .
 Last week , The Hollywood Reporter , citing anonymous source , reported that Thompson had backed out of a voice part in “ Luck , ” a Skydance movie with Alessandro Carloni attached to direct , because of concern about working on a project for a studio run by Lasseter .
 Thompson had actually left the project , it turn out , on Jan. 20 , 11 day after Lasseter ’ s hiring wa officially announced . Three day later she sent a scathing letter to Skydance , detailing her decision to leave , that wa published on Tuesday by the Los Angeles Times . A representative for Thompson confirmed it content .
 “ It feel very odd to me that you and your company would consider hiring someone with Mr. Lasseter ’ s pattern of misconduct given the present climate in which people with the kind of power that you have can reasonably be expected to step up to the plate , ” Thompson wrote .
 She said she realized the situation wa “ complicated ” and called Carloni , the director , “ wonderful , ” but nonetheless excoriated Skydance .
 “ If a man ha been touching woman inappropriately for decade , why would a woman want to work for him if the only reason he ’ s not touching them inappropriately now is that it say in his contract that he must behave ‘ professionally ’ ? ” Thompson said in the letter .
 It continued : “ If a man ha made woman at his company feel undervalued and disrespected for decade , why should the woman at his new company think that any respect he show them is anything other than an act that he ’ s required to perform by his coach , his therapist and his employment agreement ? The message seems to be , ‘ I am learning to feel respect for woman so please be patient while I work on it . It ’ s not easy . ’ ”
 A representative for Skydance declined to comment .
 The British-born Thompson is an accomplished figure in Hollywood , with a career stretching back to the early 1980s . She voiced the part of Elinor in 2012 ’ s “ Brave , ” a Pixar production that Lasseter executive produced . The movie won praise from critic partly for being the first Pixar movie to have a female protagonist .
 Skydance ’ s decision to hire Lasseter wa met with immediate criticism . Time ’ s Up , the Hollywood advocacy group formed to fight workplace sexual harassment , said in a statement that the move “ endorses and perpetuates a broken system that allows powerful men to act without consequence . ”
 David Ellison , the chief executive officer of Skydance Media , said in a statement at the time , “ We do not enter into this decision lightly . John ha acknowledged and apologized for his mistake and , during the past year away from the workplace , ha endeavored to address and reform them . ”
 In a memo to Skydance employee , which wa published by The Hollywood Reporter last month , Ellison said the company had hired “ outside counsel to thoroughly investigate the allegation , which we considered serious and have warranted our full attention a we made this important decision . ”
 Later , the memo said , “ We are certain that John ha learned valuable lesson and is ready to prove his capability a a leader and a colleague . And he ha given his assurance that he will comport himself in a wholly professional manner that is the expectation of every Skydance colleague and partner . ”

 A historically high number of top movie had black director last year , according to a sweeping study , released on Friday , that examined diversity behind the scene and in studio boardroom .
 While 2018 wa a banner year for black director — with 16 working on the top 100 film — 15 of those 16 director were men ; the one woman in that group wa Ava DuVernay ( “ A Wrinkle in Time ” ) . The overall figure wa up from six black director working on the top 100 film in 2017 and eight in 2007 .
 “ While we do not see this finding mirrored among female or Asian director , this offer proof that Hollywood can change when it want to , ” said Stacy L. Smith , who wrote the report with the University of Southern California Annenberg Inclusion Initiative , which released it .
 Indeed , the remainder of the research showed little change for other ethnicity group or for woman . Surveying the 1,200 top-grossing film from 2007-18 , researcher found that just over 4 percent had female director , which meant that they were outnumbered by their male counterpart by a ratio of 22 to 1 . And Asians represented just 3.6 percent of last year ’ s top 100 grossing director , a number that changed little over 12 year .
 The study , “ Inclusion in the Director ’ s Chair ? , ” also found that between 82 percent and 98 percent of all production designer , cinematographer , editor and composer were men ; and of the few woman holding those job , the vast majority were white .
 “ Women of color are nearly invisible in film production — whether a director , producer , or in below-the-line crew position , ” Dr. Smith said . “ A mere 1.4 percent of editor , 1.5 percent of production designer and 1.6 percent of producer were woman of color . Only one woman of color worked a a composer across the 300 film we examined , and there were no underrepresented female director of photography . ”
 There wa , however , an increase in the number of female board member at seven major entertainment company : The study found that woman — most of them white — occupied a quarter of those position , up from le than one-fifth last year .
 Examining diverse hiring by studio , the researcher found that in 2018 , only three out of seven major entertainment company had woman director on their film : Universal , Walt Disney Studios and Lionsgate , which each released one film directed by a woman . Broken down by ethnicity , Sony released the most film by black director last year — five — while Warner Bros. released none .
 However , Warner Bros. did release two film by Asian director , out of a total of four Asian-directed film released by those seven major company last year .

Two year later , when journalism circle considered the iPad to be the delivery system of the future , he founded The Daily , a tablet-only subscription publication . Even with a $ 30 million budget , it crashed and burned , but that did not stop Mr. Angelo ’ s rise .
 He became publisher and chief executive of The Post in 2012 . In 2017 , he created “ Page Six TV , ” a syndicated daily TV show along the line of “ Entertainment Tonight ” and “ Access Hollywood . ”

 Ben Pederson ’ s “ Shape Trees ’ ’ ; Tatsuo Miyajima ’ s red LED sculpture ; Sophie von Hellermann ’ s beguiling painting ; Norman Lewis ’ s Eastern influence ; and artwork ‘ ‘ under erasure . ’ ’
 Through Feb. 3 . Ortega y Gasset Projects , 363 Third Avenue , Brooklyn ; oygprojects.com .
 Entering Ben Pederson ’ s solo exhibition , “ Some Stuff You Forgot About , ” at Ortega y Gasset Projects , feel like stepping into a dream world : You see familiar form , but they don ’ t adhere to a logic you understand . There ’ s a pair of jean short ( part of a work called “ Jorts , ” from 2017 ) dangling upside down and fitted on painted cardboard stump that look like cactus . In another work , “ Sup ? ” ( 2017 ) , a short , speckled ladder hang in midair . Recurring rectangle covered with bright streak and blob of color look like miniature abstract painting or clay tablet or even photo frame .
 Many of these object are sculptural remnant from Mr. Pederson ’ s studio . They ’ re connected by hook , chain and strand of bead in a series of dazzling mobile that fill the hallway leading to the gallery ’ s main space . Hanging floor to ceiling and obstructing the path , the mobile form a kind of web that seems to evoke Mr. Pederson ’ s wacky artistic subconscious . Visitors are both invited and forced to navigate it .
 The tone in the main gallery is more sober . A book display 28 watercolor , each one a distinct shape awash in pattern and color . Mr. Pederson , who say idea often come to him from an “ Alien Platonic Realm , ” created the form while in a meditative state . They reappear in three dimension in a set of sculpture suspended from the ceiling and a line of “ Shape Trees ” ( 2018 ) displayed on pedestal , where they seem to sprout from artificial branch . Mr. Pederson ’ s work can seem purely playful — but at his best , he mine the limit of recognizability to challenge our perception . His shape and sculptural scrap are like pictograph in an artistic language that ’ s still unfolding . JILLIAN STEINHAUER
 Through Feb. 16 . Lisson Gallery , 138 10th Avenue , Manhattan ; 212-505-6431 , lissongallery.com .
 Every piece in the Japanese artist Tatsuo Miyajima ’ s “ Innumerable Life/Buddha ” is a square grid of red LED numeral counting down from nine to one . They descend at various speed , and occasionally , apparently at random , wink out entirely . ( According to the show ’ s news release , Mr. Miyajima leaf out the zero because it stand for death , but I ’ d prefer to imagine that he doe it a a sort of double wink to the empty circle of traditional Zen ink painting . ) The smallest grid is 30 inch by 30 inch , or 30 digit by 30 , and the largest , 100 by 100 , giving it a total of 10,000 searingly bright digital counter .
 That number is no coincidence . In East Asia , “ ten thousand ” is a proverbial stand-in for the myriad thing of the phenomenal world . And Mr. Miyajima ’ s wall piece , whatever their incidental similarity to electronic or minimal art , are very traditional Buddhist portrait of the world a an apparently fleeting , essentially changeless realm that can be both heaven and hell . The constant red flicker of what look like urgent information conjures a mood of existential emergency : They look like control panel at Norad on a terrible day . But the pattern of scattered light going off evokes the serenely weightless beauty of a gentle snowfall on a hidden pond . WILL HEINRICH
 Through Feb. 2 . Greene Naftali , 508 West 26th Street , Manhattan ; 212-463-7770 , greenenaftaligallery.com .
 History and place are treated like fantasy in Sophie von Hellermann ’ s group of new painting at Greene Naftali , “ Ileden , ” which take it title from a bucolic hamlet in Kent , England . Working in a new studio there , Ms. von Hellermann wa motivated by Ileden ’ s natural surroundings a well a by story that reached her ear while she wa there .
 “ Ileden Woods ” ( all work are from 2018 ) , “ Buzzard , ” “ Pheasant ” and “ Moonrise ” seem painted from life experience — albeit in bright acid color and in a flat , illustrative style . “ Viking Sword ” relates the story , which Ms. von Hellermann heard while working in Ileden , about a girl finding a 3,000 year-old pre-Viking sword in a Swedish lake . Other work were inspired by a local World War II plane crash in which the Polish pilot miraculously survived , a fire that burned down Ileden Manor , or people dancing the night away in disco somewhere in the world .
 Ms. von Hellermann ’ s quick , immediate-looking approach ha the breathlessness and dynamism of an old Disney animation film , but she draw from a panoply of historical painting style , from old master to Marc Chagall . ( Similarly , Tyrus Wong , who helped create Disney ’ s recognizable style in the 1940s , based his work partly on Song dynasty landscape painting . )
 Ms. von Hellermann , who is based in London , remains self-deprecating about her process , saying in an accompanying gallery release that she is always aware “ that being a painter is ridiculous. ” That sense of play , of unserious-seriousness , translates into joyous , ecstatic composition , and turn painting into a fantasy space , supported by story that sound like modern fairy tale .

 Through Jan. 27 . Pierogi , 155 Suffolk Street , Manhattan ; 646-429-9073 , pierogi2000.com .
 More than 80 artwork , by a many artist , use erasure and deletion a positive technique in “ Under Erasure , ” curated by Heather and Raphael Rubinstein at Pierogi Gallery . Text piece range from Tom Phillips ’ s “ A Humument , ” an elaborately painted-over found novel that the artist ha been reworking since 1966 , to Jen Bervin ’ s “ Nets ” ( 2004 ) , which gray out most of the word in Shakespeare ’ s sonnet to create spare new poem like this one , from Sonnet 14 : “ Pointing to each/ constant/ from/ this/ date. ” Visual art analogue , many of which also use text , include Samuel Jablon ’ s scribbly red painting “ Half Destroyed , ” in which the piece ’ s title is reduced to a set of free-form wavery line , and a small abstraction by Charline von Heyl that find a muddy new color in a hasty smear .
 Erasure is protest in Ariana Boussard-Reifel ’ s “ Between the Lines , ” for which the artist individually excised every word from a white supremacist book called “ RaHoWa , ” and it stand for gentrification in Loren Munk ’ s “ An Attempted Documentation of Williamsburg 1981-2008. ” But the piece that best capture this encyclopedic show ’ s central insight — that creation is inseparable from destruction , because you can ’ t get one thing without losing another — is Ms. Rubinstein ’ s canvas “ Painting a a Non-Professional Experiment. ” In it , she repurposes Mr. Rubinstein ’ s similarly titled poem about the solitude of writing by painting over the word “ poetry , ” whenever it appears , with “ painting. ” WILL HEINRICH

Few artist have given the drawn line a many meaning a Lewis . On paper it dizzying suggestion include calligraphy , figure and abstraction ; natural growth , runaway cursive and mapping . On canvas like “ Industrial Night ” and “ Orpheus ” and some marvelous untitled one , Lewis ’ s line flicker — bolt of tensile energy amid cloud of atmospheric color — expressing a vision at once opulent and disciplined , modest and encompassing .

 Your ride is ( almost ) here , but how much is it worth ? Uber ’ s widely anticipated initial public offering , on track for early May , is said to aim for a valuation of $ 90 billion to $ 100 billion . That ’ s significantly lower than the $ 120 billion that many investor had expected , although it would still be the largest I.P.O . since 2014 . Why the falling number ? For one thing , the ride-sharing company lost $ 1.8 billion last year , and it growth is slowing . Plus , everyone ha been taking note of what happened after the recent I.P.O . of Uber ’ s smaller rival Lyft . Its share have already dropped roughly 20 percent below their offering price .
 The National Enquirer , the checkout-line mainstay known for peddling headline about alien on the moon and , more recently , aiding President Trump ’ s 2016 candidacy , is for sale . The tabloid is led by David J. Pecker , a longtime friend of Mr. Trump ’ s , and there ’ s word of a surprising potential buyer : the billionaire Ron Burkle , a Democratic donor with tie to former President Bill Clinton . The publication came under scrutiny for helping Mr. Trump ’ s political rise by buying the right to a story from a Playboy model who said she had an affair with him and then never publishing it — a tabloid practice known a catch-and-kill . The Enquirer is now under federal investigation for claim that it threatened Amazon ’ s founder , Jeff Bezos , with “ extortion and blackmail ” after exposing detail about his extramarital affair .
 Just what no one wanted : Six more month of Brexit drama . European Union leader agreed on Wednesday to extend Britain ’ s withdrawal deadline — again — this time to Oct. 31 . Now , British lawmaker will have more time to argue over their long-overdue departure plan , which they ’ ve already had three year to discus . While they haggle , business will continue to plan for the worst until Brexit trade policy are settled , compromising the country ’ s economic growth . On the upside , Britain did not crash out of the bloc on Friday without a deal , which could have wreaked economic havoc . But is the extension just prolonging the inevitable ?

 Thursday is the deadline for Tesla ’ s chief executive , Elon Musk , and the Securities and Exchange Commission to work out their difference on Mr. Musk ’ s Twitter practice . A federal judge in New York ha asked both party to submit a joint letter with clear guideline about Mr. Musk ’ s tweet — namely , when Mr. Musk must get approval from a Tesla lawyer before posting . The S.E.C . sought more oversight of Mr. Musk ’ s communication after he tweeted erroneous information about Tesla more than once , first about taking the company private and later about it production number . ( Presumably , he will be allowed to keep tweeting about cheese-related flatulence and multicolored squirrel whenever he plea , a he recently did . )
 A jury will get to decide whether Apple owes money to the chip manufacturer Qualcomm , which might sound dull if not for the cast of tech star involved . Apple ’ s chief executive , Tim Cook , and Steve Mollenkopf , his counterpart at Qualcomm , are both expected to take the stand at the trial , which begin in San Diego this week . Top brass from other technology company , like the manufacturing giant Foxconn , are also expected to testify . The showdown is a culmination of a two-year global fight between tech giant , with Qualcomm seeking back payment for chip used in iPhones and Apple disputing Qualcomm ’ s claim to certain technology .
 More big bank will release their first-quarter earnings this coming week , and the result may be stronger than expected if JPMorgan ’ s report on Friday wa any indication . Analysts had lowered their projection for bank profit in recent month for a mix of reason , including the slowing economy and the Federal Reserve ’ s changing stance on interest rate . Banks ’ performance are often seen a a litmus test for overall economic health , and the latest number may offer clue to how much we should be worried about a recession — or whether we ’ re overly paranoid .
 Disney unveiled plan to take on Netflix with it own streaming service , which will cost $ 7 a month when it becomes available on Nov. 12 . In other news , J . Crew is considering a spinoff of it smaller , fast-growing brand Madewell to raise some much-needed cash .

 The tabloid featured the burning World Trade Center tower and a partial quote from Representative Omar on a cover that protester fear could incite violence against Muslims .
 By Christina Goldbaum
 [ What you need to know to start the day : Get New York Today in your inbox . ]
 The New York Post came under a barrage of criticism last week for a front page that featured a Sept. 11 photograph of the World Trade Center in flame and an isolated quote from a Muslim member of Congress , Ilhan Omar .
 “ Here ’ s your something . 2,977 people dead by terrorism , ” Thursday ’ s boldface headline screamed .
 Twitter erupted in outrage , and message began to fly on Facebook and in WhatsApp group for Yemeni-Americans in New York expressing fear that the newspaper cover would incite anti-Muslim violence . By Saturday morning , 10 of the most prominent Yemeni bodega owner in New York had agreed to stop selling the paper , and Yemeni taxi driver began delivering flier explaining the boycott to other Yemeni-owned store .
 On Sunday , the influential Yemeni American Merchant Association announced a formal boycott of the paper at a news conference outside the News Corporation building in Midtown Manhattan that house The New York Post and The Wall Street Journal .
 “ We support free speech , but we will not accept the incitement of violence against Muslims , ” said Debbie Almontaser , the secretary of the board of director for the merchant association .
 The quotation from Ms. Omar that appeared on the cover had been pulled from a speech she gave last month at an event for the Council on American-Islamic Relations . “ CAIR wa founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of u were starting to lose access to our civil liberty , ” said Ms. Omar , a Democrat from Minnesota who wa elected in November .
 The front page suggesting that Ms. Omar had been dismissive of Sept. 11 sent chill through the city ’ s Muslim-American community , and leader said they feared the imagery could stoke additional anti-Muslim sentiment .
 “ What The New York Post is doing is endangering the life of American Muslims and people of color , ” Ms. Almontaser said .
 The merchant group demanded that the paper apologize to Ms. Omar and the Muslim-American community in New York . It also urged the tabloid newspaper ’ s editor in chief , Stephen Lynch , to step down and for company to pull advertising from the paper .
 A spokeswoman for News Corporation declined to comment on the boycott .
 News Corporation , The New York Post ’ s parent company , is owned by the medium mogul Rupert Murdoch , who also owns Fox News . Mr. Murdoch retained control of the medium company after selling it former parent company , 21st Century Fox , to the Walt Disney Company in March .
 Yemeni store owner can not “ be in the business of spreading racism and hate , ” said Ibraham Qatabi , a Yemeni-American activist from Bay Ridge , Brooklyn , who helped organize the boycott .
 “ We need to stand up for justice and encourage Yemeni-Americans and the broader community in New York to do the same , ” Mr. Qatabi said .
 Yemeni-Americans own between 4,000 and 6,000 of the roughly 10,000 bodega operating in New York City , according to the merchant association .
 Two year ago , Yemeni-owned bodega and grocery store closed their shop for a day in protest of President Trump ’ s travel ban , and thousand of Yemeni-Americans poured into the plaza at Borough Hall in Brooklyn to rally against the ban .
 “ I wa shocked . How a newspaper in New York City would do a front page like that is crazy , ” said Mohammed Alsebri , a Yemeni Uber driver in New York . “ It make u le safe , because ignorant people will read these word and attack any Muslim , just like they did after 9/11 . We are going to go through that all over again . ”
 Yemeni-American leader met on Saturday night in Bay Ridge to organize the boycott under the fluorescent light of the merchant association ’ s office on Fifth Avenue . Personal story about anti-Muslim attack in New York quickly took over the conversation .
 Somia Elrowmeim , founder of the Union of Arab Women , said that the window of a mosque ’ s classroom in Manhattan , where she teach 200 young Muslim woman , were smashed last year .
 Abdul Mubarez , president of the merchant association , said he stopped sitting at the back of his mosque after the deadly attack on a mosque in Christchurch , New Zealand , last month , fearing that his mosque could be next .
 “ Now almost every person that go to the mosque , especially on Friday , feel like maybe this mosque is going to be attacked , this is the mentality that people have , ” he said .
 After receiving a call from Mr. Mubarez about the boycott , one bodega owner , Saleh Musa , refused to accept the stack of New York Posts that were delivered to his shop the next day . He said he ha instructed worker at the three bodega he owns to spread the word to other bodega nearby .
 “ If we don ’ t stop selling it , they are not going to change , ” Mr. Musa said . “ This is the city that welcome everybody . If we can ’ t live safely in New York City , where can we live ? ”

 There wa much to celebrate last spring when Ariel Emanuel , the chief executive of the talent agency Endeavor , helped throw a splashy Hollywood party for Saudi Arabia ’ s crown prince , Mohammed bin Salman .
 The soiree , with guest including the Disney chief executive Robert A. Iger , the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and the former N.B.A . star Kobe Bryant , took place a Saudi Arabia ’ s government investment fund wa completing an agreement to invest $ 400 million in Mr. Emanuel ’ s firm . The deal wa meant to finance Endeavor ’ s growth , while diversifying Saudi Arabia ’ s economy via the talent agency ’ s work in sport , event , modeling and television and film production .
 Less than a year after the star-studded party , Endeavor and Saudi Arabia have gone through a messy breakup , set in motion by the murder last October of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi .
 In recent week , Mr. Emanuel ’ s firm returned the $ 400 million investment , effectively severing Endeavor ’ s relationship with Saudi leader , according to two people with knowledge of the transaction .
 It is one of the few instance of a major company halting business with the wealthy kingdom to protest it agent ’ assassination of a journalist .
 A spokesman for Saudi Arabia ’ s Public Investment Fund , or PIF , which made the investment in Endeavor , did not respond to repeated request for comment . Neither did Mr. Emanuel .
 Prince Mohammed ha worked to turn the fund into a global investment giant whose profit can reduce the kingdom ’ s dependency on oil . On a high-profile tour of the United States last spring , the prince met with politician , business leader and celebrity . Many hailed him a a valuable business partner and a potentially transformative figure in the Middle East .
 On the prince ’ s American trip , the fund signed deal with the movie-theater company AMC and the amusement-park operator Six Flags to expand into Saudi Arabia . And it completed the investment with Endeavor , an alliance that Prince Mohammed hoped would lift the kingdom ’ s nascent entertainment sector .
 Then Mr. Khashoggi ’ s murder in October led to an international outcry .
 Richard Branson , founder of the British medium and technology conglomerate Virgin Group , suspended talk with the Saudi fund over potential investment in his space-travel business . Executives from the private-equity firm Blackstone Group , the ride-sharing service Uber and Goldman Sachs canceled plan to attend a major investment conference in Riyadh , the Saudi capital .
 Mr. Emanuel joined the chorus . At an industry event in Cannes , France , on Oct. 15 , he called the Khashoggi disappearance , about which many detail had not yet emerged , “ very , very concerning , really concerning . It ’ s upsetting . ”
 Privately , Mr. Emanuel informed official with the Saudi fund that he intended to return the $ 400 million that it had invested . Worried about the Saudi reaction , he began traveling at time with bodyguard , according to a person briefed on the matter .
 Mr. Emanuel canvassed other investor , including some who already had put money into Endeavor , to help fill the void that would be left when the firm returned the Saudi money , according to the two people familiar with the talk , including one who is an Endeavor investor .
 The process wrapped up in the past few week , with Endeavor investor kicking in money and the company repaying Saudi Arabia .
 Endeavor ’ s clean break with the kingdom ha made it an outlier in the business community .
 Despite the American sanction against 17 Saudis said to have been involved with Mr. Khashoggi ’ s killing , on top of the public outcry , most of the kingdom ’ s overseas partnership have remained intact . Blackstone is using billion of dollar of Saudi money to invest in United States infrastructure project . The asset manager BlackRock ha said it will continue to manage Saudi fund . And Uber and other company that accepted money from the Saudi government have not indicated any plan to return it .
 “ People still want sovereign wealth fund money , ” said Michael Maduell , president of the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute , which provides research on government investment fund .
 Greg Fairchild , who teach business ethic at the University of Virginia ’ s Darden School , said there wa a strong argument for corporate leader to follow Mr. Emanuel ’ s lead .
 While it might hurt in the short term , he said , “ you can look in the mirror and say , ‘ We ’ re just not involved in that . ’ ”
 Ben Hubbard reported from Beirut , Lebanon .

 LOS ANGELES — Netflix called it “ ‘ Roma ’ Experience Day . ”
 On a Sunday in December , the streaming giant rented two soundstages on a historic movie lot in Hollywood to evangelize for “ Roma , ” Alfonso Cuarón ’ s art film about a domestic worker in Mexico . Oscar voter perused a museum-style exhibit of “ Roma ” costume . Mr. Cuarón and his crew sat for hour of panel discussion .
 Breakfast ? Lunch ? Provided . There were “ Roma ” sticker , and “ Roma ” -stamped chocolate . Attendees were even superimposed into a “ Roma ” scene to share online .
 All of it struck some voter a over the top . It wa certainly a display of just how badly Netflix want an Oscar — and how much faith it ha put in the person behind the event , a strategist named Lisa Taback , to get it done .
 Ms. Taback , 55 , is an Oscar-campaign veteran who cut her teeth at Miramax with Harvey Weinstein in the 1990s and whose résumé includes best-picture winner like “ The King ’ s Speech , ” “ The Artist ” and “ Spotlight. ” Ted Sarandos , Netflix ’ s chief content officer , called Ms. Taback “ the best of the best ” when he named her vice president for talent relation and award in July , adding that he wanted to “ expand and deepen our effort to celebrate the incredible creator and talent who bring their dream project to Netflix . ”
 The hiring went off like a sonic boom in Hollywood , reverberating to the highest level of rival studio . “ Awards Landscape Rocked a Netflix Poaches Leading Strategist , ” the Hollywood Reporter headline read . Netflix had aided it own award operation while dealing a blow to competitor by taking a top campaigner off the market .
 And now the costly Oscar push that Ms. Taback ha orchestrated for “ Roma ” is starting to look historic . Mr. Cuarón ’ s film , shot in Spanish and Mixtec and deemed a masterpiece by many critic , head into the 91st Academy Awards next Sunday a a strong contender to win the Oscar for best picture . If Netflix notch it first such triumph , “ the game change forever , ” said Marty Kaplan , the Norman Lear professor of entertainment , medium and society at the University of Southern California .
 If a film primarily distributed online win , the debate in Hollywood about what constitutes cinema is over . It would strike a blow to the big multiplex chain , which have refused to show “ Roma ” because Netflix offered them an exclusive play period of only three week ; three month is the norm . As far a box office figure , Netflix ha said the film ha appeared in about 250 theater in the United States since it wa released on Nov. 21 , but it refuse to disclose ticket sale . A win by “ Roma ” could embolden old-line studio like Universal and Warner Bros. to shorten their own theatrical “ window . ”
 Winning would also make it easier for Netflix to compete with traditional studio for top filmmaker . ( Its lone Oscar for a feature-length film to date ha been best documentary , in 2018 . ) Even victory in lesser category — “ Roma ” ha 10 nomination in total and “ The Ballad of Buster Scruggs ” earned three more — would buoy the Netflix brand , giving the company a glow of excellence and helping it defend against a coming onslaught of competitor . Disney , WarnerMedia and Apple are all introducing megawatt streaming service this year .
 Ms. Taback declined to comment for this article . Strategists like Ms. Taback try to avoid the medium spotlight , especially before the Oscars , contending that they don ’ t want to take attention away from the film . Another reason , of course , is that no studio want to look like it is trying to manipulate voter .
 With so much at stake , Netflix ha empowered Ms. Taback and her colleague in the company ’ s publicity department to mount a big , bombastic , back-up-the-Brink ’ s-trucks campaign . “ Roma , ” a black-and-white period film with no known star , cost just $ 15 million to make , but the company ha spent an estimated $ 25 million to $ 30 million on promotion . Some rival company , yowling behind the scene about overspending by Netflix , insist those figure are conservative . Netflix insider have howled back , saying that some of it spending ha been to advertise “ Roma ” to consumer .
 Whatever the cost , the campaign is easily the most lavish in history for a foreign-language film . ( No foreign film ha ever won best picture . )
 In truth , no film win the top Oscar unless it ’ s paid for . All eight of this year ’ s nominee have been draped in for-your-consideration campaign for month . Awards strategist estimate that Warner Bros. ha spent around $ 20 million to promote “ A Star Is Born , ” with that film ’ s director , Bradley Cooper , flying private to campaign stop in New York , Los Angeles and London . Disney ha not been stingy with it campaign for “ Black Panther , ” which ha included television spot , lavish ad in The Los Angeles Times and stumping by Oprah Winfrey .
 Universal sent a bound volume of five book to voter on behalf of “ First Man , ” in addition to an annotated copy of the screenplay . It didn ’ t help much : “ First Man ” received four Oscar nomination but wa shut out of the marquee category .
 This ha been one of the most rough-and-tumble Oscar season in memory . Backstabbing and subterfuge are always part of this game , but the vote-mongering ha grown more intense than usual , in part because there ha been no clear front-runner for best picture . “ BlacKkKlansman , ” “ Roma , ” “ Green Book ” and “ Black Panther ” are in a dogfight for the prize .
 “ Competition ha never been more fierce because it seems there is a battle for the future of Hollywood , the film industry and the Oscars themselves — not just in term of saving the telecast from plummeting rating , but also in term of Netflix having a seat at the table , ” said Sasha Stone , a longtime Oscar observer who run the blog AwardsDaily . “ Whether publicist- or civilian-driven , ” Ms. Stone added , whisper campaign and the resurfacing of old Twitter post have been widespread .
 Ms. Taback is not the only award strategist involved in this year ’ s race who used to work for Mr. Weinstein , who is credited with turning Oscar campaigning into a blood sport . Tony Angellotti ha led the “ Green Book ” get-out-the-vote effort ; he helped Mr. Weinstein push film like “ The English Patient ” and “ Shakespeare in Love ” to best-picture victory in the 1990s . “ BlacKkKlansman ” ha been steered by Dani Weinstein ( no relation ) , who served a the Weinstein Company ’ s publicity chief from 2012 to 2016 . Cynthia Swartz , who spent the 1990s at Miramax , ha been consulting on both “ BlacKkKlansman ” and “ Black Panther . ”
 Even so , Ms. Taback is the only one to work for Netflix , which ha poured money into it hunt for Emmys and Oscars on a scale that Hollywood executive say they have rarely if ever seen before . Most studio , for instance , sent a couple of movie on DVD to voter for consideration this season . Netflix sent 17 .
 A Netflix spokesman said this reflected the large number of film the company is now producing , which is why , unlike most Hollywood studio , it decided to bring it entire award effort in-house .
 Ms. Taback , who grew up in Los Gatos , Calif. , where Netflix is based , previously ran her own company , LT-LA Communications , and in recent year worked for studio like Lionsgate , A24 , Sony Pictures and 20th Century Fox . She brought her entire LT-LA staff to Netflix , where the award department now ha roughly 20 people .
 The “ Roma ” campaign started in some way on Aug. 13 , when Ms. Taback and Netflix ’ s film publicity chief , Julie Fontaine , got buzz started by inviting a handful of film reporter ( this one included ) to an off-the-record cocktail party and screening of footage . Mr. Cuarón wa on hand to chat afterward .
 Then came screening for the film at a string of important festival . As the campaign intensified , Netflix had celebrity like Angelina Jolie and Charlize Theron host “ tastemaker ” screening in Hollywood for Oscar voter . There were party at restaurant like Spago in Los Angeles and the Pool in New York .
 Additionally , mailer went out to voter of award group that are important stop on the route to the Oscars : an elaborate pamphlet containing a digital player that ran the “ Roma ” trailer on loop ; Mexican chocolate with a note ( “ ! FELICES FIESTAS ! ” ) from one of the film ’ s actress ; a six-pound , $ 175 book of still .
 A barrage of ad in Los Angeles — in trade publication , on Netflix-owned billboard — continued for month .
 Everyone who matter in Hollywood know Ms. Taback , and they all seem to have a strong opinion . Admirers call her “ brilliant ” and “ scrappy ” — a “ general ” who figure out clever way to connect film to the cultural moment . Detractors complain that she is ruthless and take more credit for campaign than she sometimes deserves .
 “ Am I a ruthless tiger about pushing someone out of the way ? No . My strategy ha never been that , ” Ms. Taback told the trade news site Deadline in 2017 . “ My strategy ha been to be tireless . I ’ ll take clever over nasty any day of the week . ”

 The new animated Lego movie is pretty much like the last one . Or maybe I ’ m thinking of another one , not that it much matter . There are difference between edition , most fairly negligible . The unifying factor , to note the obvious about the state of big-screen child ’ s entertainment , is that they are all feature-length commercial . The “ Transformers ” series helped pave the way for Legos by flipping the old idea that movie ( like “ Star Wars ” ) were the creative source for the licensed merch , the lunchboxes and action figure . Now , toy , board game and so on are sometimes the originating point .
 This isn ’ t news ; I know it , you know it . But it seems worth repeating again and ad infinitum , especially given that “ The Lego Movie 2 : The Second Part ” isn ’ t a distractingly fun , shiny and bright a the more satisfying franchise installment . It drag and sometimes bore , which make it easier for your mind to drift elsewhere , to thought of family , deadline , chore , the creative impoverishment of the big studio and the casual , fundamentally corrupt commercial exploitation of the child audience . Put differently , what distinguishes this from the better Lego movie is that they ’ re good commercial .
 The new one wa written by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller , the franchise ’ s brain trust , and directed by Mike Mitchell , whose credit include “ Trolls , ” another toy-based feature . “ The Lego Movie 2 ” mostly take place in Bricksburg , the happy town where once upon a time in the buoyant 2014 movie , Emmet ( voiced by Chris Pratt ) , an upbeat dude in an orange vest , triumphed to become a heroic master builder . Five year later , life in Bricksburg ha turned into a George Miller-esque dystopian hellscape . Emmet still look on the sunny side , but everyone else , including his pal , Lucy ( Elizabeth Banks ) , look like Lilliputian refugee in their own decrepit and sand-swept “ Mad Max . ”
 That sound more promising than what transpires in the movie , a busy , noisy clutter of action sequence , pop-cultural allusion , life lesson and cute critter . The clever if rather cynical , self-reflexive back story involves live-action scene of a bickering big brother and little sister who , unbeknown to Bricksburg , are the true master builder . The child ’ s disharmony make trouble in their play world , draining it of color and optimism ; in other word , everything is not awesome , to borrow the franchise ’ s insanely catchy theme song . There ’ s a tidy message here : Be nice to your kid sister , which is supernice advice especially because the movie wa produced , directed and written almost entirely by men .
 The exception is the animation director , Trisha Gum , who worked with Mitchell on the movie ’ s look and feel , which is by turn immersive and wittily distancing , a when the Bricksburg story is interrupted by a shot of a toy dangling from a string . One pleasure of the Lego movie is how they personalize generic plastic brick , creating a sense of life by combining scratch and other sign of the human hand — a if a child had used and reused these toy — with distinct , caricatured voice . Will Arnett ’ s demented take on Batman remains the standout , and it ’ s disappointing that he isn ’ t given more to do . In line with the live-action sibling , the under-inspired Emmet and Lucy drive the Bricksburg part .
 Much of the story involves an eerily smiley alien land ( shade of Camazotz in “ A Wrinkle in Time ” ) where Batman is to marry the polymorphous queen ( Tiffany Haddish ) . Every so often , the kid and their mom ( Maya Rudolph ) pop up in the live-action scene , and their family dissonance creates chaos and intimation of doom in Bricksburg until it doesn ’ t .
 The moral is that we should play nice , but also buy truckloads of Legos . In this respect , this sale pitch fit in with something that Walt Disney , a marketing genius , once said about his company not catering “ to the child but to the child in the adult. ” He wa talking about his film ’ viewer , who also happened to be the folk destined to foot the toy bill .

 Maroon 5 — a quasi-soul , quasi-rock , utterly funkless band — wa the main attraction at the Super Bowl halftime show at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta , likely the third or eighth or maybe 14th choice for a headliner .
 In a year in which the Super Bowl halftime show ha become a referendum on political mindfulness , in which the N.F.L . ha become a staging ground for conversation about racial justice in America , Maroon 5 wa a cynically apt choice . It is neutral , inoffensive , sleek without promising too much . For nearly two decade , it ha been wildly popular without leaving much of a musical mark , a easy to forget a mild weather .
 And the band did no better during it 13 and a half minute onstage , in a performance that wa dynamically flat , mushy at the edge , worthy of something much worse than derision : a shrug . It wa an inessential performance from a band that might have lost some moral authority if it had any moral authority to lose .
 Perhaps for the N.F.L. , which probably sought to make the halftime performance a anodyne a possible , this wa a victory .
 But what saddle Maroon 5 a a band — it propensity to pretend lithe thing are thumping , it commitment to thinning out the soul and rock of the 1970s and 1980s until they ’ re so brittle they might snap — doomed this performance , which blithely skated through a half-dozen of the band ’ s hit .
 [ Never miss a pop music story : Get our weekly newsletter , Louder . ]
 And in a year in which the political valence of the halftime show mattered more than ever , the band ’ s stubborn resistance wa glaring . The N.F.L . canceled the traditional news conference for performer this year , looking to avoid a fiasco . But the frontman Adam Levine did do an interview with “ Entertainment Tonight ” in which he suggested that the choice to perform at the halftime show trigger in some an “ insatiable urge to hate a little bit . ”
 “ No one thought about it more than I did , ” he added , not very reassuringly . “ I ’ m not in the right profession if I can ’ t handle a little bit of controversy . ”
 Efforts to blunt Maroon 5 ’ s dullness , and it political aversion , were being made for week before the formal announcement that it would be the headliner . In December , Variety reported that the band had approached a half-dozen black artist to appear a part of the performance .
 But the decision of whether to perform wa now oriented around the protest of Colin Kaepernick and other N.F.L . player , who in 2016 began taking a knee during the national anthem ( or otherwise not standing at attention ) a a mean of drawing attention to the systemic oppression of black people in this country .
 The halftime show — one of the biggest stage in pop , and also an unpaid performance on behalf of the N.F.L . — became radioactive . Perform , and be perceived a a shill for the league . ( Kaepernick is pursuing a grievance against the N.F.L. , accusing team owner of colluding to keep him from playing in the league . )
 Ultimately , Maroon 5 — a band that hasn ’ t had a Top 20 hit without a black or Latina guest performer in four year — wa joined by Travis Scott , hip-hop ’ s most energetic performer , but not one much troubled by political concern . ( Last month , Scott announced he would , in partnership with the N.F.L. , donate $ 500,000 to a nonprofit organization , Dream Corps . ) Also added to the performance wa Big Boi — one half of Outkast , and an Atlanta rap elder — which felt like an attempt at moral cover . Online petition requested all of the performer take a knee in support of Kaepernick and his goal . No one did .
 For what it ’ s worth , the toxicity of being associated with the Super Bowl didn ’ t appear to extend beyond the halftime performance . Chance the Rapper performed in a Doritos commercial ( with the Backstreet Boys ) ; 2 Chainz wa entertaining in an ad for Expensify ; Cardi B and Lil Jon tag-teamed in a Pepsi ad . Both of the pregame performance were by black artist : a taut , controlled reading of “ America the Beautiful ” by Chloe x Halle and an impressive , if Disney-saccharine , national anthem from Gladys Knight , who before the game criticized Kaepernick for making the anthem a site of protest .
 In this context , Maroon 5 wa a dead band walking : a base coat destined to be painted over . Three year ago , Beyoncé effectively hijacked Coldplay ’ s performance for one of the most rousing and politically savvy halftime performance ever . But nothing even remotely on that scale happened here . Scott and Big Boi were ushered on and offstage quickly , box that had been checked off .
 Scott bark-rapped his way through “ Sicko Mode , ” and at the end of his moment , fell backward onto the crowd , a close to his mayhem-filled live show a circumstance allowed . Big Boi emerged in a Cadillac wearing a fur coat — the most exciting moment of the whole show — and did a casual pas at Outkast ’ s “ The Way You Move , ” with Sleepy Brown . When Levine joined them for a synchronized two-step , it took him a second or two to catch the groove .

 Apple is coming to Hollywood .
 Delete that .
 Hollywood is going to Apple .
 On March 25 , a delegation of producer , studio executive and big-name actor will enter the subterranean 1,000-seat Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino , Calif. , for one of those Apple showcase , with the chief executive , Tim Cook , commanding the stage before a crowd of loyalist .
 This time around , the focus won ’ t be on the next must-have device . With iPhone sale showing sign of fatigue , the event is intended to draw attention to the company ’ s billion-dollar-plus bet on entertainment , an initiative that will put Apple in direct competition with Netflix , Amazon and HBO .
 The premiere date for the service is getting closer , with the first of a dozen or more show likely to start streaming before the year is out . At next week ’ s presentation , Apple is expected to reveal detail of what it ha been working on with star from both side of the camera like Reese Witherspoon , Jennifer Aniston , Brie Larson , Jason Momoa , Octavia Spencer , J.J. Abrams , M. Night Shyamalan and Steven Spielberg .
 The tag line , “ It ’ s show time , ” appeared prominently on the invitation . For many of the show business people , this will be their first trip to Cupertino , the corporate home of their new patron .
 Apple didn ’ t need star before , but it need them now . Although the company wa the first publicly traded American firm to be valued above $ 1 trillion , it most recent earnings report showed flat profit and falling revenue .
 So the plan now is not only to sell device , but to fill them with content . That ha led the company into the alien territory of Hollywood , where local custom can clash with Silicon Valley folkways .
 Apple is a relatively late arrival to streaming . Netflix , Amazon and Hulu have offered original programming for several year and are now formidable presence at the Emmys . In 2018 , there were nearly 500 scripted television show available in the United States , with Netflix spending at least $ 8 billion on new content . Amazon , the Walt Disney Company and Warner Media have increased their programming budget to keep pace .
 Apple ha decided to put more emphasis on it service — think Apple Music and Apple Pay — to increase revenue . The strategy will include an expansion of Apple News , which is expected to be highlighted at the showcase , and the star-studded streaming service . Apple ha negotiated with the like of HBO , Starz and Showtime to populate it screen , Bloomberg ha reported , but the centerpiece will be original programming .
 The event at the Apple Park campus in Cupertino is also meant to drive home — for iPhone fan and anyone in Hollywood who hasn ’ t been paying attention — just how many show Apple ha pulled together . Five series have completed filming . Around a half dozen more are on the verge of wrapping production , according to several people familiar with the show who were not authorized to speak publicly . And the number of original production is expected to increase in 2020 .
 With all that new material , Apple will transform itself , seemingly overnight , from a tech giant into a more general enterprise , with a slate of original entertainment offering sizable enough to put it in a league with Showtime , Hulu or FX .
 Interviews with more than a dozen people who have had dealing with Apple , all of whom said they couldn ’ t speak publicly about private discussion , suggest that , while the producer and star appreciate having another deep-pocketed company to pitch , they also have … well , let ’ s call them concern .
 Those concern have arisen from the culture clash that may inevitably come about when a tech company that is used to guarding it trade secret get involved in show business , which run on a stream of conversation , much of it of the just-between-us variety .
 Players expect to be kept in the loop . But many of the people working with Apple said they have received little or no information on how , exactly , their show will be released . Or even when they will be released , other than a vague assurance of “ later this year , probably fall. ” They also don ’ t have a clear idea of Apple ’ s marketing plan for the show . Or what their colleague in the newly built Apple stable are up to .
 Apple ’ s entertainment team is based in Culver City , Calif. , historically a center of moviemaking . It is led by two former Sony television executive , Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg , under the watch of the senior vice president of internet software and service Eddy Cue . Mr . Cue hired the Sony veteran in 2017 , after Apple rolled out it first original series , a reality show called “ Planet of the Apps , ” which wa a dud . About $ 1 billion wa set aside for them to spend on programming , and they have blown well past that amount by now .
 While Apple may be a late arrival to the streaming party , it showcase will take place two and a half week before Disney is expected to preview element of it new streaming platform , and many month before Warner Media provides detail of it version .
 Apple ’ s entertainment team ha not been totally opaque . It ha provided feedback to individual involved in the show , but it ha been tight-lipped about the marketing and rollout plan . The March 25 event may allay Hollywood ’ s concern , but several people involved in the new program have interpreted the lack of communication a a sign that there may not be a clear game plan .
 People involved in the coming series also said that Apple executive had expressed squeamishness when it come to the portrayal of technology in the show — how exactly are you using that iPhone ? Or that Mac laptop ?
 Apple wa sensitive to a reputation it earned , early on , a a home for uplifting programming , with little or no room for the gritty antihero fare that ha defined many critically acclaimed series over the last two decade , from “ The Sopranos ” onward . Executives at the company bristled when they discovered there would be scene involving crucifix in Mr. Shyamalan ’ s new thriller for the service , a The Wall Street Journal reported in September . But Apple ultimately allowed the crucifix to remain , according to two people familiar with the series .
 Apple had no comment on any aspect of it streaming plan .
 Hollywood ’ s concern have not prevented big name from making deal with the company . In all , Apple ha ordered roughly two dozen series from the like of Oprah Winfrey , Damien Chazelle , Chris Evans and others .
 The producer J.J. Abrams ha two Apple series in the work , one with Jennifer Garner , who played the lead in the Abrams-produced ABC series “ Alias , ” and a musical show starring the singer-songwriter Sara Bareilles that is about to go into production .
 Apple ha also given the green light to animated “ Peanuts ” special and child ’ s show made with Sesame Workshop , and it plan to round out it offering with film it ha acquired recently at Sundance and the Toronto International Film Festival .
 Here are the project that have either completed filming or are nearing their wrap date . They are the likeliest to appear in Apple ’ s first wave of show .
 Untitled Series With Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston
 Apple ’ s splashiest project is a behind-the-scenes series about a morning TV show . The company committed itself to two full season before seeing a script .

 Welcome to Best of Late Night , a rundown of the previous night ’ s highlight that let you sleep — and let u get paid to watch comedy . If you ’ re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV , sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendation straight to your inbox .
 Jimmy Fallon roasted Pete Buttigieg , the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend , Ind. , after he kicked off his campaign for president on Sunday . Buttigieg — who ha surged in the poll over the past few week — is the youngest candidate in the race , and he would be the youngest president in U.S. history .
 Fallon interrupted his monologue to give an impersonation of Buttigieg , slicking down his hair , rolling up the sleeve of his starched white shirt , and pitching his voice up just a notch . Mostly , he poked fun at the mayor for being wet behind the ear .
 “ By age 14 , I knew I wanted to be president of the United States . And , boy , the two year since have just flown by. ” — JIMMY FALLON , impersonating Buttigieg
 “ I ’ m a Rhodes scholar , a lieutenant in the United States Navy , and the two smartest kid in the world stacked on top of each other. ” — JIMMY FALLON , impersonating Buttigieg
 “ Nowadays , most of you recognize me from the rallying cry of hope and unity that I ’ ve stirred across the nation . But the rest of you know me from my hit series ‘ The Boy Who Became Mayor , ’ only on Disney Channel. ” — JIMMY FALLON , impersonating Buttigieg
 Most joke about Buttigieg have to do with his mouthful of a surname . But in his monologue , Jimmy Kimmel joked that his first name doesn ’ t sound very presidential , either .
 “ He would be our first openly gay president , and our first President Pete ! Which sound like a movie where Kevin James wind up in the White House , right ? ” — JIMMY KIMMEL
 When you live with your parent , do they still get to throw out your porn collection — even if you ’ re 40 year old ? That ’ s not an idle question . It ’ s currently the subject of a lawsuit in Indiana . James Corden took advantage of this slightly raunchy , more-than-slightly-depressing story .
 “ A divorced , 40-year-old man in Indiana is suing his own parent for throwing away his $ 29,000 collection of pornography . Yeah , and guess what , lady : He ’ s single ! ” — JAMES CORDEN
 “ He ’ s suing his own parent after they threw away his porn . Yeah , at least the man is consistent : He obviously like taking matter into his own hands. ” — JAMES CORDEN
 Trevor Noah , whose “ Daily Show ” is on break this week , paid a visit to “ The Late Show ” on Monday . But instead of sitting down a Stephen Colbert ’ s guest , he flipped the script .
 Noah sat behind Colbert ’ s desk and grilled him on where he get his news ( The New York Times , Drudge Report , Huffington Post , Reddit and Twitter ) , how difficult his first month at “ The Late Show ” were ( very ) , and why he doesn ’ t go out partying very often ( because the show ’ s audience , Colbert said , is “ all I care about , ” and because he ’ s 54 ) .
 “ Delta Air Lines ha announced it will be cutting it seat-recline distance in half to avoid dispute between passenger . ‘ Oh , we ’ ll find a way , ’ said a passenger holding a baby and a tuna sandwich. ” — SETH MEYERS
 “ Actress Lori Laughlin pleaded not guilty today to additional federal charge , including mail and wire fraud , in connection with the recent college admission scandal . Said her daughter : ‘ Um , how could my mom have committed mail fraud when she ’ s clearly female ? ’ ” — SETH MEYERS
 “ Woods ha had to overcome potentially career-ending injury to make it back to championship form . And it just go to show — it really doe — that you can achieve anything with hard work , perseverance and a multimillion-dollar Nike sponsorship . You can pull through. ” — JAMES CORDEN , on Tiger Woods ’ s win at the Masters on Sunday
 “ This isn ’ t good : Yesterday , Facebook and Instagram both experienced major outage . It wa terrible — people at Coachella couldn ’ t upload terrible , shaky video of all the performances. ” — JIMMY FALLON
 Here he is , folk : your next U.S. president , the talking rock .
 Conan O ’ Brien saw President Trump ’ s tweet about the fire at Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris . “ We ’ re all very grateful to the president , ” he said facetiously , “ for suggesting that in the case of fire , water and acting quickly might be the right idea . ”
 Alex Rodriguez , who is just back from attending the Masters , will get into shenanigan with Jimmy Fallon on Tuesday night .

 On Golf
 By Karen Crouse
 AUGUSTA , Ga. — The Masters is the major that Jason Day ha dreamed of winning since he turned to golf a a teenager to escape an almost certain future working in a meatpacking plant in his native Australia . Day had to be plenty tough to overcome his impoverished beginning , so it is strange that he ha become known on the PGA Tour for his fragility .
 Day ha scaled the men ’ s world ranking , but he ha also faced the depth of discomfort in the major . Sometimes he ha managed the pain , sometimes not . He withdrew during the second round of the 2012 Masters because of an ankle injury , but soldiered on at the 2015 United States Open despite having vertigo , tying for ninth . He ha played through a variety of ache , pain and illness , and he won the 2015 P.G.A . Championship . Then for a few frightening minute this week , it seemed a if Day ’ s Masters destiny would be another painful WD .
 Shortly before he made his ninth start at Augusta National , Day leaned down to kiss his toddler daughter and tweaked his back . He ha felt pain in the area all year , and on the second hole on Thursday , he had to have his back worked on by his chiropractor before he could continue .
 At that point , his goal of winning the Masters gave way to merely trying to complete 18 hole . And yet , somehow , some way , Day not only survived , he thrived . After 36 hole , he is tied for the lead at seven under par . It turn out , he wa so focused on his back , his ambition to win wa pushed to the back of his mind , freeing him to post score of two-under 70 and a second-round 67 .
 “ Augusta National , the Masters , everything that go on this week , how big it is , and the distraction of wanting to win this tournament so bad , and sometimes it is almost a blessing in disguise , ” Day said , referring to his injury . “ It just brings down the expectation of going out there and trying too hard . ”
 People behind the rope mutter , even at the Masters , where the rule of decorum are included in the spectator guide . Day ’ s mother , Dening , who made the trip from Australia to watch him play , followed him during the first round . She decided to stay behind in her room and watch Friday ’ s action on television , in part because it upset her to hear patron calling her son a big baby and the like .
 Day ha learned to turn a deaf ear to the naysayer . Last month , Day ’ s lower back flared up with pain at the Arnold Palmer Invitational , where he is a former champion , causing him to withdraw a few hole into his first round .
 Day and his wife , Ellie , took their three young child to Disney World the next day , and a family photograph ended up on social medium . That drew criticism from people who wondered how he could pull out of a golf tournament one day , only to show up at an amusement park the next .
 Day said later that he didn ’ t go on any ride but walked around the park to loosen his back , with the blessing of his doctor . Speaking before his next start , the Players Championship , where he tied for eighth , Day explained why he ignored the opinion of those outside his inner circle .
 If he allows himself to be drawn into reacting , he said , “ You don ’ t gain anything from it , other than it make you look sour or angry or bitter . ”
 Day doe listen to his wife of 10 year . He woke up on Friday in the recreational vehicle that is their house on wheel and wa moping because his back felt sore . His wife told him that this wa the Masters and that he needed to tough it out mentally .
 Her word stung , but only for a second . Then he performed a mental reboot , because of course his wife wa right . And she walk the walk ; Ellie Day covered all 18 hole of his first round on foot after slipping and bruising her arm and leg during Wednesday ’ s par-3 contest .
 “ She ’ s birthed three child and I haven ’ t , so she ’ s a lot stronger a a person than me with regard to pain , ” Day said with a laugh , adding , “ She wa trying to get me ready for today , and it ultimately did . ”
 Day had more work on his back before he hit the practice range and felt good to go . He birdied all four par 5 in his six-birdie , one-bogey round . He wa powered by grit , but also by anti-inflammatory pill .
 Day , 31 , acknowledged that he also ha taken several cortisone shot this year to be able to play . They are short-term solution that don ’ t address the problem of his chronic back injury .
 In a season a compressed a this one , with major lined up like private aircraft flying into the Augusta Regional airport this week , Day doesn ’ t consider rest an option . April is the Masters , May is the P.G.A . Championship , June is the United States Open , and July brings the British Open . And on Friday , he said surgery wa not an option .
 “ I want to stay away from that a much a possible , ” Day said . “ Once you cut yourself , you can ’ t undo what you ’ ve done in there . ”
 For Day , the key this weekend is continuing to play a if the outcome didn ’ t matter — a he did Thursday when finishing 18 hole wa his only goal .
 “ I ’ m hoping that I can take the same attitude , even though I feel pretty healthy now , ” he said .

 Stephen Colbert admitted that he ’ s happy to see President Trump and Congress apparently nearing a border security deal , which would help avert a government shutdown . But he said that he wished he could press reset on the political conversation .
 “ We ’ re supposed to care whether Trump won and Nancy lost , or Trump caved and Nancy ’ s dancing in the end zone , ” he said . “ But nothing — nothing — that ha happened in government in 2019 ha affected anyone . Where ’ s the infrastructure bill ? Where ’ s the immigration bill ? Where ’ s the fix on health care ? We are celebrating — or supposed to be celebrating — that they ’ re close to a deal to achieve the absolute minimum : having a government ! ”
 Colbert pointed to report that preparation for a possible border wall have already damaged butterfly habitat in Texas . He argued that Trump ought to have more sympathy for the insect .
 “ After all , he ’ s got a lot in common with butterfly . They ’ re both fragile creature with bright , iridescent coloring and paper-thin skin . It ’ s just that Trump ha never left the larval stage. ” — STEPHEN COLBERT
 Colbert also tweaked Democrats after he showed a clip of Representative Nita Lowey insisting that lawmaker had agreed to fund a partial “ barrier , ” but not a “ wall . ”
 “ Oh , not a wall , a barrier ! A clinching legal argument first made in the landmark case Potato v. Potato. ” — STEPHEN COLBERT
 Jimmy Kimmel isn ’ t so excited about the recent news that a sequel to the film “ Frozen ” will come out in the fall .
 “ Just when the ‘ Baby Shark ’ song ’ s finally starting to get out of our head , there ’ s a new batch of ‘ Frozen ’ song on the way . For those who don ’ t have kid , ‘ Frozen ’ is a street-legal drug for child that ’ s 10 time a addictive a ‘ Paw Patrol ’ and gummy worm combined . In this one , Disney will finally answer the question , ‘ What if we made a bunch of money again ? ’ ” — JIMMY KIMMEL
 Trevor Noah is not at all excited about Howard Schultz ’ s middle-of-the-road potential candidacy . He criticized Schultz , the former chief executive of Starbucks , for saying during a CNN town hall that he doesn ’ t “ see race . ”
 “ It would be , like , ‘ How are you going to solve black unemployment ? ’ And this guy would be like , ‘ What do you mean black unemployment ? All I see is staggering unemployment among people named Jamal . Anyway , it ’ s February , so happy History Month ! ’ ” — TREVOR NOAH
 “ Tomorrow is Valentine ’ s Day . St. Valentine , of course , wa the patron saint of seasonal marketing. ” — STEPHEN COLBERT
 “ Tomorrow , Auntie Anne ’ s is offering a special on heart-shaped pretzel . It ’ s a great deal for all you hopeless romantic taking your date to La Guardia. ” — JIMMY FALLON

 Bradley Cooper , the director and star of “ A Star Is Born , ” will be on “ The Late Show ” on Thursday . With the Oscars just 10 day away , anticipation will probably hang in the air .

 Bent on becoming a veterinarian like his grandfather and uncle , Joseph H. Boardman never forgot the epiphany that instead led to his becoming a state and federal transportation official and overseer of the nation ’ s passenger railroad .
 “ My dad walked one day with me out of the barn , and we looked at Route 69 , which go by our farm , ” he told Railway Age magazine in 2013 . “ A Greyhound bus went by . There weren ’ t many people on it , and I thought , That ’ s kind of a waste of money . ”
 But his father explained that “ there are a lot of people that need to get around that don ’ t have a car , that don ’ t have a way to get around , ” Mr. Boardman recalled , “ and it got me thinking about that fact and the necessity for connection . ”
 He later realized that his hometown , Rome , N.Y. , had prospered only because “ we had connectivity to the rest of the world ” — a canal ( the Erie ) , a railroad , a bus system . And during college , when he worked a a bus driver to make end meet , he said , “ that really started me in transportation . ”
 Mr. Boardman , who eventually became the president and chief executive of Amtrak , presiding over increase in ridership and revenue , died on March 7 in Pasco County , Fla. , where his family had a vacation home . He wa 70 and lived in Rome . His wife , Joanne , said the cause wa a stroke .
 Although his public agenda wa mobility , Mr. Boardman had a track record for longevity . He wa the second-longest-serving president of Amtrak , from 2008 to 2016 . His year at Amtrak followed a record-breaking term , from 1997 to 2005 , a New York State ’ s transportation commissioner .
 “ Putting butt in seat , ” he once said , “ ha occupied most of my career . ”
 At Amtrak , Mr. Boardman ordered new car and electric locomotive , introduced digital ticketing and prioritized safety and reliability , particularly for the 300 or so Amtrak station that provide the only public transportation into their community .
 “ Joe Boardman believed in his bone that all Americans should have the ability to choose to travel by train , ” Jim Mathews , president of the Rail Passengers Association , said in a statement .
 Joseph Houston Boardman wa born on Dec. 23 , 1948 , in Taberg , N.Y. , a hamlet in Oneida County . The second of eight child , he wa reared on a dairy farm run by his parent , Alfred and Frances ( Houston ) Boardman .
 When he wa 17 , he enlisted in the Air Force ( “ I think it wa in large part because I didn ’ t want to do the haying that summer on the farm , ” he said ) and served in Vietnam .
 When he returned home , he applied to Cornell University with the expectation of becoming a veterinarian . He figured that if he did not get into Cornell , he would join the State Police .
 He wa admitted , but he later decided to switch major . He earned a bachelor of science degree in agricultural economics from Cornell and a master ’ s in management science from the State University of New York at Binghamton .
 Mr. Boardman married Joanne Rose Griffith in 1975 . In addition to her , he is survived by their son , Joseph Jr. and Philip ; their daughter , Emily Beth Craft ; four grandchild ; his brother , James , David and William ; and his sister , Anne Hartman and Kathryn Duell .
 After managing the Rome Transit System , Mr. Boardman wa named state transportation commissioner by Gov . George E. Pataki . In 2005 , he wa appointed administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration under President George W. Bush .
 During Mr. Boardman ’ s tenure at Amtrak , ridership grew by more than a million passenger annually in 2010 , 2011 and 2012 . Trains were added , and new car were ordered to replace aging fleet .
 Mr. Boardman also championed high-speed intercity passenger service and fixing bottleneck in New York , like the century-old tunnel under the Hudson River and the cramped Pennsylvania Station .
 “ Everybody want to be in New York , the financial capital of the world , ” he said . “ If they ’ re going to stay there , this ha got to get fixed . ”
 Mustachioed and plain-spoken , Mr. Boardman wa “ a imposing a a grizzly bear , ” Allan Rutter , a former federal railroad administrator , said in a prepared statement , “ but his spirit wa Phil Harris in Disney ’ s ‘ Jungle Book ’ : warm , winsome , cheerful . ”
 Like Baloo the bear , the character voiced by Mr. Harris in the animated adaptation of Rudyard Kipling ’ s “ The Jungle Book , ” Mr. Boardman wa patient , a characteristic reflected in his management credo : “ You are held accountable for the mistake you make . There ’ s no question about it , but if you ’ re not forgiven for them , how are you going to improve for the future ? ”
 After he turned 65 and wa poised to retire , Mr. Boardman contemplated his own future connectivity .
 “ I ’ ve got two grandchild now , ” he said . “ One is in North Carolina and one is in New York . I can get to both place on the railroad . ”

 Elizabeth Frei and Benjamin Duchek connected through Tinder , the dating app , in late December 2016 , but didn ’ t meet in person until the following March . He wa stationed at the time at Fort Dix , in New Jersey , but his position a a major general ’ s aide brought him regularly to Washington , where Ms. Frei life .
 In the time before they met , the two texted often and then eventually talked every night on the telephone . That gave them a lot of time to get to know each other , so that when they did finally meet , “ We had a 12-hour first date , ” Mr. Duchek said .
 The two had found that they had much in common , and both admire the kindness that they see in each other .
 “ It ’ s what I love most about her : She never ha a mean word to say about anyone , ” he said .
 She realized she could rely on him , always . “ When you really need him there , he show up , ” Ms. Frei said . “ He doesn ’ t complain and it wa so eye-opening for me to be in a relationship where I know I can count on that person . ”
 In July , she brought him to her family ’ s lake cabin in Minnesota . “ In the first minute , my mom said to my dad , ‘ This is it . This is the one , ’ ” Ms. Frei said .
 Ms. Frei recall having had some trepidation about how her new boyfriend would feel about being thrust into the family ’ s traditional — and mandatory — Independence Day talent show . He did 100 push-ups for his talent . “ It wa such a weird situation , and he just took it head-on and enjoyed it and totally rocked it , ” she said .
 “ It wa the moment I really , really knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with Ben , ” she added .

 As fewer people apply for driver ’ s license and more take ride-sharing service , the team behind Virgin Trains USA belief this is the perfect time to make train travel a new American habit .
 By Tariro Mzezewa
 Entering the newest train station in Miami is a bit like walking into another world . With natural light streaming through floor-to-ceiling window , the modern building is bright , sleek and full of thoughtful amenity . Outlets and USB port are at every seat , free Wi-Fi is available at the entranceway , and the entire structure smell lovely , thanks to a signature scent wafting through the corridor ( grapefruit , orange and lemongrass with a touch of vanilla ) .
 The multibillion-dollar Brightline train that stop at this station offer the only private intercity passenger train service in the country . The diesel-electric system currently connects Miami , Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach . In 2021 , it will expand to Orlando , with groundbreaking scheduled for later this year . Brightline partnered with Virgin last November , and will soon be rebranded Virgin Trains USA .
 As fewer people in the United States apply for driver ’ s license and more take ride-sharing service , the team behind Virgin Trains belief that this is the perfect time to make train travel a new American habit . And they are starting with top urban area in Florida .
 “ We recognized this major mobility problem that wa starting to present itself between densely populated too-short-to-fly but too-long-to-drive area , and we saw it a an opportunity , ” said Patrick Goddard , president of Brightline .
 An alluring promise to passenger is a shorter trip . In Florida , the train stop at station along Interstate 95 , but compared to that stretch of highway , where speed average around 34 mile per hour , the train chug along at up to 79 mile per hour . That cut the hour-long drive from Fort Lauderdale to Miami in half ; the hour and a half drive between Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach is cut to 45 minute . The train ha mostly been used by commuter , but company official hope that it will appeal to more tourist .
 The MiamiCentral station will soon be home to Central Fare , a new food hall , and is a 10-minute drive from Port Miami , the busiest cruise port in the world . That station also connects to public transit option like the Metrorail and the Tri-Rail . In Orlando , station will be located at Walt Disney World and at Orlando International Airport , to entice traveler to hop onboard .
 In December , Doug Maesk and his husband took the train from their home in Fort Lauderdale to West Palm Beach for a day trip . The journey by car would have been annoying , he said , while the train ride wa very smooth and quiet .
 “ The seat were so comfortable , there wa an attendant offering snack and drink , ” Mr. Maesk said , noting that they didn ’ t travel first class . “ Just being on the train wa a nice way to spend a Sunday afternoon and it wa a really nice way to travel . ”
 He said that he and his husband are likely to use the train to Orlando to avoid the three-and-a-half to four-hour drive , and would spend the time working instead of sitting in traffic .
 “ We just wanted to try the train once , ” Mr. Maesk said . “ But now we ’ re really looking forward to them expanding to Orlando , so we can save time and be productive at the same time . ”
 Brightline ’ s Mr. Goddard said that the company , to set itself apart , ha invested deeply into the detail in it station and on it train .
 “ The transportation business is rife with story of bad experience , whether it is airplane or public transit or even a bad Uber driver , ” Mr. Goddard said . “ We wanted to be the antithesis of that . ”
 Along with it signature scent ( scented candle are also available for purchase ) , the Miami station offer a gourmet coffee shop , a play area for child and electric scooter to rent . The station and the train are A.D.A . compliant and accessible to people in wheelchair , and train bathroom are touchless . A deal with Lyft allows passenger to pay for train ticket and a ride under the same tab , and the free Wi-Fi is available from the instant you enter the station to the time you depart the train at your destination .
 Smart , Smart Plus and Select are the three class option . Tickets cost between $ 10 and $ 30 each way . Smart is the main class , which the company say is equivalent to business class and which it suggests commuter , family and group take . Smart Plus cost a bit extra and includes one complimentary snack and beverage on each trip . Select is the train ’ s first-class experience , which provides access to station lounge that offer wine and charcuterie , and scented cold hand towel .
 All passenger , regardless of their class , are allowed up to two carry-on bag for no extra fee , with an option also to check luggage . They can also bring up to one cat or dog on the train , and the company is working on allowing passenger to book seat for their pet .

 The 91st annual Academy Awards are Sunday night , the culmination of one of the strangest Oscar season in recent memory , in which the Academy ’ s attempt to deliver a shorter and more ratings-friendly broadcast ha resulted in a baffling series of ill-advised decision , meek reversal and avoidable controversy .
 A timeline :
 March 5 , 2018
 The morning after the 90th Academy Awards , the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and ABC ( the ceremony ’ s regular network ) are hit with “ the doomsday rating scenario ” : the show ’ s 26.5 million viewer were the lowest ever recorded in the show ’ s history , a nearly 20 percent drop from the previous year .
 Academy and ABC/Disney exec meet shortly thereafter to discus change that might halt the rating free-fall .
 Aug. 8 , 2018
 The Academy announces it proposed change : a three-hour cap for the 2019 telecast ( the 2018 show clocked in at nearly four ) , the presentation of “ select category ” during commercial break and the addition of a category for “ outstanding achievement in popular film . ”
 The later proposal draw the most immediate and negative response , prompting criticism of “ pandering ” to the wider audience with a “ stupid , insulting and pathetically desperate ” attempt at a “ tainted ” award .
 Sept. 6 , 2018
 The academy ’ s 54-member board vote to table the new award , at least for this year ’ s ceremony , recognizing “ the need for further discussion with our member , ” according to a statement from Dawn Hudson , the academy ’ s chief executive .
 Dec. 4 , 2018
 The Academy announces that the comedian Kevin Hart will host the 2019 ceremony . “ I am blown away simply because this ha been a goal on my list for a long time , ” Hart writes on Instagram .
 Dec. 6 , 2018
 Hart announces on Twitter that he will step down a host , following the discovery and discussion of several homophobic tweet and joke .
 Jan. 4 , 2019
 Hart appears on the daytime talk show of the two-time Oscar host Ellen DeGeneres , who offer up a lengthy defense of the comedian , and claim that member of the Academy would still like him to host .
 But in a “ Variety ” interview posted the same day , Hart insists the door is closed : “ Would I ever do it ? No , it ’ s done . It ’ s done. ” ( In a strange postscript , Dwayne “ The Rock ” Johnson later claim he wa the Academy ’ s “ first choice to host this year , ” but wa unable to take the job because of his commitment to filming “ Jumanji 2 ” — with Kevin Hart . )
 The 2019 Oscars will not have a host , for the first time since the disastrous 1989 ceremony , a.k.a . the “ Rob Lowe Sings with Snow White ” show .
 Jan. 24 , 2019
 Variety report that only two of the five Best Original Song nominee — “ Shallow ” from “ A Star is Born ” and “ All the Stars ” from “ Black Panther ” — will be performed during the ceremony , leaving the other three nominee to be “ acknowledged only during the announcement of the song nominee . ”
 Jan. 31 , 2019
 The Academy walk back the decision , announcing the performance of two more nominated song , with the final number added the following day .
 Feb. 1 , 2019
 By then , an entirely new controversy ha bubbled up : Deadline report that the previous year ’ s four acting honoree — Frances McDormand , Gary Oldman , Allison Janney and Sam Rockwell — have not been contacted to hand out this year ’ s acting prize ( per Oscar tradition ) , with The Hollywood Reporter subsequently confirming that Rockwell and Janney ’ s rep were told by the Academy that the actor would not be presenting . In a ( later deleted ) Instagram post , Janney writes , “ It ’ s looking like they are not going to honor the tradition this year . It break my heart . ”
 Feb. 6 , 2019
 The Academy announces via Twitter that the four actor in question will , in fact , “ be presenter at this year ’ s show . ”
 Feb. 11 , 2019
 After five controversy-free day , the Academy leap into it biggest fracas yet with the long-delayed announcement of the four category deemed unworthy of live broadcast : cinematography , film editing , live-action short and makeup and hairstyling .
 Criticism is swift and virulent , with twitter condemnation , angry interview and open letter abounding .
 Feb. 15 , 2019
 The Academy , once again , walk back the decision , issuing a statement that “ All Academy Awards will be presented without edits , in our traditional format . ”
 In an interview with The Times published two day later , the show ’ s lead producer , Donna Gigliotti , seems relatively unfazed : “ Any producer worth her salt is used to these kind of thing . You find a new way. ” And in a way , her calm is understandable . After all , what else could go wrong ?

 LOS ANGELES — For the first time , Hello Kitty is coming to Hollywood .
 But will a character who never talk finally get to speak ?
 Warner Bros. said on Tuesday that it New Line division and the producer Beau Flynn had persuaded the Sanrio Corporation of Tokyo — after a five-year courtship — to entrust it $ 6 billion cat to the studio for a feature film . Sanrio , which created Hello Kitty in 1974 and groomed her into a merchandising superstar , ha never brought the character to global movie screen . That ha allowed her to remain silent : Hello Kitty ha no mouth .
 Well-known intellectual property of all kind — even apps and emojis — have become coveted by movie studio like Warner a a way to compete with a free-spending Netflix and a supersized Disney . “ It ’ s a rare privilege to have the opportunity to explore the possibility of such timeless I.P. , ” Carolyn Blackwood and Richard Brener , the president of New Line , said in a statement about their feline coup .
 The film deal also involves related merchandise right and possible spinoff project . Terms were not disclosed . New Line can use roughly 20 Sanrio character , including the popular Gudetama , a disgruntled cracked egg , and My Melody , a rabbit who wear long ear warmer . ( No word about Spottie Dottie , a Dalmatian with a pink headband . )
 “ I am extremely pleased that Hello Kitty and other popular Sanrio character will be making their Hollywood debut , ” Shintaro Tsuji , Sanrio ’ s nonagenarian founder and chief executive , said in a statement , calling the cat “ a symbol of friendship . ”
 Bringing the whiskered character to global movie screen a an attraction for both child and adult , a planned , will require Warner and Sanrio to walk a tightrope . Films require character to evolve . ( A script ha not yet been written , nor writer hired . ) But if she change too much , fan will yowl .
 Licensing expert say Kitty ’ s popularity — she appears on 50,000 different product in 130 country — involves simplicity : Because the character doe not emote , people of all age and nationality can project themselves on her . A talking Kitty wa once created for a pilot cartoon series in Japan , causing fan loyal to the cat ’ s mouthless look to become apoplectic , a Sanrio designer told The New York Times in 2010 .
 Her identity ha prompted other uproar , including when the curator of a 2014 Hello Kitty exhibit at the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles , citing pushback from Sanrio , pronounced that the cutesy character wa not actually a cat .
 “ I wa corrected — very firmly , ” the curator , Christine R. Yano , said at the time . “ She ’ s a cartoon character . She is a little girl . She is a friend . But she is not a cat . She is never depicted on all four . ”
 The internet melted down . Sanrio eventually clarified it position — she is “ a personification of a cat , ” the company said — and world order wa restored .
 Mr. Flynn , the producer who chased Sanrio for the film right , declined to discus potential change to the character , including the possibility of speaking .
 “ We have some pretty exciting idea about Kitty , who always speaks from her heart , ” Mr. Flynn said , adding that it wa too early to say whether the movie would be fully animated or an animation-live action hybrid .
 Mr. Flynn , whose credit include “ Journey to the Center of the Earth , ” “ San Andreas ” and “ Requiem for a Dream , ” started his Hello Kitty quest about five year ago . It took him more than two year just to get a meeting with Mr. Tsuji , who finally agreed in 2016 . Mr. Flynn and Toby Emmerich , chairman of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group , flew to Japan and first visited Sanrio ’ s Puroland theme park , where they rode ride .
 Big-screen animation ha been a weak spot for Warner . “ The Lego Movie ” wa a smash hit for the studio in 2014 , but more recent installment in that overworked franchise have fallen short at the box office . The musical “ Smallfoot , ” released in September , wa also a disappointment .
 But Warner is working harder to become a more consistent player in animation . On Monday , Kevin Tsujihara , the studio ’ s chairman , wa given expanded responsibility for child ’ s entertainment and merchandising at WarnerMedia , which is owned by AT & T and includes property like Warner Bros. , HBO and cable channel like Cartoon Network , TNT and TBS .
 In production or development at the studio are movie that seek to revive character in the company ’ s Looney Tunes and Hanna-Barbera library , including new take on Scooby-Doo , Wile E. Coyote , the Jetsons , the Flintstones , and Tom and Jerry .
 And now come a white bobtail cat . “ In a fast-moving world inundated with content , ” said Mr. Flynn , “ Hello Kitty ha not only survived but thrived , and the reason involves what she stand for — individualism , tolerance and friendship . ”

 HONOLULU — Last year , much of Hawaii wa shocked to learn a Chicago restaurant chain owner had trademarked the name `` Aloha Poke '' and wrote to cubed fish shop around the country demanding that they stop using the Hawaiian language moniker for their own eatery . The cease-and-desist letter targeted a downtown Honolulu restaurant and a Native Hawaiian-operated restaurant in Anchorage , among others .
 Now , Hawaii lawmaker are considering adopting a resolution calling for the creation of legal protection for Native Hawaiian cultural intellectual property . The effort predates Aloha Poke , but that episode is lending a sense of urgency to a long-festering concern not unfamiliar to native culture in other part of the world .
 `` I wa frustrated at the audacity of people from outside of our community using these legal mechanism to basically bully people from our local community out of utilizing symbol and word that are important to our culture , '' said state Sen. Jarrett Keohokalole , a Native Hawaiian representing Kaneohe and Heeia .
 The resolution call on state agency and Native Hawaiian organization to form a task force to develop a legal system to `` recognize and protect '' Native Hawaiian cultural intellectual property and traditional cultural expression . It also seek protection for genetic resource , such a taro , a traditional crop that legend say is an ancestor of the Hawaiian people and that scientist have tried to genetically engineer in the past .
 The task force would be commissioned to submit it recommendation and any proposed legislation to lawmaker in three year .
 The House passed the resolution Thursday . The Senate is scheduled to vote on it Monday .
 The Aloha Poke incident echo past dispute , like when a non-Hawaiian photographer claimed copyright over an image of a woman dancing hula and Disney copyrighted a modified version of a Hawaiian chant used in a movie .
 Chicago 's Aloha Poke Co. chose a it battleground the word `` aloha '' — a term meaning love , compassion , kindness a well a hello and goodbye . It 's a term central to how Native Hawaiians treat others and how many in Hawaii — Native Hawaiian or not — try to live .
 `` It 's traumatic when thing like this happen to u — when people try to take , modify or steal what 's been in our people 's world view for generation , '' said Healani Sonoda-Pale , chairwoman of the Ka Lahui Hawaii political action committee , who testified in support of the resolution .
 Aloha Poke CEO Chris Birkinshaw did n't return message seeking comment left at his West Madison store in Chicago and on the company 's website . The company ha store in Illinois , Wisconsin , Minnesota , Florida and Washington , D.C .
 Aloha Poke Shop in Honolulu initially ignored the Chicago company 's letter , said co-founder Jeff Sampson . When the issue burst into the news , he and his partner had an attorney write their Chicago counterpart saying they would n't change their name . They explained there would be no confusion between their business because they operated far from the mainland company 's store .
 But Tasha Kahele , who is Native Hawaiian , ha spent nearly $ 10,000 so far changing her Anchorage store 's name to Lei 's Poke Stop after receiving one of the letter .
 Native Hawaiian expert note there 's a cultural clash underlying much of this . Modern European-based tradition use trademark , copyright and patent to create economic incentive and reward for creating knowledge and culture . Indigenous culture , on the other hand , is often passed on through generation and held collectively .
 `` They 're never going to sit nicely together in a box , '' said Kuhio Lewis , the CEO of the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement .
 It will be difficult to determine who would decide who can use Native Hawaiian culture and who would be able to use it . Limits may violate the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution . The task force will have to explore who can do what , Lewis said .
 `` At the least , they need to have some cultural sensitivity about how it 's used . And they need to know you ca n't be telling Native Hawaiian business they ca n't use their own language , '' Lewis said .
 The resolution point to potential model in New Zealand and Alaska , which both created signifier that indigenous people may place on their art a a mark of authenticity .
 Marie Texter of Anchorage said her late father Andy Makar — who drew , made carving from tusk , cottonwood and horn , and sewed animal skin — wa a strong believer in the Silver Hand seal for Alaska Natives .
 `` He said this is a great program because so many time the Native artwork get commercialized or used by someone else , '' she said .
 He had to fill out proof of his Indian blood — he wa mostly Yup'ik but his mother wa Athabascan — to apply .
 But Rosita Worl , president of Juneau-based Sealaska Heritage Institute , said not all Alaska Native artist apply for or use the emblem . Nor doe the program deter the sale of bogus Native art made overseas , she said . It also lack enforcement and publicity , she said .
 Charles E. Colman , a University of Hawaii law professor , said such program hold up under federal law because they do n't prohibit people from making work that resembles indigenous art . They merely wo n't allow people to say their work is produced by an indigenous person if it 's not .
 Colman belief the Aloha Poke situation , on the other hand , could be addressed within existing trademark law .
 He belief the Chicago company 's trademark could be cancelled if challenged because it 's not so well-known that it name ha developed a secondary meaning the way the word in the retailer name `` Best Buy '' have , for example .
 `` You ca n't just register a descriptive phrase unless you 've achieved a certain amount of public recognition , '' he said .

 SAN FRANCISCO — Nestlé , Epic Games and other major brand said on Wednesday that they had stopped buying advertisement on YouTube after their ad appeared on child ’ s video where pedophile had infiltrated the comment section .
 The company acted after a YouTube user posted a video this week to point out this behavior . For the most part , the video targeted by pedophile did not violate YouTube ’ s rule and were innocent enough — young girl doing gymnastics , playing Twister or stretching — but the video became overrun with suggestive remark directed at the child .
 The commenters left time stamp for part of the video that can appear compromising when paused — like a girl ’ s backside or bare leg . They also posted remark that praised the girl , asked whether they were wearing underwear , or simply carried a string of sexually suggestive emojis .
 About two year ago , hundred of company pulled money from YouTube over concern about ad showing up next to problematic content from terror or hate group and video that seemed to endanger or exploit child .
 Over the last year , many major advertiser have returned to the site after they were reassured that YouTube had made progress in flagging and dealing with problematic content more quickly .
 The video highlighting the comment , posted by the YouTube creator Matt Watson ( also known a MattsWhatItIs ) and viewed 1.75 million time since it went up on Sunday , accused YouTube of “ facilitating the sexual exploitation ” of child . Mr. Watson said YouTube ’ s recommendation system also guided predator to other similar video of minor — many of which carry advertisement for major brand .
 Chi Hea Cho , a spokeswoman for YouTube ’ s parent company , Google , said it had deleted the account and channel of people leaving the disturbing comment , deleted comment that violate it policy and reported illegal activity to the authority .
 “ Any content — including comment — that endangers minor is abhorrent and we have clear policy prohibiting this on YouTube , ” said Mrs. Cho . “ There ’ s more to be done , and we continue to work to improve and catch abuse more quickly . ”
 Many of the advertiser identified in the video and in a subsequent report by Wired — Epic Games , GNC and Nestlé ’ s company in the United States — said they had suspended advertising on YouTube . Bloomberg News reported that the Walt Disney Company also halted ad but the company didn ’ t respond to request for comment on Wednesday .
 “ When we learned of this issue , we were — and still are — absolutely horrified and reached out to YouTube to rectify this immediately , ” Senka Hadzimuratovic , a spokeswoman for the online grammar tool Grammarly , said in an email . “ We have a strict policy against advertising alongside harmful or offensive content and would never knowingly associate ourselves with channel like this . It go against everything our company stand for . ”
 In response to the latest concern , Mrs. Cho said , YouTube disabled comment on ten of million of video featuring minor and removed thousand of inappropriate comment on video with young people in them . She said YouTube had also terminated over 400 YouTube channel for comment that they left on video and reported illegal comment to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children .
 YouTube ha struggled to police child ’ s content . In late 2017 , The New York Times found that disturbing content wa showing up in YouTube ’ s child ’ s app , which is meant for user under 13 . Videos depicted the death of beloved cartoon character and real child in distressing situation .
 There have been earlier report of pedophile cruising YouTube for video of minor and leaving lewd or sexual comment . In response , YouTube said in 2017 that it would do more to “ protect family ” on it platform , pledging to remove video that endanger child and block inappropriate comment on content featuring minor .
 “ There are some real question at this point on whether YouTube is just too big to provide a safe place for child , ” said Josh Golin , executive director of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood .
 “ If you can ’ t keep pedophile from trading information in your comment section of your video then you shouldn ’ t have comment section of your video , ” Mr. Golin said . “ It ’ s a legitimate question to ask — what are the value of YouTube comment , besides to Google ’ s bottom line , that ’ s worth the horribleness that occurs there ? ”
 While YouTube ha said it deletes hundred of million of comment every quarter that violate it guideline , the lewd remark on otherwise innocent video were not flagged .
 Mr. Watson , the maker of the original video , ha come under fire from some fellow YouTube user , who have accused him of starting another “ adpocalypse ” — what many video creator called the plunge in ad revenue from the boycott in 2017 — by shedding light on the issue .
 Those critic have said in separate video online that Mr. Watson should have reported the alleged pedophile through YouTube ’ s own tool , rather than draw medium and advertiser attention to the matter and risk costing them revenue .

 LOS ANGELES — Skeletons in the social medium closet of movie star , director and screenwriter have started to haunt Hollywood on an almost weekly basis .
 Kevin Hart imploding a Oscar host after his past anti-gay ramblings on Twitter were rediscovered . Disney being caught flat-footed when old pedophilia and rape joke by James Gunn , the “ Guardians of the Galaxy ” filmmaker , resurfaced online . The studio behind “ Green Book ” racing to contain the fallout when a four-year-old anti-Muslim tweet by one of the film ’ s screenwriter began recirculating .
 Is a new “ reputation management ” firm a solution ?
 On Monday , one of Hollywood ’ s leading medium relation agency , Principal Communications , said it had started a sister company that would specialize in scrutinizing the background of entertainment figure before hiring decision were made . The new company , Foresight Solutions , will rely on the cybersleuths at Edgeworth Security , a Pennsylvania consulting firm staffed in part by former government intelligence expert .
 The service may strike some people a overly intrusive . But this kind of scrutiny is also logical for Hollywood . Nothing stay totally secret in the social medium age — even deleted tweet — and hundred of million of dollar rest on entertainment personality .
 “ These problem are only going to grow more intense , ” said Melissa Zukerman , a partner at Principal Communications , which ha client like Marvel Studios , Imax , Legendary Entertainment and the art film studio A24 . “ It ’ s the result of a collision of two thing : a new cultural intolerance for harassment and bias ; and the accessibility of everything , from a decade of Twitter post to video taken at high school party to college term paper . ”
 Ms. Zukerman and another Principal Communications partner , Paul Pflug , pointed to the furor that broke out on Friday around Ralph Northam , the Democratic governor of Virginia , after the discovery of a racist photograph on his 1984 medical school yearbook page . Mr. Northam first acknowledged that he wa one of the people in the image , which showed a person in blackface with another in a Ku Klux Klan robe . He later reversed himself and ha refused call for his resignation .
 With Edgeworth a it partner , Foresight will have the ability to review online information in 200 language , scour social medium network , search court record and even plumb the so-called dark web . Foresight will offer multiple service , but it core offering , Red Flag , involves exhaustively scrubbing a person ’ s online footprint and recommending how to remedy anything problematic — although the firm will stop short of saying whether a person should be hired at all .
 Take the situation with Mr. Hart and the Oscars . Had Foresight existed , the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences might have contacted the firm while he wa under consideration to host . Foresight ’ s research would have turned up his circa-2010 anti-gay comment . The firm would have flagged them for the academy and provided suggestion ( should the organization still want to hire him ) to address the matter : Have an apology ready , for instance , and perhaps ask Glaad , the L.G.B.T . advocacy organization , to ass whether Mr. Hart ’ s view had changed .
 “ How might something be used a a teachable moment ? ” Ms. Zukerman said . “ If you are really going to mitigate risk , you also have to take a hard look at what reparation look like . ”
 Ms. Zukerman and Mr. Pflug would not say how much Foresight ’ s service would cost .
 There are other P.R . agency ( for instance , Glover Park Group , based in New York and Washington ) and social media-related start-ups that offer version of this service . A relatively new company called Spotted , for instance , specializes in evaluating celebrity endorsement-deal risk . “ How well do you know your celebrity partner ? ” Spotted asks on it website .
 But Foresight stand out because of it partnership with Edgeworth , which is partly owned by the former chief executive of Legendary Entertainment , and because the service come from inside Hollywood . Mr. Pflug and Ms. Zukerman have deep root in the entertainment business , having worked at studio like Universal before founding Principal Communications with Hans-Dieter Kopal in 2006 .
 Despite it Edgeworth connection , Foresight will have self-imposed limitation . In announcing the company , the partner said they would “ not accept client actively trying to avert crime or discriminatory acts. ” Mr. Pflug emphasized that Foresight would also comply with privacy law and adhere to an “ aggressive ” code of conduct .
 “ Ethics and standard have to be major guidepost , ” he said .

 One of YouTube ’ s biggest celebrity found himself entangled early Friday in news coverage of the mass shooting at two mosque in New Zealand .
 A gunman who had broadcast part of the attack that left at least 49 people dead urged those watching to “ subscribe to PewDiePie , ” referring to the alias used by Felix Kjellberg , a Swede whose channel ha long dominated YouTube and courted controversy along the way .
 Mr. Kjellberg wa quick to distance himself from the shooting .
 “ I feel absolutely sickened having my name uttered by this person , ” he said on Twitter . “ My heart and thought go out to the victim , family and everyone affected by this tragedy . ”
 Mr. Kjellberg is no stranger to controversy . In recent year , he ha been embraced by some on the far right and faced criticism for his use of anti-Semitic imagery and racist and sexist language . Here is a closer look at PewDiePie and the New Zealand gunman ’ s word .
 As PewDiePie , Mr. Kjellberg ha amassed a following of 89 million YouTube subscriber over the past decade with video that feature a mix of comedic rant , commentary and video game narration .
 Though edited , the video carry an intimate , unguarded aesthetic that ha helped Mr. Kjellberg remain relevant and sought after by advertiser . According to Forbes , a sponsored video with PewDiePie can cost up to $ 450,000 . Mr. Kjellberg earned $ 15.5 million last year .

 There ’ s more to the gunman ’ s word — “ subscribe to PewDiePie ” — than meet the eye .
 Kevin Roose , a columnist for The New York Times , wrote on Friday that the message may have served two purpose : to inflame political tension and to serve a a knowing nod to those who might be watching the gunman ’ s action with approval .
 To achieve those end , the gunman , who ha not been officially identified , used a meme born out of a competition for YouTube dominance .
 Last year , T-Series , a music label and film production company based in India , emerged a a threat to PewDiePie ’ s top-ranked status on YouTube .
 In response , Mr. Kjellberg jokingly rallied his fan to stave off T-Series , even going so far a to make a comedic dis track to play up the competition . Other YouTubers got in on the fight , too , with some buying radio and display advertising .
 As with many other oft-repeated phrase online , “ subscribe to PewDiePie ” became a symbol , a meme , unto itself .
 In 2017 , Disney severed tie with Mr. Kjellberg and YouTube distanced itself from him after The Wall Street Journal identified at least nine of his video that featured anti-Semitic gesture and imagery .
 In one , a pair of men hired by Mr. Kjellberg unfurled a sign that read “ Death to All Jews ” and then laughed and danced . In another , he wear a brown military uniform , nodding along to archival footage of Hitler delivering a speech .
 Some of the video were removed and Mr. Kjellberg described the segment a joke , saying in a statement that he wa “ in no way supporting any kind of hateful attitude ” and that “ I understand that these joke were ultimately offensive . ”
 Despite those comment , member of the far-right embraced what Mr. Kjellberg had done .
 A post on The Daily Stormer , a neo-Nazi website , noted that the video raised question about Mr. Kjellberg ’ s own view , but concluded that they didn ’ t matter : “ The effect is the same ; it normalizes Nazism , and marginalizes our enemy . ”
 In an article last year , Paul MacInnes , who writes on sport and popular culture for The Guardian , faulted mainstream publication for largely ignoring Mr. Kjellberg .
 “ To call him an alt-right agitator would perhaps be unfair a he ha never publicly identified with the proto-fascist movement , ” Mr. MacInnes wrote . “ But he share much of their culture and amplifies it across the world . People should pay PewDiePie more attention . ”
 Later in 2017 , Mr. Kjellberg used a racial slur during a video game livestream , which he later described a “ extremely immature and stupid . ”
 “ I said the worst word I could possibly think of , and it just sort of slipped out and I ’ m not going to make any excuse a to why , ” he said in a video apologizing for his use of the word .
 Last year , Mr. Kjellberg got into a feud with Natalia Mogollon , another online personality famous on Twitch , where she go by the alias Alinity Divine and narrates livestreams of video game .
 In a video testing out an eye-tracking device , Mr. Kjellberg jokingly referred to woman in one of the video he watched , including Ms. Mogollon , a “ stupid Twitch thots , ” a derogatory term .
 Ms. Mogollon took offense . In an ensuing back-and-forth , Mr. Kjellberg suggested that she intentionally dress provocatively on her stream .
 “ Oh , you ’ re just playing game with the shortest skirt ever , that ’ s our fault for looking at it in any sexual way , right ? ” he said .
 A few month later , he wa criticized a insensitive for sharing a meme that made light of the singer Demi Lovato ’ s struggle with drug .

 [ After this column wa published , the academy reversed it ruling on the Oscars telecast . ]
 When it come to this year ’ s Oscars , “ short ” seems to be the buzzword .
 Just look at all the controversial decision the academy ha made over recent month in pursuit of a shorter Oscar telecast . Some of these idea have been quickly withdrawn , like reducing the number of best-song performance , though the academy continues to cling to it latest unpopular move of presenting four category during commercial break .
 While those acceptance speech will be edited into a montage shown later in the broadcast , the plan ha still drawn fire from director , editor and cinematographer whose film would be affected . But if the academy is so determined to trim the Oscar ceremony to the category the general public is most invested in , isn ’ t it time instead to have a conversation about whether the three short-film Oscars should still be part of the main show ?
 [ Fill out your Oscar ballot . ]
 You know these category , even if you rarely know the nominee . The Oscars for animated short film , documentary short and live-action short comprise one-eighth of the award given on a traditional telecast , and it ’ s here that most Oscar pool run into choppy water and the show itself often founder .
 Aside from the occasional animated short that run before a Pixar or Disney film , these work are practically unknown to the average viewer , and many of them get no meaningful theatrical distribution until they can be packaged a a collection after the nomination are announced . So why do they still take up a big chunk of the Oscar show ?
 I don ’ t mean to denigrate the accomplishment of filmmaker who toil in this medium , though this year ’ s group of nominee happens to be an awfully homogeneous lot . ( Many of the animated short are about parent taken for granted , while most of the live-action short follow young boy caught in a vortex of violence . ) I understand that making short film is hardly lucrative , and at least the Oscar telecast can provide a glamorous reward .
 Still , these category are an island unto themselves , whereas a nominee from any other race — be it an animated feature or a foreign-language film — can conceivably vie for best picture or at least be eligible for other Oscars . If there are category that have to go , these three provide the cleanest cut .
 While the short-film category have existed for decade , they originated at a time when it wa commonplace for short to receive meaningful theatrical play . ( This is why “ Tom and Jerry ” episode have seven Oscars . ) But that simply isn ’ t the case anymore , and the majority of short film can only qualify for Oscar consideration if they win specific film-festival prize or if their director rent out a Los Angeles theater for at least three day , a form of distribution that is done under the radar and make little sense .
 The path to award qualification make it hard for even the most invested fan to catch these movie , and so little time is spent on the Oscar broadcast to show u what the short are like that they can ’ t truly entice u . So if the academy is determined to retain these three category , why not give them their due in a separate event dedicated to short filmmaking ?
 This is what that organization ha done with the honorary Oscars , which are now awarded in a lavish event month before the main show . If the academy created a similar ceremony for the short film , they could potentially play in full in front of an industry audience , and the winner ’ acceptance speech need not be made in haste . It could become a must-see stop on the way to the main Oscar telecast ( which the short-film nominee could still happily attend ) , and it would make the big show much more coherent , since all the award left on the Oscar broadcast would pertain to feature-length filmmaking .
 Though this idea may seem like a no-brainer , the academy ha spent decade resisting attempt to re-evaluate the short category . Thirty year ago , the board of governor voted against a recommendation to remove them from the Oscar telecast , which The Los Angeles Times reported then wa suggested “ a a way of trimming a show that usually run longer than three hour and that ha been steadily sliding in the television ratings. ” ( Sound familiar ? )
 And though the governor from the short-film branch would seem to be an easily outvoted minority , the academy is a highly political group , and the case ha been made to various branch over the year that if the short film go , category like cinematography would be next . Paradoxically , the race for cinematography and live-action short are both caught up in this year ’ s commercial-break dragnet , though the former would almost certainly be safe if the latter went untelevised .
 If the academy is determined to make big change to the broadcast , then , short remain the obvious place to start . Relocating them may prove controversial within the board of governor , but in a year when the Oscars are willing to offend some of Hollywood ’ s most peaceable figure ( including Lin-Manuel Miranda and Ron Howard ) by breaking with tradition , shouldn ’ t this modest proposal at least be on the table ?

 A lengthy investigation by the NYT Magazine reveals how much power the Murdoch medium empire wields around the world — and the fissure that have grown within the family that control it .

 Their power is strongest in Australia . Murdoch property in the country have both pushed to repeal a carbon tax and helped topple a series of prime minister .
 Seeing Fox News a an arm of Mr. Trump ’ s White House miss a larger picture . “ It may be more accurate to say that the White House — just like the prime minister ’ office in Britain and Australia — is just one tool among many that this family use to exert influence over world event . ”
 The clan is fracturing . Lachlan Murdoch , who is now C.E.O . of the Fox Corporation , which control the family ’ s remaining holding , fought the effort to sell most of the company to Disney . He suspected his brother , James , of putting himself above the family . The two now barely speak to each other .
 Several sibling wanted to get out altogether . James and two sister , Elisabeth and Prudence , offered to sell their holding in Fox to Lachlan . Rupert Murdoch is said to have encouraged the move , but Lachlan ultimately backed off — raising question about his commitment to the company .

Later today , Liu He , China ’ s vice premier , is to meet Robert Lighthizer , the U.S. trade representative , and Steven Mnuchin , the Treasury secretary , to continue discussion .

 Canceling Brexit is not an option . “ Closer economic tie with the bloc through a custom union or membership in it single market are up for discussion and even a referendum confirming any deal ha not been excluded , Mrs. May ’ s aide said , ” Mr. Castle and Ms. Barry write .
 But the Labour Party ’ s cooperation — and E.U . approval for another delay — are not certain .

 The first musical to reach the Great White Way partly on the strength of an active , passionate grass-roots following — “ Be More Chill , ” in case you ’ re over 30 — begin preview next month .
 No wonder , then , that the fourth edition of BroadwayCon — a three-day expo targeting hard-core Broadway fan — wa a much about shill a chill .
 Spending Friday and Saturday at the New York Midtown Hilton , I saw dozen of teen and tweens in elaborate costume from show like “ Angels in America , ” “ Mean Girls , ” “ Anastasia ” and “ Newsies. ” Actors from “ Be More Chill ” rubbed elbow with fan portraying their character .
 There were singalong , fan meetups and workshop , booth jamming two “ marketplace ” floor , a well a an avalanche of panel dedicated to such topic a portraying Evan Hansen , 25 year of Disney on Broadway , auditioning , the life of stage manager , “ Harry Potter and the Cursed Child ” and “ Mean Girls . ”
 The last two show are certified hit and , you ’ d think , don ’ t need a push . Yet most of their lead actor — and Tina Fey , who wrote the book of “ Mean Girls ” — were on hand .
 BroadwayCon is the brainchild of Melissa Anelli ( the chief executive of Mischief Management , which run the convention ) and the actor Anthony Rapp ( now in the CBS series “ Star Trek : Discovery , ” but forever known to attendee a the original Mark Cohen from “ Rent ” ) . The convention ha grown steadily since it debut , in 2016 , and this edition offered nearly 200 hour of session , with 7,000 estimated attendee over three day .
 This is small potato compared to , say , Comic-Con International in San Diego and New York Comic Con , which draw about 130,000 and 250,000 people yearly . Still , it ’ s enough for BroadwayCon to flex marketing muscle .
 And just a those convention screen trailer for the latest Hollywood would-be blockbuster , BroadwayCon offered song preview from “ Hadestown , ” “ Kiss Me , Kate , ” “ Tootsie ” and “ Beetlejuice ” — all scheduled to open on Broadway later this season .
 This is expected from a convention and it mix of cosplay , fun behind-the-scenes anecdote and an emphasis on process .
 At the well-attended panel “ Creating a Character , ” Melissa Errico talked about hypnotizing herself with a YouTube video while preparing to appear in “ On a Clear Day You Can See Forever ” last year . The actress Donna Murphy described how James Lapine ’ s staging bore a direct influence on Stephen Sondheim ’ s rewrite during the creation of their 1994 musical , “ Passion. ” And the original Broadway Mary Poppins , Ashley Brown , recounted trying not to vomit while flying over the audience .
 Hayley St. James , a 24-year-old student in playwriting at Marymount Manhattan College , had come a Anatole from “ Natasha , Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812 ” on Friday and , the following day , a Karen from “ SpongeBob SquarePants. ” ( Previous cosplay outfit included the caterer Cordelia from “ Falsettos ” and William Shakespeare from “ Something Rotten ! ” )
 BroadwayCon also prompt question about the musical-theater canon . The list of top-tier golden-age musical may be set , but which of the newer show will join their rank ?
 One new show-tune classic wasn ’ t even hatched for the stage : “ Broadway , Here I Come ! ” appeared in the TV series “ Smash ” — and wa , perhaps not coincidentally , written by the “ Be More Chill ” composer Joe Iconis . At the convention , the Tony nominee Ethan Slater , of “ SpongeBob , ” sang it a part of a mash-up with Simon and Garfunkel ’ s “ Homeward Bound . ”
 The most unchallenged recent entry in the canon is “ Hamilton. ” Talia Buksbazen , 18 , said that it wa her favorite musical “ but not because I ’ m basic — it ’ s really good. ” Shade and admiration in one breath .
 Ms. Buksbazen and her sister , Rachel , 20 , were co-hosting a singalong dedicated to flop — a reverse canon that ha long had a healthy following among musical-theater aficionado . The first entry were from “ Head Over Heels , ” “ Amélie ” and “ Bonnie and Clyde. ” A “ song roulette ” offered selection from “ Seussical , ” “ American Psycho ” and “ Wonderland . ”
 It wa like being at a Bizarro version of the popular piano bar Marie ’ s Crisis — and few were old enough to drink .

 The co-working giant ’ s real product isn ’ t office space — it ’ s a new kind of “ corporate culture. “
 The co-working giant ’ s real product isn ’ t office space — it ’ s a new kind of “ corporate culture. “

 Imagine you trained an artificial intelligence on a comprehensive stock-photo set of every boutique-hotel lobby from Palm Springs to Stockholm to Milan , then connected it to a five-story 3-D printer fully furnished with pendant-dome lamp , waxy leaf and old-school hip-hop lyric . The output would be a WeWork . So much serene , lavish and mechanical attention is allocated to every detail : the neon and the daybed and the fiddle-leaf fig , the wallpaper and the playlist and the typeface . The newest iteration of it ever-emergent design concept may be indebted to Luis Barragán and Carlo Scarpa , but the degree of thought and investment that go into it terrarium construction is something it busy occupant are expected to register only a background noise . WeWorks feel voguish but never threatening ; comfortable but never shabby ; rousing but never intemperate ; detailed but never ostentatious .
 There ’ s also free top-shelf coffee , the sort of minor frill most office worker might take for granted in a way the self-employed never would . One premise of the company ’ s existence is that it ’ s good business to provide such minor luxury to the otherwise unfrilled . The coffee — and the draft kombucha , which ha come to supplement beer a WeWork distance itself from the frattier aspect of entrepreneurship — is , at any rate , only part of an environment engineered for felicitous exchange . This strategy is supported by narrow hallway , boxy plate-glass enclosure , distant bathroom and centralized fruit-water dispenser , but the company ’ s architect never indulged the belief that if they built it , people would come . The space themselves are the staging ground for yoga class , wine tasting , make-your-own-trail-mix bar and vendor workshop about how to cut cloud cost . For what remains of life outside the workplace , there are cross-promotional discount on 1-800-Flowers.com and Crunch gym membership .
 Most of u have serious reason to worry about the future of work , and it ’ s easy to object to WeWork ’ s thin consolation on the basis of aesthetic or moral principle . Once you get accustomed to the basic product , however , it ’ s hard not to find it ... pretty nice . Over the course of about a year , I stopped into location in six or seven city , and in each of them I sat in front of my computer alongside other people in front of their computer and felt at once marginally more productive and slightly le unmoored .
 [ Housecleaners , nanny , health aide and domestic worker are organizing to secure job security . Read about the new labor movement in our Future of Work issue . ]
 My “ home ” location — on North Fourth Street in Williamsburg , Brooklyn , next to the Whole Foods across from the Apple store — wa proposed to me , by WeWork ’ s unusually thoughtful and candid public-relations representative , a a particularly strong example of the company ’ s “ community layer ” at work . The “ community manager , ” Natalie , is a luminous young woman with flaming scarlet hair and a rockabilly swagger . She started a the location ’ s first front-desk associate and rose quickly to her current role a operational czar , personal concierge and on-call therapist ; she ha also been recruited , in her capacity a a “ theatrical jazz pop ” singer , to perform at companywide event . She ha first-name-basis relationship with everybody . She know when the printer by the sunglass and accessory manufacturer is going to run out , and when Ulrik , the chief executive of the Danish software-platform company that is the location ’ s largest tenant , is arriving on a red-eye and will require early-hours access . She wa quick to put together canned-food and used-clothing drive on the occasion of disaster , and encouraged everyone to sign up for a marrow-donor registry . Community manager remember people ’ s birthday and their preference in candy or whiskey and their dog ’ preference in treat .
 WeWorks feel voguish but never threatening ; comfortable but never shabby ; rousing but never intemperate ; detailed but never ostentatious .


 If Natalie wa everyone ’ s favorite quasi comptroller , it wa clear that everyone ’ s favorite quasi co-worker wa a young accountant named Mabel Luna . When she wa 18 , Mabel moved from the Dominican Republic to the Bronx . She put herself through school and worked for three of the Big Four accounting firm until she decided her heart wa not in capital market but in small company . It wa the idea of her own office , which she selected before the space had a floor , that gave her the confidence to start a business — a common sentiment at WeWork and one I heard particularly often from woman and people of color — and on move-in day , she hung up her shingle a a private C.P.A . Though she never advertised , she quickly outgrew herself ; she told me that 90 percent of her customer have come through WeWork , either via hallway run-in or through the social-networking feature of it mobile app . She had several client in the building — including a brewer of natural alcoholic kombucha , a sole-proprietor attorney and the German sunglass manufacturer by the printer — and saw herself a much more than an arm ’ s-length contractor . The only real glitch wa that her friend-client-colleagues were constantly stopping by to rap on her window with a quick question about cash flow or depreciation , or to ask if she could spare an hour for a kombucha-tasting panel or some volunteer hand-modeling . During tax season , she felt a though she had to leave WeWork to get any work done .
 The relentless sociability inspired by WeWork wa always one of the founder ’ aim , even a the composition of it membership ha changed . When the company first opened in 2010 , it space catered to entrepreneur . The founder soon understood that the increasingly fluid and anxious labor market — it condition exacerbated by the downturn but likely to exist in perpetuity — presented them with a much larger potential customer base . Uber and TaskRabbit and other labor-platform intermediary positioned themselves to match those who needed something done with those who needed something to do , but they based their recruitment drive on a cynical reading of the economic mood . The subway I took to WeWork wa plastered with tough-love ad from service like Fiverr , which made naked appeal to stoic virtue . ( “ Actually , it hasn ’ t all been done before ” ; “ In doer we trust ” ; “ Reading about starting your own business is like reading about having sex . ” )
 That sort of campaign felt manipulative : The platform ’ emphasis on self-reliance for the economically precarious merely disguised their rent-seeking . WeWork , by contrast , just charged rent . The company wa perceptive enough to realize that disaggregated worker ( or at least those of a certain class ) did not want to hear that they should just kill it on their own , bro . They wanted to hear that nobody ever can . What WeWork offered wa not just rhetoric — a more sympathetic description of the restless , fretful life of the deinstitutionalized worker — but true shelter from a pervasive sense of alienation . Where Fiverr issued an invitation to gladiatorial combat , WeWork promised a work environment remodeled for solace and dignity .
 Thus is the business model of WeWork , recently valued at $ 47 billion , now only facially about commercial subletting . All it accessory serve to buttress it real product : “ office culture ” a a service . When people at the company try to explain that culture , they invariably resort to talk of positive energy source and the obligation to heal the social fabric — a vocabulary traditionally associated with utopian architecture , 1980s academic communitarianism or ayahuasca experimentation . They affirm that all the ostensibly small incremental nicety add up to more than the sum of their part , and on some level I couldn ’ t help agreeing . The market certainly seems to . As of this January , WeWork ha 400,000 member in 425 location in 27 country , at least 30 percent of whom are employee of large existing business . This latter category ha helped double that membership in only a year . Some of these enterprise customer are merely outsourcing their facility management the way they outsource manufacturing or payroll ; others anticipate the revitalization — or even wholesale procurement — of their corporate culture . The conviction behind the rapid growth of WeWork is that the office culture of the future is likely to be the culture of the future , full stop , and that it is WeWork ’ s special vocation to bring it to market .
 The idea of “ corporate culture , ” long before it wa identified and cultivated a such , emerged a a solution to the problem of the large , distributed mass-industrial firm . Ransom Olds is credited with inventing the concept of the assembly line in 1901 , and it wa over the following decade that business began to feel an imperative to address the question of what work wa supposed to “ mean. ” This wa both an internal bottom-line matter — employee who toiled in exchange for only a paycheck were difficult to retain and unlikely to prioritize efficiency or innovation — and a social one . By midcentury , large company like the car manufacturer had come to represent the predominant institutional affiliation for legion of American men . Even if these firm had no explicit philanthropic interest in civic cohesion , they certainly had a stake in the preservation of the social order . If they could invest piecemeal labor with something like dignity , they could neutralize the political and economic threat posed by union solidarity .
 What they arrived at wa a generic set of strategy , applicable at any industrial organization , designed to help worker recognize the value of their personal contribution to the final product . The classic formulation of this approach wa Peter Drucker ’ s “ Concept of the Corporation ” ; though it ’ s now seen — if not much read — a a foundational text in the study of management , it read like a sober contribution to midcentury sociology . The simplest form of recognition is advancement . Workers , Drucker believed , ought to be viewed not a exploitable resource but a human capital to be fostered , and thus provided with the training necessary to secure a path upward . Programs like project rotation — which exposed otherwise specialized employee to the breadth of company operation — should be put in place even if they seemed , in the short term , economically irrational ; in the long term , they represented an investment in worker potential . Employees unlikely to advance might more gladly accept their place in the corporate scheme when given a holistic perspective on production : The maker of a car ’ s door hinge , for example , might be shown where his discrete , repetitive effort fit into the fully realized car .
 The anthropologist Clifford Geertz defined culture a a collective act of interpretation , the story we tell one another about ourselves in an attempt to make ongoing sense of why we do what we do . A car manufacturer could just point to a sensible Oldsmobile , something the world self-evidently needed . Because car were public good , corporate culture could easily borrow it energy from civic culture .
 It could also borrow civic culture ’ s prevailing norm — and , in turn , reinforce them . The management classic “ Built to Last ” describes how Walt Disney , for example , did not manage a corporation so much a lord over an extended brood of subordinate , each of them expected not only to abide by the letter of company decorum but also to embody it founder ’ s spirit . Hourly theme-park worker were held to an imperious standard of personal upkeep : for men , no facial hair ; for woman , no dangly earring or excessive makeup . As one biographer described it , “ When someone did , on occasion , slip in Walt ’ s presence and use a four-letter word in mixed company , the result wa always immediate dismissal , no matter what type of professional inconvenience the firing caused. ” The people making the country ’ s car could be forgiven a coarse exclamation ; the people making the country ’ s cartoon were held to a loftier code .
 As the economy shifted from industrial manufacturing to the service and knowledge sector , it became increasingly necessary for business to articulate their “ core purpose ” a an organizational and motivational principle — and a way to differentiate “ their ” ethereal knowledge work from whatever it wa other company ’ employee did . The separation of corporate culture in particular from general civic culture wa also encouraged by the ascendancy of free-market economics ; Milton Friedman told executive that their sole remit wa to tend to their own shareholder garden . Shared goal , while important , ought to be strictly values-agnostic .
 An intrinsic and well-elaborated corporate mission wa seen a a crucial competitive advantage . “ Built to Last ” examined , a a comparative case study , cultural difference in the tobacco sector . As the author put it , “ we saw in Philip Morris an esprit de corp and sense of common purpose that we simply did not see over the last 30 year at R.J. Reynolds . Philip Morris executive have appeared far more passionate about their cigarette than the executive at R.J. Reynolds . Philip Morris executive express much more defiance in their prosmoking ideology , whereas the R.J.R . folk after about 1960 did not seem to care much about the product except a a way to make money . ... The Philip Morris executive , in contrast , framed the fight over cigarette in almost self-righteous moral overtone : We have a right to smoke ; it ’ s a matter of freedom of choice . Don ’ t take away our cigarette . Don ’ t tread on me ! ” One former employee told them that “ the company forced upon her and her co-worker box of cigarette to take home with their paycheck . ”
 Implicit in all this wa the acknowledgment that corporate work wa not a clear-cut transaction but a complicated relationship . The difference between a contractor and an employee wa that the employee accepted the benefit of security and attention along with the cost of unspecified professional obligation — the sum of which could be called culture . This paternalistic ethos in mainstream corporate America ha long seemed aesthetically dour , economically inefficient and morally retrograde . “ Corporate culture ” today , when it mean anything at all , no longer encodes a set of value a a miscellany of obligation but instead represents an elevated way to package a miscellany of amenity . Given the structure of our current economy , most company understand that it ’ s in the best interest of the shareholder to call it even : They ’ ve withdrawn the Disney-like benefit a well a the Disney-like expectation and set their employee “ free . ”
 WeWork ha stepped into this breach , purporting to offer the best of both world . On the one hand , it speaks the language of autonomy : You can choose to sit at a table or a booth or a couch , you can come and go a you please , and if you rent an actual office , you can decorate it like a tiki bar or a nuclear submarine if you fancy it . On the other , however , it speaks the language of belonging , awarding freelancer like me the chance to go to office holiday party , to feel a if our life have been enlivened by the scuttlebutt around the ambiently professional boathouse . With a stable corporate culture , especially in a unionized shop , these two want aren ’ t contradictory : Solidarity among colleague can give strength and definition to any individual employee ’ s sense of independence . But in the floating economy that WeWork equips , there ’ s something uneasy about the company ’ s à la carte promise .
 'Corporate culture ' today , when it mean anything at all , no longer encodes a set of value a a miscellany of obligation but instead represents an elevated way to package a miscellany of amenity .


 The primary evidence for WeWork ’ s faith in it own corporate calling — to be the universal purveyor of energy and community — is internal . The two big collective imprinting event on the company calendar each year are Summer Camp , a tent revival , and a wintertime Summit , a three-day carnival for thousand of employee . In January last year , the event took place in a cavernous theater underneath Madison Square Garden . The ratio of M.S.G . employee to WeWork attendee seemed to be approximately one to one , and the two group faced off with a kind of looking-glass symmetry : on the one side , union sweatshirt and jacket for the electrician and security guard , and on the other , young people in “ Women of WeWork ” or “ We of Color ” or “ East Region ” or “ Created in China ” team T-shirts and sturdy outerwear over the standard-issue gray-heather CREATOR undershirt . The assembled WeWorkforce — which is , for a tech company , exceptionally diverse , gender-balanced and bizarrely attractive — had a relaxed cool that clashed with the atmosphere of corporate sentimentality . In the background , an inspirational video invited attendee to imagine “ something that ’ s greater than any one of us. ” Everyone present wa “ part of a new generation — the ‘ We ’ generation . ”
 On the first full day of internal talk , Miguel McKelvey , a founder of the company and it chief culture officer , took the stage in a purple-heather “ We of Color ” T-shirt . A keystone of company lore is that he grew up in a matriarchal collective in Oregon . ( The other founder , Adam Neumann , grew up in part on a kibbutz ; today , according to recent report , he collect million of dollar from WeWork a one of it landlord . ) McKelvey explained that thus far the company had been associated with “ entrepreneur , start-ups , freelancer , and that ’ s who we typically think of a the innovative people in our world. ” This wa a characteristic WeWork sleight of hand , insofar a he wa referring both to the employee present and to the current well of member ; the company ha a classic “ I ’ m not just the president — I ’ m also a member ” mentality . Over the last few year , he went on , “ larger company thought : WeWork seems cool . We should put our team into WeWork location . ”
 This wa all prelude to McKelvey ’ s announcement that the company wa radically expanding it courtship of enterprise customer — offering a suite of “ space a a service ” option under the new rubric Powered by We . WeWork had contrived it turnkey member culture to make freelancer and entrepreneur feel a though they worked at Google ; now WeWork would turn around and help employee at legacy business feel a though they worked at WeWork . Some company , like Liberty Mutual ( Boston ) and Nasdaq ( New York ) , have simply taken a floor or two in a WeWork location . Others , like IBM ( New York ) , have moved into entire building . WeWork ’ s most enthusiastic customer — UBS ( Weehawken , N.J. ) and Sprint ( Kansas City ) are two of the biggest example — have engaged the company ’ s bespoke service from planning through build-out to management .
 Veresh Sita , an executive in charge of this novel product line , appeared onstage and asked u to close our eye and “ imagine a workplace — imagine a workplace where you can create a life ; imagine a workplace that ’ s so much more than an office , desk and infrastructure ; imagine a workplace built on your need — physically and digitally. ” When we opened our eye , he reminded u that most people did not have that privilege . “ Eighty-five percent of employee at enterprise business do not feel engaged today . ”
 The screen behind him flashed a beige sea of barren cubicle . “ Fifty-one percent of employee at enterprise company are currently looking for a job. ” What these company needed wa a better “ workplace experience. ” Sita showed before-and-after slide of one firm ’ s transformation . The first showed a collection of yellowing chair scattered desolately around white laminate cafeteria table ; the second showed what we were to understand a the same space reborn a an open loft , with gale of natural light reflecting off the herringbone parquet and the emerald shoot of their ubiquitous succulent . “ I don ’ t know what you even call the first one , ” he said . “ Death row ? ”
 From an investor ’ s perspective , WeWork ’ s pivot to culture ha been a business necessity . The company take out large commercial lease — initially entire floor , later building — and subdivides the floor plan into “ storefront ” unit with the size and flexibility designed to suit start-ups . As plenty of discriminating observer have pointed out , this business model is vulnerable to some huge macroeconomic risk : On the “ supply ” side of commercial lease , the company ha little control over cost , while on the “ demand ” side , it ( highly elastic ) product risk feeling like an easily duplicated commodity . And so , from the perspective of both investor and customer , it ’ s paramount that WeWork not be seen a purely a real estate arbitrageur . The focus on “ culture ” affords it a kind of magical penumbra of workplace retrofuturism .
 If the company ’ s “ CultureOS ” excuse it from the harsh reality of commercial real estate , it also affords it an opportunity to differentiate it product from the “ surveillance capitalism ” of the pure technology company . It ha collected an enormous amount of workplace data and ha developed experimental desk that will feature personalized height and temperature setting , all of which could easily be exploited by productivity-hawk employer , but much of it CultureOS is oriented to “ work-life balance. ” This could be flexibly interpreted . The Summit event included a panel with two community manager at enterprise location . One wa told by a client company never to plan event on Fridays , because people just didn ’ t come in that day . But the community manager and her team went ahead and scheduled the sort of social calendar they were used to , and , she said , “ last Friday at 6:30 p.m. , there were people playing Jenga and drinking beer. ” People who would usually leave at 3 or 4 were staying later than they ever had . Remote employee were now coming in every day ; one wa suddenly around so much that he wa asked if he ’ d relocated from the suburb to the city , but the answer wa no . “ Even if I have to commute every day for five hour , ” he apparently continued , “ I want to be here . ”
 The community manager wa confident that something a casual a weekly happy hour had been revolutionary to their new client . “ Executives who would otherwise be hiding out in private office are now being peer-pressured to come out and hang with their direct report . We are destroying hierarchy . ”
 When I met McKelvey a few week later at WeWork ’ s Manhattan headquarters , he made it clear that the long-term plan wa not just to make IBM a bit more like Google but something much more grandiose . The company ’ s CultureOS wa about being “ supportive to openness and conversation ” and the “ obligation we create to each other to be good human to each other — to share a smile and some warmth. ” We ’ ve learned the hard way from social medium , he said , that “ alignment along ideological line is a shallow way of creating a human environment. ” This , McKelvey said , is what he tell his team : “ You ’ re not building work space . You ’ re here building a new infrastructure to rebuild social fabric and rebuild up the potential for human connection. ” It wa , he conceded , a “ big leap. ” But the company existed to give it a shot . “ Who am I going to need in a disaster ? The person I took a yoga class with versus the person I ’ m in the same Facebook group with ? ” The enterprise product could scale up that social infrastructure to unite million and million of people . On a hard-hat tour of WeWork ’ s new West Coast headquarters , in San Francisco ’ s Salesforce Tower , Adam Neumann told me : “ Assuming we keep up our personal growth a a company , a individual and a a company , there is no limit . Businesses , neighborhood , city — there are new city being built around the world , and we want the call from those city . ”
 WeWork is not so naïve a to think that narrow hallway , happy hour , Taco Tuesdays and yoga are going to revive the workplace a a locus of societal coherence . But it think that thousand of Natalies remembering the birthday of thousand of Mabel Lunas might , and it ’ s to it sincere credit that — unlike most other technology company , but like most religion — it recognizes that meaning at scale is a high-touch business , and it seems prepared to invest in labor cost that , even if they ’ re drawn from the low-wage hospitality sector , will grow linearly with expansion . When I spoke to representative of Powered by We customer , they were highly appreciative of a partnership that gave their employee at the very least better access to informal common space .
 And WeWork is right to perceive that it provides it member with a heightened sense of social organization . To join WeWork is to feel gently buoyed along in a strange kind of substrate , neither fully adrift nor fully anchored , loosely bound to others by novel waveform . These tie alternately resemble deal between independent contractor , collaboration between colleague , flirtation between stranger and intimacy between friend — and insofar a they muddy the boundary between these thing , they ultimately feel like none of them . There is a near-imaginable WeWorld in which all human endeavor outsources itself to association of WeNodes that in an eternal churn arise a spontaneously a they disperse . If a very clever combination of architecture , technology and hospitality serf a an analgesic for the disaggregated , it can just a easily function a a solvent for the institution that remain .
 This might not be such a bad thing , especially for certain type of “ creatives ” and “ innovator , ” but it ’ s hard to see where community will take root and culture will flower . WeWork ’ s executive might believe that people are lonely and atomized because our social infrastructure ha been degraded , but the problem is not that we lack opportunity to brush up against one another . They confuse the possibility of interaction with the incentive and desire to interact ; they confuse their own set decoration for the provision of a common script . You can not put a bunch of random actor on a stage and expect them to fumble their way toward a play . When a spirit of community doe unfold ex nihilo in one of their space , the simplest explanation is selection bias : When they open location based on proximity to a Whole Foods or an Apple store , they are masking the sorting mechanism they ’ ve used to build their brand .
 WeWork had contrived it turnkey member culture to make freelancer and entrepreneur feel a though they worked at Google ; now WeWork would turn around and help employee at legacy business feel a though they worked at WeWork .


 As for me , I never went to any of those free yoga class ; I suppose I can ’ t really speak for Williamsburg ’ s other member , but perhaps that ’ s the point . I wa an extracurricular truant in part because I liked my own yoga class just fine and in part because the WeWork event I did attend were so networky . Also , I always had too much work . It ’ s tempting to underline the paradox that , in my case , a WeWork yoga class could very plausibly have counted a work , but then again the very same could be said for any of North Fourth Street ’ s accountant or kombucha marketer — not to make ally in anticipation of disaster but to trawl for more client and contractor .
 And I didn ’ t really care to go to the holiday party either . The anarchic thrill of a masquerade is electrifying only insofar a it feel genuinely remissive : A harvest ritual only make sense a a reprieve from the collective sacrifice of the season . One thing that executive at Philip Morris and Disney understood wa that culture succeed in the attempt to organize and structure human behavior only when they address both what you are permitted to do and what you are obligated to do . “ Do what you love ” is only half a culture ; what ’ s missing is the idea that there might be some deep reward , beyond the gratification of self-discipline , for doing what you have to do even when you don ’ t love it — in other word , for doing work . An authority that can ’ t compel is not an authority that can protect or inspire .
 WeWork ’ s own precedent put it employee in an excellent position to understand this dynamic . A recent executive mandate declared the company a “ meat-free ” organization . When I interviewed McKelvey not long after the Summit , he had a very fuzzy time trying to explain the meaning of the “ eight pillar ” of it CultureOS and the relationship among them . But when he noticed that the P.R . representative happened to be carrying a single-use plastic water bottle , he admonished her to be mindful of her own consumption . For all the company ’ s vaulting ambition to build the workplace of the future , this wa much closer to Walt Disney than Milton Friedman .
 Over the past year , a WeWork ha been folded into what is now called the We Company — which encompasses WeGrow , it school , and WeLive , it communal housing project — it Powered by We product ha been refined and formalized . Recently , I met with Lakshmi Rengarajan , it director of workplace connection and a recent recruit from Match.com , and Craig Robinson , a veteran of commercial real estate who now served a global head of Powered by We Services , along with two P.R . representative ; the company ’ s data show that people prefer small conference room to medium-size one , and the five of u were pressed into intimacy by the vitrine they ’ d reserved .
 Rengarajan and Robinson were careful to italicize the idea that they ’ re not trying to foist their own strong , participatory , idiosyncratic culture on anybody else ’ s shop . Their service , while inspired by and grounded in the company ’ s internal environment , begin with WeWork ’ s tailored attempt to understand the client ’ s own organizational structure and need . They did , of course , have a repertoire of connective practice that seemed to them universally valuable . Rengarajan told me that “ the first step toward someone being seen a a full human ” wa to begin with something a simple a a round of story about where people ’ s first name came from ; she explained that a former bos , unable for some reason to pronounce the name Lakshmi , had simply called her Sue . Robinson , who had personally experienced Rengarajan ’ s exercise twice , said that the activity made it easy to remember Rengarajan because her name meant she wa born on a Monday . “ Or maybe it wasn ’ t Monday ? ”
 “ Friday , ” she said , and laughed .
 But they were not so presumptuous a to expect that Sprint or UBS would have a cafeteria that served no meat . I wondered how far they would extend themselves to help a firm help it employee to do what they loved . Would they be willing to work with , say , Philip Morris ? Everyone tried to sustain simultaneous eye contact with me while they all paused to give it some thought .
 “ That , ” each repeated in turn with total , collective sincerity , “ is a great question. ” They were going to have to talk about it .

 Having wrapped up their reviewing duty for 2018 , our chief film critic , Manohla Dargis and A. O. Scott , look back at a year of rage , silliness and sublimity at the movie and ahead to the 91st Academy Awards .
 A. O. SCOTT If I had to pick one movie moment to sum up 2018 , it would probably be the last scene of “ Support the Girls , ” Andrew Bujalski ’ s workplace comedy about the manager of a Hooters-like bar and grill in Texas . Not enough people paid attention when the film wa released in August , but Regina Hall ’ s performance ha picked up some award and nomination since then , and everyone should stream it right now .
 Anyway : The movie end with three woman — Hall , Haley Lu Richardson and Shayna McHayle — screaming on a roof . Not in terror ( a woman onscreen so often do ) , but in rage , frustration and a kind of righteous , rebellious glee . They are venting and protesting , having endured an endless cycle of everyday racism , sexism and exploitation . As an ending , it feel triumphant and bleak at the same time , which may be why I keep coming back to it .
 MANOHLA DARGIS I wa up on that roof , at least in spirit . In some way , this sisterly scream is the signature image for the past year . Scarcely a week ( a day ! ) went by without a powerful man being called out for his alleged sexual misconduct , most publicly of course during the fraught Brett Kavanaugh nomination hearing . At the same time that we were witnessing this profound reckoning , we were also seeing a number of female-driven movie , most of which — it ’ s important to recognize — had finished shooting before news of the sexual harassment accusation against Harvey Weinstein broke in October 2017 .
 Oddly , when I watched the roof interlude in “ Support the Girls ” I flashed on the scene in Bernardo Bertolucci ’ s “ Last Tango in Paris ” of Marlon Brando screaming — he ’ s cursing God — under a thundering overhead train . Bertolucci died in November , and his artistic legacy is forever linked , and rightly so , to allegation of abuse from that film ’ s co-star , Maria Schneider . In 2007 , she said that while shooting it most infamous sex scene she felt humiliated and “ a little raped , both by Marlon and by Bertolucci. ” The allegation feel emblematic of the destructive power imbalance in an industry that ha marginalized and victimized woman while giving free license to male abuse .
 No wonder woman are yelling .
 SCOTT A few year ago you and I examined the state of female representation in movie , and found that it wa improving , meaning that a wider range of role seemed to be opening up . But in retrospect a lot of those role — the variety of strong , raunchy and badass comic and action heroine who emerged in the early and middle part of this decade — look like they were designed to deflect criticism or prove a narrow point : that girl could be just a tough , violent , brave or naughty a boy . This boldness wa accompanied by a certain anxiety about losing the male audience , anticipating the tantrum that would later be thrown by some fragile “ Ghostbusters ” and “ Star Wars ” fan .

 In some way , thing haven ’ t changed so much . In a recent essay in Buzzfeed , Alison Willmore note that “ 2018 ha been a rich with slogany , simplified woman ’ s empowerment callouts a it ha been with reason for woman to be filled with rage and dread. ” She single out “ On the Basis of Sex , ” Mimi Leder ’ s film about Ruth Bader Ginsburg ’ s early career , and “ Ocean ’ s 8 , ” Gary Ross ’ s # squadgoals heist picture with a cast including Sandra Bullock , Cate Blanchett , Mindy Kaling and Rihanna .
 But the careful , superficial conventionality of those movie highlight the complexity of so many others . It ’ s worth listing some of them , just a a reminder of how much feminist argument there ha been in and about movie this year — how central the question of woman ’ s anger , power and autonomy have been in popular culture and politics more generally . In no particular order , and in addition to the one we ’ ve already named , I would mention “ Revenge , ” “ Widows , ” “ The Favourite , ” “ The Wife , ” “ Suspiria , ” “ Destroyer , ” “ Can You Ever Forgive Me ? ” “ Roma , ” “ Eighth Grade , ” “ A Wrinkle in Time , ” “ Madeline ’ s Madeline , ” “ Let the Sunshine In ” and “ A Simple Favor. ” It ’ s not that all of them offer equally plausible or positive image — they ’ re not all good movie ! — but that filmmaker seem interested in the politics of woman ’ s experience in a way that feel different . One measure of the difference is that for the first time in I don ’ t know how many year the field of potential Oscar best actress nominee look much wider and more interesting than the potential best actor .
 DARGIS It ’ s great to see so many female-driven story , though — a you say — not all are good or feminist . “ Widows ” and “ Ocean ’ s 8 ” put a spurious sisterly spin on old-fashioned American greed . Both would have been better and more honest if their character were just a openly mercenary a any male movie thief and didn ’ t try to soften these woman ’ s crime with tear and rationalization . By contrast , because “ Support the Girls ” lead with the lived-in , different truth of it character , it feminism is organic , not performative or programmatic . “ Roma ” focus on one woman , but , unlike most American movie , also look at that life in the larger world of structural oppression .
 Taken together , all these movie — the good , the bad , the blah — are welcome just because they offer an actual range of different female role and diverse idea about woman ’ s place in the world . Some of these idea are stale and the moviemaking is dreary or worse , but I ’ m glad they exist . A movie like “ The Wife , ” for instance , is so devoid of aesthetic interest that the only thing we can discus is how it frame power and gender while letting it title character — who ha been long complicit in her husband ’ s literary fraud and his exploitation of her — off the hook .
 “ The Wife ” is calibrated for maximum audience flattery : viewer are encouraged to nod in recognition at the literary milieu and clap their hand in self-congratulatory glee at the husband ’ s fall . Men , bad ; woman , good — it feminism is irritatingly reductive , but it doe make the movie topical fodder especially in 2018 , a year that ha reminded u that feminism speaks in many different voice . Some of these voice are radical and forward-thinking while others seem discouragingly stuck in the same era a , well , “ Green Book , ” yet another movie that seems mostly interested in making it audience — here , presumptively white — feel good about it own racial sensitivity .
 SCOTT I love that “ The Wife , ” most of which take place in Stockholm during the Nobel Prize ceremony , wa released shortly before the Swedish Academy canceled the literature prize because of a sexual harassment scandal . I hope someone ha optioned that kerfuffle — which is too baroque and weird to summarize — for a movie . Maybe Yorgos Lanthimos , fresh off the power game of “ The Favourite . ”
 Films like “ Sorry to Bother You , ” starring Tessa Thompson and Lakeith Stanfield , had more on their mind than comforting fable of finger-lickin ’ harmony .
 Ah yes , “ Green Book. ” It ’ s sort of mind-boggling that Peter Farrelly ’ s compendium of tone-deaf racial clichés arrived on screen in the same year a “ Sorry to Bother You , ” “ BlacKkKlansman ” and “ If Beale Street Could Talk. ” It seems to come not only from a bygone era but from a whole different cinema planet , one governed by feel-good piety that were dubious here on earth even back in the 1960s . The voting membership of the Academy circa 1987 would have given all the prize to “ Green Book , ” but in 2019 it prospect are decidedly cloudier .
 Not that Boots Riley , Spike Lee and Barry Jenkins represent a unified perspective on black life and American racism , or that they are in perfect political and imaginative harmony with one another . Hardly , and thank goodness . But all of them are interested in offering something other than comforting fable of finger-lickin ’ harmony . And even though “ Beale Street ” and “ BlacKkKlansman ” are set in the ‘ 70 , while “ Sorry ” unfolds in a speculative near-future , each one explicitly address the unfinished business of the present .
 Which is what I want : movie that , rather than arriving at pat or reassuring conclusion , embrace the complication of reality and invite the audience to really think about it . Mostly this year I found that in documentary and in other movie made at some distance from the American commercial mainstream .
 DARGIS At this point it feel a if the remaining big studio have nothing to offer other than recycled idea and brand , with some exception . I like some of the box office behemoth — mostly , I like “ Black Panther ” — but too many of them were numbingly familiar in every way , narratively , tonally , whatever . This isn ’ t new or news , but it ’ s bleak that “ Avengers : Infinity War ” receives attention simply because it is from Marvel . Each of it movie is just a delivery system for that brand , though this one did encourage me with the promise that it character and this franchise are finally goner .
 Disney ha been the dominant player for a while and , a it power ha grown , each of it new movie feel like a product launch : The release of the new Marvel , Star Wars or Pixar movie is greeted like the release of the latest iPhone , including the rabid-dog medium attention it generates . There are modification , some nifty new feature , but it ’ s mostly the same , just pricier . This seems like how thing worked in classic Hollywood cinema , which depended on both standardization ( through product quality control and storytelling norm , for instance ) and differentiation ( in the diversity of film and star and so on ) .
 The current big-studio model , though , is more focused on sameness than difference . Each new addition to the franchise can ’ t be meaningfully different enough to mess with the brand . That ’ s partly what make “ Black Panther ” interesting : It doesn ’ t just swap out one Chris for another ( Chris Hemsworth ’ s Thor instead of Chris Evans ’ s Captain America ) . It introduces idea and character that are so strong , so in excess of what we normally see — African-American identity , Afro-futurism , Michael B. Jordan ’ s performance and the very figure of Killmonger — that they become bigger and more important than the Marvel brand and story beat .
 SCOTT It turn out that when “ diversity ” mean something more than pandering or tokenism — when , a in the case of “ Black Panther , ” an African-American filmmaker can claim the freedom to explore the cultural and political valence of an African superhero — a worked-over franchise can be revivified . That ’ s what Ryan Coogler did to the Marvel Universe . ( He ’ d already done it to the “ Rocky ” cosmos with “ Creed , ” which he bequeathed to his fellow U.S.C . alum Steven Caple , Jr . )
 Something similar happened , on a more modest scale and with a more playful sensibility , in “ Spider-Man : Into the Spider-Verse , ” which brought an ingenious , unforced pluralism to the Peter Parker mythos . What if the radioactive spider happened to bite the Afro-Latino son of a police officer and a health care worker ? It ’ s a fascinating question if the answer is handled with appropriate wit and authenticity , a it wa by the gang at Sony Pictures Animation .
 Marvel Comics ha been exploring these kind of story for a while , steadily eroding the white-male monopoly on superhero status in print . I ’ m glad the movie ’ s incarnation of those story are starting to follow suit ( and not only in the Marvel universe , to be fair ) . My political quarrel with “ Black Panther ” — wait , where are you going ? — ha to do with it commitment to monarchism and to Wakanda ’ s appropriation of Silicon Valley techno-neoliberalism a it guiding ideology . Superheroism remains a profoundly anti-democratic undertaking . I wish the great Senegalese filmmaker ( and novelist , labor organizer and political gadfly ) Ousmane Sembène were still around , so he could take up the next chapter in the franchise . Or maybe Disney would hire Raoul Peck ( “ Lumumba , ” “ I Am Not Your Negro ” ) or Abderrahmane Sissako ( “ Bamako , ” “ Timbuktu ” ) to direct a stand-alone Killmonger adventure , one that rescue that misunderstood villain from the condescension of comic-book history . The next phase of the dialectic is surely the synthesis of Marvel and Marx .
 A fellow can dream , anyway .
 DARGIS Keep dreaming , and I mean that in the nicest way , comrade . That “ Black Panther ” inspires such revery — and indeed wa one of the most exciting , idea-generating movie of the year — is further proof that it difference are profound , even if it is another male-driven heroic tale . It ’ s the kind of big-studio release that make me think that the world of American industrial moviemaking isn ’ t a creative wasteland . Its impact even make me look forward to the next Oscars . ( Not really . )

 LOS ANGELES — About five year ago , Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige found himself on a retreat in Palm Springs plotting the future for the wild , experimental `` cinematic universe '' that he helped start in 2008 . He wanted to do something that they had n't done . He wanted an ending .
 And after a quick pitch to Robert Downey Jr. , he , director Anthony and Joe Russo and screenwriter Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely , started plotting a way to bring this saga to a close , brainstorming whenever they had a moment — even in between take of `` Captain America : Civil War . ''
 Anyone who saw `` Avengers : Infinity War '' know they were n't kidding around either . Thanos literally dissolved half of humanity , including Spider-Man and Black Panther in an event known a `` the snap '' that 's inspired tear , meme and more fan theory than the internet can hold . Talk about a cliffhanger .
 Endings are a rarity in the franchise movie-making business ; especially when one 's popularity ha only multiplied a the movie of Marvel have . But Marvel Studios , which ha never shied away from a little rule-breaking , is taking a sledgehammer to that old `` do n't leave money on the table '' maxim , and audience will finally be able to see how they do it when `` Avengers : Endgame '' open nationwide on April 25 .
 `` ( Ending ) is not a scary word , '' Feige said . `` It 's a necessary word . ''
 What exactly that mean for the Marvel Cinematic Universe ( MCU ) is something of a state secret . Feige said that this will be `` definitive , '' though .
 `` People can debate and discus what that mean before they see the movie , '' Feige said . `` But for u that mean bringing to a conclusion the first three phase , the first 22 film in the MCU , so that everything thereafter is a new start . ''
 So `` new '' in fact that Feige wo n't even discus what 's to come beyond the July release of `` Spider-Man : Far From Home . '' He wo n't confirm reportedly in-the-works project like the `` Black Widow '' stand-alone , `` The Eternals '' or `` Shang-Chi , '' or talk about plan for the 20th Century Fox property like `` Deadpool '' and `` X-Men '' that are now under his purview .
 They have the next five year mapped out ; they 're just not letting audience peek behind the curtain until after `` Endgame . '' It 's that big .
 `` How we leave 'Endgame ' will help define where we 're going for many people , '' Feige said .
 But how doe one talk about a movie that no press ha seen and no actor or creator are allowed to discus in detail ? Well , carefully and cryptically .
 We know some thing . That the hero left like Iron Man ( Downey Jr. ) , Captain America ( Chris Evans ) , Black Widow ( Scarlett Johansson ) , Thor ( Chris Hemsworth ) , Hulk ( Mark Ruffalo ) and War Machine ( Don Cheadle ) are dealing with the devastating loss post-snap while trying to figure out what to do with Thanos . A helpful `` Avenge the Fallen '' campaign served a a reminder of who survived and who did n't ( some of the dusted were even a surprise , like `` Black Panther 's '' Shuri ) . We also know they have a new weapon in Brie Larson 's Captain Marvel , who Samuel L. Jackson 's Nick Fury managed to page before dissolving into dust .
 Will character die , though ? Probably . Will the one lost in `` the snap , '' remain gone ? Unclear ( although some who have upcoming movie , like , say Spider-Man , wo n't ) . But the cast and filmmaker are n't giving anything up , or even commenting on the fact that this might be the last of Evans a Captain America , which the actor himself tweeted about month ago .
 `` I still do n't know what happens in this movie , '' said Larson , who actually even filmed her scene in `` Endgame '' before `` Captain Marvel , '' which came out earlier this year .
 Filming proved an emotional experience for many of the actor , a lot of whom have now been working together for almost a decade or more .
 `` I wa pretty teary-eyed , '' Evans said . `` This is the culmination of a really long endeavor . It kind of wrap up the journey for a lot of these character . ''
 It led to a lot of reflection , about where they started and how they 've grown . Johansson noted that she 'd been developing her character for 10 year now , and is excited that Black Widow ha evolved from a `` sexy secretary '' type to a more fully realized woman .
 `` The whole shoot felt pretty nostalgic , '' Hemsworth added . `` We were constantly talking about when it all started to how we pulled this off and what we were a part of . ''
 But he also admits he wa `` kind of happy to get off the set . '' An eight month shoot can wear even on Thor .
 And indeed the shoot wa grueling . The director , who did `` Winter Soldier , '' `` Civil War '' and `` Infinity War '' said it wa the hardest of their life .
 `` This went far beyond anything we 'd ever done before , '' said Anthony Russo . `` There 's a reason why movie are n't made this way normally . ''
 But that this wa unconventional wa also the draw .
 `` I think the only reason we stuck around , is because they were committed to an ending and we 're deconstructionists , '' said Joe Russo . `` We like to take thing apart and see the ramification of what happens . 'Winter Soldier ' the good guy became the bad guy , 'Civil War , ' we divorced the hero , 'Infinity War , ' we killed half of them . We like to smash it and look at how you can put the piece back together . ''
 And no one , not even Feige , regret putting the MCU on this one-way path . That 's not to say he never second guess himself , however .
 Two week before `` Infinity War '' came out he had a moment of panic about the snap .
 `` That ending wa one of the reason why we wanted to make the movie . That 's how we sold it to Disney . We were confident in it , '' Feige said . `` But then a week or two week before the film came out , I went , 'Oh no . We 're killing all these people . What if the audience totally reject it ? ' ''
 Speaking just a few week before `` Endgame '' is unleashed on the world , Feige ha found himself in a familiar spot .
 Feige said : `` It 's not until the movie is completely finished , which 'Endgame ' is now completely finished , when you ca n't touch it any more that you go , 'Wait a minute : Should we have touched it more ? ' ''

 Good Thursday . ( Want this by email ? Sign up here . )
 The C.E.O.s of seven huge American bank testified on Capitol Hill yesterday — the first time since 2009 that top Wall Street C.E.O.s have appeared en masse before Congress . Here ’ s how they responded to a grilling by House Democrats on a variety of issue .
 Banking rule : The C.E.O.s argued that the financial system is much safer today than it wa a decade ago , despite recent easing of regulation .
 Russia : Brian Moynihan of Bank of America , James Gorman of Morgan Stanley and Mike Corbat of Citigroup all said they had reviewed their account holder for potential Russian money-laundering . Mr. Corbat wa the only one to say he “ could not comment on ongoing investigation . ”
 Guns : “ JPMorgan ha refused to adopt a policy to ensure responsible lending to the gun industry , even though you claim that client selection is important , ” said Representative Carolyn Maloney . “ Will you commit to adopting a formal policy that ensures responsible lending in your bank ’ s business with the gun industry ? ” Jamie Dimon responded that JPMorgan ha “ a very small relationship with gun manufacturer , ” and added that he would be willing to consider adopting a formal policy . Mr. Gorman said Morgan Stanley had clamped down on doing business with gunmakers ; Citi and Bank of America have already done so .
 The economy : Asked about the biggest economic threat facing the U.S. , Mr. Corbat answered , “ Our ability to talk ourselves into the next recession . ”
 Diversity : Not one of the C.E.O.s thought that his successor would be a woman or a person of color .
 More : Lloyd Blankfein , the former Goldman Sachs C.E.O . who testified at the 2009 hearing , tweeted yesterday , “ Boy , I really miss my old job ! ! ! ”
 To curb disinformation and hateful content , Andrew suggests in his latest column that tech giant take a page from the banking industry and make sure they know who they ’ re doing business with .
 • “ The concept is ‘ know your customer ’ — or KYC , a it ’ s called on Wall Street — and it ’ s straightforward : Given concern about privacy , security and fraud when it come to money , no bank is allowed to take on a new customer without verifying it existence and vetting it background . ”
 • “ What if social medium company had to verify their user the same way bank do ? You ’ d probably feel more confident that you were interacting with real people and were not just a target for malicious bot . ”
 • “ When I broached the idea of applying a ‘ know your customer ’ principle to their business , several senior executive at social medium company recoiled at the prospect , questioning how they would pull off such a huge feat , especially in emerging market where many people lack credit card , and even fixed street address . ”
 • But there ’ s precedent : NextDoor , the social network focused on local community , requires user to submit a credit card or phone number , which it check against database .
 • A “ know your customer ” rule could become more important a social network like Facebook become fully encrypted . Fake user could easily spread misinformation and be harder to stop in an encrypted world — unless there wa a way to verify their identity at the outset .
 More : Facebook say it is expanding it effort to clamp down on disinformation through step like expanding fact-checking operation and reducing the reach of group that share misleading content . It ’ s also taking step to minimize unwelcome reminder of dead friend on it network .
 The ride-hailing giant ha told some investor that it forthcoming market debut could value it at up to $ 100 billion . It ’ s the first sign from the company about how big it I.P.O . will be .
 Uber told holder of some convertible bond that it stock could be valued at $ 48 to $ 55 a share . That translates into a valuation of about $ 90 billion to $ 100 billion , including the $ 10 billion it plan to raise during the I.P.O .
 That ’ s below the $ 120 billion that banker had predicted last year , prompting some commentator to wonder whether Lyft ’ s struggle in the public market had forced Uber to lower it aim . ( Shares in the smaller ride-hailing company are now down nearly 17 percent from their I.P.O . price . )
 The big question for Uber , along with many of the other tech company going public this year : How long will investor tolerate loss ? Earlier this year , Uber disclosed that it lost $ 842 million in the last three month of 2018 alone . And the company acknowledges it will lose money for a long time , though it plan to show a path to profit .
 We expect to learn more about Uber ’ s I.P.O . later today , when the company plan to publish a prospectus for the stock sale . Its share are expected to begin trading next month .
 More : Uber , Pinterest and other unicorn are reportedly worried about their existing shareholder ’ lock-up agreement , which prevent them from selling for several week after an I.P.O .
 Less than 48 hour before Britain ’ s scheduled departure , the E.U . last night extended the exit deadline until Oct. 31 , Stephen Castle and Steven Erlanger of the NYT write .
 It took nine hour for European leader to agree on the delay . The six-month extension is more than the three month that the British prime minister , Theresa May , had asked for — and that President Emmanuel Macron of France had pushed for — but shorter than the year that some E.U . leader favored .
 The delay give Britain time to get it duck in a row . The European Council president , Donald Tusk , urged the U.K. , “ Please do not waste this time. ” Mrs. May acknowledged that there would be “ huge frustration ” back home over the extension , but said she would again seek to persuade lawmaker to back her deal . The extension could be cut short if she manages to do so .
 But “ the path ahead still resembles a minefield , dotted with explosive issue like a possible attempt to topple Mrs. May , a general election or a second Brexit referendum — or some combination of the three , ” Mr. Castle and Mr. Erlanger write . “ Most immediately , Mrs. May is likely to face call to step down , and potential successor are already trying to raise money and advertise their credential . ”
 Don ’ t rule out another extension . At a news conference last night , Mr. Tusk told journalist , “ Our wish and hope is the U.K. will be ready with a final solution at the end of October — but I ’ m too old to exclude another scenario . ”
 American Media Inc. , which owns the tabloid , said yesterday that the Enquirer is on the block . And a deal could be reached within day , Ed Lee , Andrew and Ben Protess of the NYT report .
 American Media is led by David Pecker , who helped silence a woman who said she had an affair with President Trump by buying her story for $ 150,000 before his 2016 election and never publishing it . Prosecutors who investigated the arrangement gave the company a nonprosecution deal , which requires it to avoid committing crime for the next several year .
 But American Media is in a tough spot over The Enquirer ’ s feud with Jeff Bezos , who say he wa threatened by the publication . Mr. Bezos is expected to meet with federal prosecutor this week to discus his claim . If prosecutor move forward with a case , it could jeopardize American Media ’ s non-prosecution agreement .
 The controversy is spurring the sale . American Media ’ s principal owner is behind the push to sell the tabloid , the NYT report . That company , the hedge fund Chatham Asset Management , “ no longer saw an upside in being associated with The Enquirer. ” An unnamed source told the WaPo that American Media ’ s investor were uncomfortable owning a tabloid involved in supporting Mr. Trump .
 But the publisher say it business focus ha shifted away from tabloid to glossy magazine like Us Weekly and Men ’ s Journal . “ Because of this focus , we feel the future opportunity with the tabloid can be best exploited by a different ownership , ” the company said in a statement .
 The House approved legislation yesterday that seek to revive so-called net neutrality regulation that the Trump administration overturned in 2017 , Cecilia Kang of the NYT writes .
 • “ The legislation would prohibit blocking and throttling web traffic and would categorize broadband a a service open to heavy regulation , ” Ms. Kang writes . The 232-to-190 vote effectively support giving user equal access to content .
 • “ Supporters say the regulation would prevent company from blocking or slowing the delivery of content like video . ”
 • “ Opponents say it would strap broadband provider like Verizon and Comcast with heavy-handed restriction , and could lead to price control . ”
 But the legislation face long odds in the Republican-led Senate . The Senate majority leader , Mitch McConnell , said this week that the legislation would be “ dead on arrival. ” And earlier this week , the Office of Management and Budget “ advised the White House to veto the law if it reached the president ’ s desk , ” Ms. Kang writes .
 And then there were two . The Pentagon said yesterday that only two candidate remained in it contest to win a $ 10 billion contract : Amazon and Microsoft .
 Those were the only company to meet the “ minimum requirement ” for the contract , according to the Defense Department . Only one provider will win the huge contract , which will build the main global data repository for U.S. military service and is known a JEDI .
 The contest had been mired in controversy since Oracle , one of the now-rejected bidder , alleged that an Amazon employee who had worked on JEDI during a stint at the Defense Department had undue influence on the process . A Pentagon spokeswoman said yesterday that the employee had “ no adverse impact on the integrity of the acquisition process . ”
 The P.R . firm Gladstone Place Partners ha hired Christina Stenson , most recently of the Brunswick Group , a a partner in San Francisco .

 Warning : This article contains some spoiler about “ Captain Marvel , ” but no cat pun .

 For a breakout star , it wa a fairly mundane audition . To cast the part of Goose , an orange tabby who play a critical role , the maker of “ Captain Marvel ” were meeting different cat , including Ursula Brauner ’ s Reggie . “ We walked into a roomful of people , and I brought a big plush bed and set it on the table , ” Brauner recalled . “ Reggie hung out on the bed and wa a chill a any cat could be , and the filmmaker saw him embody the character then and there . That ’ s how he got the job . ”
 “ Captain Marvel ” earned more than $ 500 million worldwide in it first week of release , in no small part thanks to Reggie and three fellow feline who steal scene a the stray who is revealed to be a ferocious alien known a a Flerken . ( In the original Marvel comic book , the cat ha the “ Star Wars ” -esque name of Chewie , but the screenwriter changed it to Goose to go along with the movie ’ s “ Top Gun ” motif . )
 Goose , who got his own character poster even before the movie wa released , ha been singled out by reviewer ( “ Best of all there is an orange cat , ” A.O . Scott wrote in The Times ” ) , inspired meme and been the subject of an ode . Kevin Feige , the president of Marvel Studios , even speculated that Goose could star in short on the streaming service being started by Marvel ’ s owner , Disney .
 [ How this movie could solve Marvel Studios ’ woman problem . | Mar-Vell explained . ]
 Although special effect were involved , the actual animal are onscreen a fair amount , but at first it wa going to be just Reggie . “ After looking at the script and seeing the work required , we all decided it would be good to add a couple more cat to the team , ” said Brauner , whose company , Animals for Hollywood , provides and train nonhuman actor for film . In addition to Reggie and another experienced animal actor , Archie ( yes , they ’ re named after Archie Comics character ) , Brauner found two more orange tabby , named Gonzo and Rizzo in a nod to the Muppets , at a shelter .
 Each one had a specialty . “ Reggie wa our all-around go-to cat — he ’ s seen in most of the film , ” Brauner said . “ Archie is really rambunctious and love to play , so we used him for the scratching scene. ” The movie , set in 1995 , depicts the S.H.I.E.L.D . agent Nick Fury ( Samuel L. Jackson ) suffering a cat-related injury , necessitating his signature eye-patch . ( The comic ’ explanation that he lost an eye in World War II didn ’ t jibe with the movie ’ s timeline . )
 “ Gonzo wa mostly for holding in the scene when Goose is carried , ” Brauner continued . “ And Rizzo wa the master of all trade — we trained him in a little bit of everything , so he could step in if we needed backup . ”
 How do you train notoriously finicky cat ? Brauner said the process wa not a tough a you might think . “ Cats can be just a smart , lovable and easy to train a any dog , ” she said . “ It ’ s all positive reinforcement . We use food and treat , and there are different level . We save the real good , hot stuff for when something ’ s a little harder or we ’ re further away from the cat on the set , just to make it worth their while . ”
 Verbal command and clickers were also used . “ When they ’ ve done something right , the sound of the clicker is like an instant ‘ Yes ! ’ ” Brauner explained . “ They look forward to that , because they know a pet or a little piece of chicken or liver is coming . ”
 The cat also eagerly anticipated interacting with their two-legged co-star . “ Sam always gave them treat , ” Brauner said . “ Every time they saw Sam , it wa like , ‘ Oh , I remember you ! ’ ”
 And even though Ben Mendelsohn play an alien who fear Flerkens , he couldn ’ t resist cozying up to the cat either . “ His costume wa a challenge , because he looked so different from a normal person , ” said Brauner , who wa given one of the character ’ s prosthetics-heavy suit to use in training . Once shooting began , “ Ben would always take the opportunity to hang out with the cat and make them feel comfortable , and they really needed that . ”
 What about Brie Larson , who star a the titular superheroine ? “ She ha an allergy , but it never affected u or the cat , ” Brauner said . “ She wa wonderful and always open to helping u , and I really respected her for that . ”
 Even after four month of pre-production training , the cat couldn ’ t perform some action that Flerkens can , like shooting tentacle from their mouth . “ That ’ s when special effect came in , ” Brauner said . “ Sometimes , like in the jet when the G-force is pushing Goose back , that wa computer-generated , but a lot of it wa Reggie , no C.G . needed . The filmmaker did a much a they could just with him . ”
 Brauner said the most difficult part of her job wa “ getting the cat used to working on a chaotic movie set. ” That ’ s also why Reggie didn ’ t actually attend the film ’ s premiere , although separate shot were taken of him wearing a tiny tie on the red carpet : “ We try to make sure we don ’ t bring him out in public where something could go wrong , like a loud noise . ”
 Still , should they be asked to return in any future Marvel movie — or short for a streaming service — Brauner said Reggie and the gang are ready for action . “ I truly don ’ t know if that will happen , ” she said . “ We ’ re always up for that kind of challenge . ”
 Goose ’ s popularity “ surprised u a much a anybody , ” Brauner said . “ But a lot of it is Reggie — his charisma absolutely shine through . ”
 Brauner said fame hadn ’ t changed the cat . “ We try to keep them grounded , ” she joked . “ We ’ re good parent and make sure it doesn ’ t go to their head . ”

 Those who targeted the new superhero film were , in part , incited by comment made by it star , Brie Larson , who called it a “ big feminist movie . ”

 “ This is not a revolution , it ’ s a restoration . Girls have always read comic . ”
 — Kelly Sue DeConnick , the comic book writer whose reimagining of Captain Marvel wa the basis of the new film
 Trolls tried to torpedo the new “ Captain Marvel ” movie — but in the end , the shero Carol Danvers ( who ’ s been Captain Marvel in the comic book since 2012 ) prevailed . The film sailed past $ 500 million in ticket sale in it first week .
 ICYMI : Within hour of the movie ’ s release on March 8 ( International Women ’ s Day ) , in what appeared to be a concerted effort , some 58,000 online review of “ Captain Marvel ” had tanked it rating on Rotten Tomatoes — leaving the film with an abysmal score of around 30 percent .
 Rotten Tomatoes fixed the problem by that afternoon , removing about 50,000 of the review , which the site said had been written before the film wa released . Among other measure , the site swiftly eliminated prerelease audience review altogether .
 “ We ’ re doing it to more accurately and authentically represent the voice of fan , ” the site said , “ while protecting our data and public forum from bad actor . ”
 Now , the movie ’ s audience score is around 62 percent , and the “ Tomatometer , ” which analyzes rating from film critic , is at 79 percent , slightly below the average for Marvel movie .

 But “ Captain Marvel ” is not the only recent female-led film in the comic or sci-fi realm to be swarmed by troll . As my colleague Cara Buckley wrote this week : “ The all-female remake of ‘ Ghostbusters , ’ ‘ Black Panther ’ and ‘ Star Wars : The Last Jedi , ’ which had a diverse cast , all found themselves in the cross hair of armchair critic , some aligned with alt-right group . ”
 Last year , a Facebook group called “ Down with Disney ’ s Treatment of Franchises and Its Fanboys ” posted an event called “ Give Black Panther a Rotten Audience Score on Rotten Tomatoes. ” The group had also claimed responsibility for sinking score for “ Star Wars : The Last Jedi . ”
 Those who appeared to have targeted “ Captain Marvel ” were most likely incited by comment made by Brie Larson , the titular star . Last year , Larson vowed to seek out more underrepresented journalist after noticing she wa being interviewed by mostly white men . She had a similar critique about film critic : “ I do not need a 40-year-old white dude to tell me what didn ’ t work for him about ‘ A Wrinkle in Time. ’ It wasn ’ t made for him . ”
 She also told “ Entertainment Tonight ” that the vision for the film wa clear during an early meeting with Marvel : Make “ a big feminist movie . ”
 Even if the troll tried to stop her , make a big feminist movie she did .

 As the “ Star Wars ” heroine Padmé Amidala and Princess Leia fell in love with Anakin Skywalker and Han Solo , respectively , their outfit grew more skimpy , they grew more helpless , and their focus shifted away from their role a political leader and toward more passive role a romantic partner , according to a new study by researcher at Florida State University .

 I recently read about an elementary school class that wa studying the American Revolution . Each student chose a historical figure to write about . When the teacher asked if anyone had picked a woman , a little girl called out : “ No ! There were no woman then ! ” Even in 2019 this is what many kid think , which is why we still need a month dedicated to the word and deed of female . Knowing the challenge and achievement of all manner of woman history maker , from the big name ( I ’ m looking at you , Amelia Earhart ) to the unsung hero , destroys the false notion that female are mere observer to history . Their story serve a both inspiration and empowerment : If she could , then I can .
 PLANTING STORIES : The Life of Librarian and Storyteller Pura Belpré ( HarperCollins , 40 pp. , $ 17.99 ; age 4 to 8 ) beautifully capture the life and essence of Pura Belpré , the first Puerto Rican librarian in New York City . Arriving in Manhattan with the “ story her abuela taught her , ” Belpré eventually take a job at the library a a bilingual assistant . “ But where are her abuela ’ s story ? Not one folk tale from Puerto Rico is on the shelf . How lucky for the library that Pura ha story seed ready to plant and grow. ” Belpré go on to transform library program through the telling ( and eventual publishing ) of several culturally diverse story .
 Anika Aldamuy Denise ’ s intimate telling capture the magical , folk-tale feeling of Belpré ’ s own story . Her lyrical text , sprinkled like fairy dust with Spanish word , begs to be read aloud , while Paola Escobar ’ s stylishly detailed and warmly expressive illustration capture the joy of sharing story . But this biography , like all good biography , doe not simply chronicle a life . Beneath all the fun is a valuable message . As Denise writes in her author ’ s note , Belpré ’ s life is a “ testament to the power of our own story to build bridge — not just to literacy , but to social change . ”
 Powerful female are not a modern invention . They ’ ve always been with u , chipping away at society ’ s restraint and influencing history . Young reader will discover this when they read about Anna Atkins , the subject of Fiona Robinson ’ s THE BLUEST OF BLUES : Anna Atkins and the First Book of Photographs ( Abrams , 48 pp. , $ 17.99 ; age 6 to 9 ) . Anna is raised by her scientist father , who doe not believe gender should limit accomplishment . Not only doe he provide Anna with an extraordinary education , but he also encourages her to wonder , question and experiment . And so reader watch Anna grow — with each page turn of this elegantly designed book — from a curious child gathering buttercup in an English meadow in 1807 to a learned botanist who collect , record and render exquisite and detailed scientific drawing . “ But when will she get to share her knowledge of the natural world with the scientific community ? ” Robinson writes . On this question hang Anna ’ s greatest achievement . Barred from the Royal Society of London because she is a woman , Anna find a way around the limit imposed by society , eventually publishing the world ’ s first photography book in 1843 .
 Robinson cleverly render her illustration almost exclusively in the cool blue of Anna ’ s cyanotype photograph . This give the book a dreamlike quality ; Anna ’ s world feel misty and faded . In fact , much of what we know about Anna ha been lost to history . In her author ’ s note Robinson admits to creating scene in the first part of the story because of this . This elaboration , of course , make the book historical fiction , rather than biography . But it is Anna ’ s deed that matter here . Her life is one worth knowing . Robinson ’ s book is one worth reading .
 Wilma Mankiller , who died in 2010 , wa the first woman chief of the Cherokee Nation , and a most woman do who rise to elevated leadership role , she scrapped and struggled to get there . In WILMA ’ S WAY HOME : The Life of Wilma Mankiller ( Disney-Hyperion , 48 pp. , $ 17.99 ; age 7 to 10 ) , Doreen Rappaport and Linda Kukuk unfurl Mankiller ’ s evolution from “ dirt poor ” child growing up in a society that devalues Native culture into an exemplar of leadership and strength . It is a detailed account , lovingly rendered in Kukuk ’ s occasionally awkward but enthusiastic artwork , and skillfully told in Rappaport ’ s clear and accessible prose . But it is the use of Mankiller ’ s own word , woven throughout the text , that make this book soar . Hearing her voice give u a sense of the real woman . When Mankiller say , “ Women can help turn the world right side up , ” her sincerity resonates , and we can ’ t help nodding at the wisdom of her word .
 From the first sentence of OUT OF THIS WORLD : The Surreal Art of Leonora Carrington ( Balzer + Bray , 40 pp. , $ 17.99 ; age 4 to 8 ) , written by Michelle Markel and illustrated by Amanda Hall , reader know that the artist Leonora Carrington is a rebel . “ Leonora ’ s parent wanted her to be like every other well-bred English girl , ” Markel writes . “ But she wa not. ” Boarding school and debutante ball could not quash Leonora ’ s artist spirit , and she head to art school , then off to Paris and into the orbit of the Surrealists . But it isn ’ t until she flees to Mexico ahead of the Nazis that Leonora discovers her true artistic voice . Wisely , Hall chooses not to recreate Carrington ’ s art ( which can be brooding and sexually suggestive ) . Instead , she creates bright , busy spread filled with enchantment . Hyenas sport wild , black mane ( much like Leonora ’ s own hair ) . Tortoises peek from pocket . Green potion bubble .
 Markel ’ s telling — evocative and poetic — feel enchanted , too , even if she doe occasionally overstate for effect : “ Leonora and the other female Surrealists … had no interest in painting woman who looked like pretty decoration , a men had done for centuries. ” One could argue that artist from Rembrandt to Goya to Millet depicted woman a they lived and worked , not just a ornament . But the author ’ s point is understood . Carrington ’ s depiction of woman is singular . And Markel ’ s gorgeous description of Carrington ’ s painting is the perfect summation of the extraordinariness found in all female : In them , “ woman have special gift ; they can do thing beyond anybody ’ s wildest dream — which is marvelous , and it ’ s powerful , and it ’ s true . ”
 Candace Fleming ’ s latest Y.A . biography , “ The Rise and Fall of Charles Lindbergh , ” will be published next year .

 Broadway performer and stage manager are demanding a share of the profit from hit show they help to create , setting off a labor dispute that is threatening to disrupt the high-stakes development of new musical and play .
 Actors ’ Equity , a national labor union , and the Broadway League , a trade association representing producer , are at odds over the issue two year after public pressure from the original cast of “ Hamilton ” prompted that blockbuster show ’ s producer to agree to a new formula for distributing it proceeds .
 Equity say the two side are at an impasse and it is considering a limited strike in which it would bar it member from participating in any developmental work with commercial producer . The union say it is unhappy with how it member are compensated for work in developmental lab , which are generally four-week session in which actor and writer test out material for show in progress . Recent production that have used lab include “ The Cher Show , ” “ To Kill a Mockingbird , ” “ Hello , Dolly ! ” and “ Waitress . ”
 “ After two year of wrangling and negotiating we are just at a standstill , ” Mary McColl , the union ’ s executive director , said .
 The Broadway League say there is no impasse ; that the two side are still talking and that producer still hope a deal can be reached .
 “ Negotiations have been going on for some time , with lot of back and forth , and we have additional proposal we ’ re trying to make , ” the League ’ s president , Charlotte St. Martin , said . “ We believe there will be a deal that will be beneficial for both side . ”
 The dispute is intensifying at a time when Broadway is booming . Although most show still fail , those that succeed can make hundred of million and , in a few case , billion of dollar . The current tension come just month before a broader negotiation over the general contract for Broadway performer and stage manager .
 Equity estimate that about a quarter of Broadway ’ s new show in recent year have employed developmental lab to work on script , song and dance . According to the union , the amount of work done in lab ha doubled over the last five season . There have been 75 lab since 2016 , and about half of those have led to full production .
 In recent week “ Lempicka ” and “ Jagged Little Pill ” — new musical that are retooling for Broadway after initial production in Massachusetts — have held such session . And coming up are lab for stage adaptation of the film “ Almost Famous ” and “ August Rush , ” a well a for an untitled Michael Jackson jukebox musical and “ Heart of Rock & Roll , ” which us the Huey Lewis songbook .
 Labs began about a decade ago in an effort to keep more developmental work in New York , which can be more convenient for actor who live in the region but also help to showcase the material . Some lab end with run-through of one or two act , to which potential investor and theater owner are invited a they consider whether to get involved .
 To replace an agreement that ha now lapsed , Equity is asking that the next version include not only a pay raise ( currently lab participant are paid about $ 1,000 a week ) but also a provision requiring that 1 percent of any profit after a show recoups it capitalization cost be shared with lab participant , since they helped to create the show ’ s success . For the last several month , the union ha been making it case via social medium , with some of it best-known member expressing public support for the campaign .
 Stephen Bogardus , an actor who serf a chairman of the union ’ s show development subcommittee , said the landscape had changed , and that pay should change with it .
 “ Everybody want to be in at the ground floor — to create and put their stamp on something , ’ ’ he said . “ We are collaborator , and we need to be acknowledged for what we ’ re doing . We ’ re putting in more skin than we once did , and after recoupment we think it ’ s fair that we should be able to share in the success of the show . ”
 The League ha thus far argued that individual producer should voluntarily decide whether to share profit with lab participant . Some big player already have , including Disney , for “ Frozen ” ; and Lorne Michaels , for “ Mean Girls . ”
 Kate Shindle , the union president , said the amount of money at stake is “ pretty modest. ” Under the union ’ s proposal , for every $ 1 million in profit made by a show , $ 10,000 would be set aside to be shared by the actor and stage manager who participated in the developmental lab .

 Chinatown Fair , which opened on Mott Street in the 1940s , ha survived generation of gaming innovation , new player and rising rent in New York .
 By Alex Williams
 Video arcade — those recreational arena of illuminated screen and 8-bit soundtrack — have been fading from the cultural landscape since the end of the Donkey Kong ’ 80 . The advent of home video game console , hand-held gaming device and smartphones ha all but rendered them relic of a Gen X childhood .
 Yet somehow , Chinatown Fair Family Fun Center life on . The cramped downtown institution is among the last of the city ’ s old-school arcade , often filled with gamers too young to remember Street Fighter IV a decade ago , let alone Missile Command in the Reagan year .
 “ Chinatown Fair should have closed year ago , along with all the other arcade in the city , due to rising rent and the shift to online gaming , ” said Kurt Vincent , who directed “ The Lost Arcade , ” a 2016 documentary about the arcade ’ s enduring legacy in the city . “ But it ’ s still there on Mott Street after all these year because young people need a place to come together . ”
 Say this about Chinatown Fair : It ha been defying the odds for decade . The place opened in the 1940s a an “ amusement arcade ” in an era when Skee-Ball represented the apex of arcade fun . As youth taste changed in the ensuing year , so too did Chinatown Fair . The arcade survived the rise and fall of pinball , the rise and fall of Pac-Man , the rise and fall of Super Nintendo , and perhaps most unimaginably , the rise , and rise some more , of Manhattan real estate price .
 Oddly , Chinatown Fair only found it footing in the 1990s , at a time when arcade around the city ( remember Playland , in Times Square ? ) were dying off a people became increasingly able to game without leaving the house .
 Part of it wa that it wa one of the last arcade standing . Part of it wa that it owner , a big-hearted Pakistani immigrant named Sam Palmer , and his young manager , Henry Cen , began to stock hard-to-find fighting game and keep the door open until 2 or 3 a.m. Part of it may have been it tic-tac-toe-playing live chicken , which became enough of a quirky New York trope to earn cameo in multiple Hollywood movie .
 With revenue dwindling , however , Mr. Palmer wa forced to retire in 2011 . Chinatown Fair seemed doomed . It lay shuttered for more than a year .
 Instead , a new owner , Lonnie Sobel , took over with a mission to bring out the “ family fun ” part of the arcade ’ s full name , luring the birthday party crowd with carnival classic like air hockey , Super Shot basketball and Down the Clown , along with driving game from Japan and the latest shooter game . “ To bring in the family , there ha to be more than fighting arcade game , ” Mr. Sobel said in Mr. Vincent ’ s film .
 What remains is a small business charmingly stuck between two era . The Chinatown Fair of 2019 is not quite a nostalgia palace like New York ’ s Barcade chain , offering craft brew and vintage ’ 80 game like Asteroids to Generation X ironist . Nor is it a Disney-esque mega-arcade like Dave & Buster ’ s in Times Square , serving up strawberry-watermelon margarita and fire-grilled sirloin along with supersized virtual reality game .
 On a chilly Friday afternoon at Chinatown Fair , two girl , maybe 15 and dressed in early-Cure black , squealed in mock-horror a they blasted away at legion of invading alien in a game of Space Invaders Frenzy , a supersized version of the video arcade 1.0 classic .
 Multicolored light flashed in a space a dimly illuminated a a parking garage . The music from rhythm game like Sound Voltex and In the Groove 3 reverberated off brightly painted cinder-block wall . A cluster of giddy teenager huffed and shimmied a their foot tried to keep up with the lighted square on the dance platform of Dance Dance Revolution . It looked and felt like an all-ages version of a 1970s disco .
 Chinatown Fair feel decade removed from the cavernous esports arena taking over empty mall and movie theater , where hundred of gamers huddle in front of oversized monitor playing online game like Fortnite .
 Of course , any gamer would say that their chosen pastime is inherently social . But too many people in too little space is a time-honored New York formula . It is what force u to connect . Which may be one of the reason that this arcade life on .
 “ When you ’ re playing a video game standing next to a person , you are connected through this physical object , ” Mr. Vincent said . “ There ’ s more respect , more sportsmanship , than if you ’ re playing online . You learn from one another , you get heated and angry . It ’ s just so much more visceral . ”
 And , like most form of entertainment , it ’ s an escape .
 “ Would you rather hang out in a small apartment , with your parent in the other room and your mom in the kitchen , or go to the arcade , get some bubble tea , and hang out all night ? ” Mr. Vincent said . “ That ’ s why Chinatown Fair is still here . ”

 At one point in “ Alita : Battle Angel ” — another dystopian fantasy that reminds you of just how visionary the original “ Blade Runner ” wa — the cyborg heroine get a new body . It ’ s a streamlined shoulder-to-foot job , one that make her look like a sex doll with a chrome-plated musculoskeletal system . Her new physique turn out to be an innovative weapon and come with articulated part , a wasp waist and what look like a discreet chastity panel for the groin . It also ha larger breast than the old model , a change that in a snort-out-loud line is pinned on Alita ’ s own idea about how she should look .
 If only someone here were joking or had an idea about the construction of femininity . Why doe Alita ( Rosa Salazar ) , who ha a human brain , even have breast ? Why doe any cyborg that isn ’ t a sex bot or a wet nurse ? Genre convention only partly explains the onscreen look of this character , originally created by Yukito Kishiro in his manga series . Kishiro sex up his cyborg , an amnesiac who in the first comic retains one protuberant breast when the rest of her body is destroyed . This brings to mind Jessica Rabbit , the bodacious femme fatale in “ Who Framed Roger Rabbit ” who purr “ I ’ m just drawn that way ” — yeah , but by whom , for whom and why ?
 “ Alita ” is the latest from James Cameron , though he take only some of the blame . He helped produce the movie and share script credit with Laeta Kalogridis ( they collaborated on “ Avatar ” ) ; he wa going to direct it himself but handed it off to Robert Rodriguez ( “ Sin City ” ) . The presence of other “ Avatar ” veteran — the senior visual effect supervisor , animation supervisor and so on — raised expectation that “ Alita ” would at least look good , different or inspired . But too much of it overall design feel borrowed , by turn evoking the monochromatic clutter of “ District 9 , ” the vertical favelas of “ Ready Player One ” and the randomly milling , anonymous horde of whatever .
 A pileup of clichés in service to technological whiz-bangery , “ Alita ” is one more story of the not quite human brought to life with hubris and bleeding-edge science . It take place in the 23rd century after a global cataclysm called the Fall . The movie ’ s story , inspiration and allusion ( Hitchcock ! ) , though , more rightly announce it a a 20th-century artifact , one that begin when Alita ’ s head and shoulder are found and refurbished by a paternalistic doctor , Ido ( an atypically uneasy Christoph Waltz ) . Theirs is a post-apocalyptic meet-cute that morphs from yet another riff on Frankenstein ’ s monster into a sitcom-y father-and-daughter duet , plus brawling and exposition .
 The story proceeds by fit and start with a narrative line — Alita ’ s journey of self-awareness — that is embellished with a dreary old-fashioned romance and regularly interrupted by chaotic action scene . Some of this crash-boom stuff take place during a game called Motorball , one of those survivalist contest that have been a genre staple since at least the 1975 film “ Death Race 2000. ” The contestant have something to do with Vector ( a wasted Mahershala Ali ) , a regulation villain who take fashion cue from “ The Matrix. ” This being a very small world , he life with Ido ’ s ex , Chiren ( Jennifer Connelly ) , who when not selling her soul lounge in garter and stocking .
 Everything here tends to remind you of something else , including Alita , who wa created with performance capture . This involves monitoring and recording a performer ’ s movement using sensor attached to her face and body , information that becomes the foundation for a character that ’ s digitally fleshed out . Cameron used a version of this technology to greater effect in “ Avatar , ” a reminder that whatever his limitation a a filmmaker — he ’ s a great visual storyteller who ’ s invariably easier on the eye than ear — he is a technological wiz . Salazar ’ s performance , ala , is consistently bland , but then she wa drawn and directed that way , like Jessica Rabbit .
 It ’ s easy to imagine that both Salazar and Rodriguez would have fared better if her face had been left alone rather than rendered into a stylized manga cartoon , complete with a heart shape and eye even bigger than Emma Stone ’ s . It ’ s vaguely diverting to stare at Alita ’ s face , at least at first , to ponder it shape , texture and pale color , and the way that her brow furrow when she ’ s being emphatic . Mostly , though , what ’ s interesting about it is that it lack the conviction , the spark , which turn truly wonderful animated creation — Disney ’ s Pinocchio , Hayao Miyazaki ’ s Ponyo — into character you laugh with and weep for . This is a matter of style , inspiration and imagination , or their absence .
 There ’ s so little at stake in “ Alita : Battle Angel ” that it blur into uninvolving spasm of visual and aural noise a it lurch to the cliffhanger ending , a setup for promised sequel . If you stick around for the end credit , you will read that “ the making and authorized distribution of this film supported over 15,000 job and involved hundred of thousand of work hours. ” In other word , piracy threatens the American movie industry , even if a chunk of the job here seem to have originated outside the United States . It ’ s still a worthy wag of the finger , although it ’ s difficult not to wish that more of those hour had been spent telling a really good story instead of tweaking tech and shiny breast .

 Ryan McCarty let u indulge but make u exercise . Everyone into the pool !
 By Caitlin Lovinger
 SATURDAY PUZZLE — I love those puzzle ( mostly Sundays , I think ) where the theme is a joke that is unfurled over several entry with it punch line at the bottom . We ’ re themeless today , a usual on a Saturday , but the short stack in the middle of the grid made me laugh , if a bit ruefully , a I mentally joined the four entry . Just don ’ t take the last line to heart ! It ’ s not about u , it ’ s some other guy .
 All four of those phrase are debut , by the way ; Ryan McCarty introduces language to the puzzle at a pretty good clip . I thought most of today ’ s puzzle wa fair but fairly tough , smooth and very witty .
 I ’ m modest and slow , so please don ’ t take this a any sort of humblebrag ; it ’ s more of a comment on what I referred to above , the fairness of a particular puzzle . But a I look at my completed grid , I think there ’ s only one entry that I had to resort to research to “ get , ” and it ’ s a short one , referred to in the title of the post . I wa totally stumped by “ orange ball. ” I got FIVE on cross and it didn ’ t occur to me until 3 a.m. , or thereabouts , that Mr. McCarty meant the number on the orange ball in billiards . A memorably devious clue .
 I also really liked the clue for EDIT , BOTANY , RATED R and AROMA . I tend to think of a TASSEL a part of an ear of corn , but technically that ’ s on the stalk too , so it ’ s all good and tricky , and I did not know that the “ Political Victory Fund ” raised money for the NRA .
 17A : The spelling here wa a little confounding : AR TOO DE TOO ( ARTOODETOO ? I wouldn ’ t know how to break this little robot down ) seems like he should have two TWOs in his name , for one , and then an R and a D. But this is established and how he ’ s been clued in the past . It wa super cute of Mr. McCarty to run this nearly next to TOOTIE too .
 55A : This entry wa also a first , and so were the other two in this small stack . It made me smile because UDON NOODLE soup ha sustained me so well this winter — there are ramen spot popping up all over New York right now . I know ramen isn ’ t strictly udon , but you can get all type of noodle in these place , in hot broth with vegetable , and it feel very salubrious in the middle of winter .
 10D : Car culture is funny ; it ’ s very niche when it ’ s happening , but go down in history a integral to the vibe of a whole era . The first thing I think of a typical of 1950s car is their size , those big chubby Chevrolets and Dodges with whitewall tire , fin , bench seat ( it help that I wa recently in Havana and saw dozen of these behemoth chugging through town ) . Nothing specific come to mind today , and the answer , TWO TONE CAR , didn ’ t really either , which go back to my earlier point . There is a growing number of modern model playing with color scheme , including Minis , Nissans , Toyotas and Volvos — it ’ s just not something I ’ ve ever really noticed .
 14D : I liked this entry ; I ’ d only heard of these hard-boiled egg a “ marble eggs. ” They ’ re strangely transfixing when viewed in a pile , a they appear sometimes a street food , but I ’ ve never actually tried them . You can make them at home .
 39D : This is an early week entry when commonly clued a “ Lee Harvey ___ ” or something close to that . I had never heard of Mickey ’ s precursor , although I have seen cartoon featuring OSWALD the Lucky Rabbit — I ’ d just always thought that Mickey ’ s ear had evolved from straight and bunnyish to those little pompoms he ha now , and that we ’ d always been dealing with a mouse . There ’ s an interesting back story to the right to Oswald , which were lost back in the 1920s and then regained in 2006 by the Disney Company .
 I started this one by playing with a number of option at 32-Across and ended up with SCULPTED ABS working out best , and only then after running through a number of more normal option for 33-Down and ending up with the unusual C SCALE . I don ’ t love this answer a a musician because the scale itself is ambiguous ( Major ? Minor ? Mixolydian ? ) , but it helped pull together the middle . I originally had BAYONETTED for 29-Across before finding that it wa more commonly spelled with one T in American English , so I ended up switching to BAYONETING and redoing the NE corner . Unfortunately , there weren ’ t a many stellar fill option here , so I threw in TEA EGG for some interest . I ’ m sure the critic will love it .
 Overall the editing team did a good job tempering my clue , some of which I ’ ll admit were a bit too difficult . I wa sad to see a couple of my favorite clue go , including “ One-man band ? ” for ID BRACELET , and “ Public display of confection ” for DESSERT CASE , but I ’ m glad they kept my unassuming clue for MEN . Hope you enjoy !

 With apology to the People ’ s Front of Judea .

 Opinion Columnist
 “ For generation , Republicans have considered it their duty to make the world safe for banking , while simultaneously prosecuting ever more foreign war . Modern Democrats generally support these goal . There are sign , however , that most people do not… . ”
 — Tucker Carlson , Jan. 3 .
 THE SCENE : News Corp. Headquarters , New York City . Three Fox News host and their producer sit at a conference table in a darkened room , lit by shaft of sunlight coming through narrow vertical window . At the head of the table sit TUCKER , LAURA and SEAN .
 TUCKER : They ’ ve bled u white , the bastard . They ’ ve taken everything we had , and not just from u , from our father , and from our father ’ father .
 SEAN : And from our father ’ father ’ father .
 TUCKER : Yeah .
 SEAN : And from our father ’ father ’ father ’ father .
 TUCKER : All right , Sean , don ’ t labor the point ! And what have the elite ever given u in return ?
 PRODUCER 1 : Financing ?
 TUCKER : What ?
 PRODUCER 1 : Financing . The Murdochs always relied on bank financing to maintain a controlling family stake in their business . And Drexel Burnham Lambert , the junk-bond king , raised the money Rupert needed to buy Fox Television station back in the 1980s . That wa before Rudy Giuliani helped bring Drexel down , though we don ’ t hold that against him anymore .
 TUCKER : Oh , yeah , yeah . They did give u that . Uh , that ’ s true . Yeah .
 PRODUCER 2 : And deregulation .
 TUCKER : Sorry ?
 PRODUCER 2 : The Reagan administration did away with the Fairness Doctrine , which required equal , honest and balanced treatment of opposing point of view . We ’ d have no business model if it were still in place . And the 1996 Telecommunications Act , which Bill Clinton signed , allowed News Corp. to integrate 20th Century Fox , TV Guide and HarperCollins under the same roof , and helped Rupert gain access to 40 percent of American home just a year later .
 TUCKER : Yeah , all right . I ’ ll grant you that financing and deregulation are two thing the elite have done .
 PRODUCER 3 : Tech .
 TUCKER : Well , obviously tech . Goes without saying , doesn ’ t it ? I mean , Sean here wasn ’ t exactly the comp-sci genius of his high-school class , wa he ? But apart from financing , deregulation , and technology . …
 PRODUCER 4 : Global market for our product .
 PRODUCER 5 : Capital market for our retirement account .
 PRODUCER 6 : Stable and predictable legal and regulatory environment .
 TUCKER : Yeah , yeah , all right . Fair enough .
 PRODUCER 7 : Immigrants .
 TUCKER : Immigrants ? !
 PRODUCER 7 : William Lewis , the C.E.O . of Dow Jones , is English . Also Gerry Baker , the former editor of The Wall Street Journal . And Peter Rice , the 21st Century Fox president , now going to Disney . Robert Thomson , the C.E.O . of News Corp. , is from Australia , along with Col Allan , the former editor of The New York Post . Rupert , too , obviously .
 TUCKER : Yeah , well , it ’ s not like they ’ re Hondurans or something . Australians aren ’ t a bunch of criminal .
 Embarrassed silence .
 TUCKER : Anything else they ’ ve done ?
 PRODUCER 1 : Well , there ’ s also Manhattan itself . It ’ s not like any of u would actually want to work in , you know , Dayton or Detroit or any of the neglected corner of America you speak about so touchingly , Tucker . New York ’ s murder rate hit yet another record low last year . And frankly , we prefer eating at Oceana than , you know , the Olive Garden .
 PRODUCER 2 : And education . I mean , most of u here graduated from elite school . You went to St. George ’ s and Trinity College . Laura went to Dartmouth . Let ’ s be honest : Except for Sean , it ’ s not like the people who produce the show at Fox have that much in common , socially or economically speaking , with much of the target audience .
 PRODUCER 3 : America ’ s gross domestic product ha nearly doubled since the end of the Cold War in term of purchasing power parity . And we ’ re close to having the longest economic expansion in history .
 PRODUCER 4 : We ’ ve had three-quarters of a century without a world war , close to half a century since the end of the draft , ultra-low recent casualty figure in Afghanistan and Syria , and a military budget that , a a percentage of G.D.P. , is a fraction of what it wa during the Cold War .
 TUCKER : All right , but apart from capital financing , deregulation , access to global market , a stable and predictable regulatory and legal environment , I.R.A.s and 401 ( k ) ’ s , talented immigrant , global city , good food , university that are the envy of the world , record-making growth and a world in which there ’ s almost no chance of my child being conscripted to fight a war , what else have the elite done for u ?
 PRODUCER 5 : MSNBC ’ s rating beat ours the other week for the first time in 18 year .
 TUCKER : My point !

 The company are adding apps to speed boarding and wearable medallion that serve a passenger IDs , charge card and location beacon .
 By Julie Weed
 Global cruise line are rolling out new technology to help server deliver cocktail to passenger who have wandered off , address traveler by name on ship carrying thousand of passenger and shrink the boarding process to 10 minute from one hour . The company say they are using technology to reduce the most common passenger complaint and make these huge floating vacation city feel more personal .
 Many ship now offer a mobile app to help guest pay for purchase , learn about daily activity , make special request and communicate with other member of their travel party . Some , like Carnival Corporation , Disney Cruise Line , Royal Caribbean Cruises and the Geneva-based cruise company MSC , are beginning to pair them with wearable device that can better track the passenger ’ s exact location on the ship and offer additional convenience . Andy Stuart , brand president of Norwegian Cruise Line , said it introduced a new version of it app for passenger fleetwide January , and will roll out it first wearable device next fall .
 The technology trend coincides with a period of growth in the industry . About 27 million people took a cruise in 2018 , up from 20.5 million in 2013 , according to Monty Mathisen , managing editor of Cruise Industry News . “ We will see some 40 million cruise passenger by 2028 , easily , ” he said . Carnival Corporation , which owns nine line and represents about half of the global cruise industry in number of passenger , ha ordered 20 ship to be delivered by the end of 2025 .
 Passengers see the technology first on the newest and biggest ship , said Mr. Mathisen , although “ the cruise line are busy rolling them back to the rest of their fleet . ”
 The surge is partly thanks to increased computing power on the vessel themselves . Ships now “ have better data center , satellite connectivity and IT staff on board , ” said Manny Vellon , chief technology officer of the software and consulting company , Level 11 , that worked with Carnival to create it wearable OceanMedallion .
 Here are some of the way company hope to address the most common complaint :
 It Takes Too Long to Check In
 Customers have long complained about the check-in process , which can require standing in line for passport presentation , photo-taking and excursion booking . This can stretch sometimes to an hour or more , according to Jay Schneider , senior vice president for digital at Royal Caribbean International , which owns Celebrity Cruises and other line . The goal now is to get passenger “ from car to bar in 10 minute , ” he said . Passengers on all 25 Royal Caribbean and 13 Celebrity Cruises ship can now use a mobile app to scan their passport , take a security selfie and receive a digital boarding pas before they even arrive at the ship .
 I Want to Order a Drink , but Can ’ t Find a Waiter
 A passenger with Carnival ’ s OceanMedallion can order a drink using a mobile app , and the medallion tell the server the person ’ s name and location , even if they have moved , said John Padgett , Carnival ’ s chief experience and innovation officer . The waterproof device act a identification , charge card and location beacon . Two ship in the Princess Cruises fleet , which is owned by Carnival , offer the medallion and three more will offer it in 2019 .
 I Feel Anonymous on This Big Ship
 Wearables can allow crew member using a mobile device to view the name of the person approaching them so they can greet the passenger by name . That ’ s a level of service expected on the most expensive cruise , “ but we can make that available to all passenger , ” Mr. Padgett said .
 They Aren ’ t Playing Our Song
 Passengers wearing an OceanMedallion carry the information they ’ ve chosen to share with the cruise line wherever they go . “ When our guitarist see that people from Colorado are in her audience and she play John Denver music , it ’ s like magic happening , ” Mr. Padgett said .
 This Bar Is Too Crowded
 Using a heat map to see where guest are congregating and how many crew member are there can help determine staffing level , said David DeCurtis , chief executive of the DeCurtis Corporation , which creates customer-experience software for cruise ship , mall , airport and hospital . If there ’ s a crowd at one bar and another is empty , staff can be shifted .
 What Happens in an Emergency ?
 The ability to track passenger is critical during an emergency , Mr. DeCurtis said . During an evacuation , the crew can use location software to see who is heading to assembly station ; who are still in their room ; which passenger have special need and might need help ; and whether child are with or without their parent .
 I Just Want Everything to Be Easy
 The newest onboard apps encompass the passenger experience from planning the trip through commemorating it . That could include booking dining and excursion , swiping through the day ’ s itinerary and dining menu , or receiving a personalized book of photo at the end of the voyage . Some cruise company , like Holland America Line , offer kiosk on board with many of the same function .
 The new technology also help the bottom line , Mr. Vellon said . When passenger plan their journey before leaving , they sign up to do more on the ship , he said , and because many future cruise are booked by passenger on current one , improving service would also drive sale .

 You know thing are going wrong with the Oscars when even Lin-Manuel Miranda get upset .
 The “ Hamilton ” star , who ha long cultivated a reputation a Twitter ’ s crown prince of positivity , reached his breaking point last week after it wa reported that the Oscar broadcast would run only two performance from the five nominated song .
 Most Oscar producer would regard this year ’ s best-song lineup a a rare gift , since many of the tune hail from box office behemoth and can be sung by big star . Still , on the telecast , the academy ha reportedly chosen to feature only “ Shallow ” from “ A Star Is Born ” and “ All the Stars ” from “ Black Panther . ”
 [ Here ’ s the complete Oscar ballot . ]
 Among those left in the cold are Jennifer Hudson , a consistent awards-show powerhouse who would have sung “ I ’ ll Fight ” from the documentary “ RBG , ” and Emily Blunt , the popular star of two of last year ’ s biggest hit , who could have performed “ The Place Where Lost Things Go ” from “ Mary Poppins Returns. ” The notion of excluding these artist from the broadcast didn ’ t sit well with Miranda , Blunt ’ s “ Mary Poppins Returns ” co-star .
 Miranda wa referring to another recent Oscar controversy , the decision to soldier on with no host for the show after Kevin Hart stepped down over offensive tweet , but the truth is that Oscar conflagration are happening on a regular basis these day , and many are of the academy ’ s own making .
 Take another decision , tweeted by the Variety reporter Kris Tapley on Sunday , to award the winner of the best-cinematography Oscar during a commercial break . The academy is exploring this option for several of the tech category to cut the length of this year ’ s show , and while those acceptance speech will probably be edited into the broadcast later that night in some kind of truncated form , reporter at the ceremony will be announcing the winner on social medium long before the home audience get to see them .
 Blowback to this idea wa fierce and immediate , with many blasting the academy president , John Bailey , who is himself a cinematographer . “ I ’ m offended by the proposed change to the telecast , ” tweeted the director and academy member Gina Prince-Bythewood ( “ Beyond the Lights ” ) . “ Filmmaking is a collection of craft and The Academy is the only award show that honor and amplifies all . As it should be . ”
 It should be , but will it ? At this point , the Oscars seem almost ashamed to put on a show . There will be no host nor overarching comic sensibility , most of the musical performance have apparently been cut ( including the nominated “ Ballad of Buster Scruggs ” song “ When a Cowboy Trades His Spurs for Wings ” ) , and plenty of worthy category will be shunted to the margin . Given the mandate by ABC to trim the length of the telecast , we can expect acceptance speech to be ever more quickly curtailed , and I ’ ll be surprised if we still see clip of the nominated performance , the sort of thing that might introduce some of these smaller movie to a wider audience .
 In other word , the Oscar telecast ha become an entertainment program determined to divest itself of all entertainment .
 Does the academy understand why we still tune into this show ? When I think back on the Oscars of yesteryear , I remember moment , not minute : a speech that surprise , a musical performance that connects , an unplanned line that becomes a part of history . If the academy isn ’ t going to leave room for those moment to happen , it might a well issue a press release instead of a broadcast .
 The Oscars ought to take a few cue from the Super Bowl , another mammoth entertainment event that refuse to be ashamed of it size . When the Super Bowl is broadcast this Sunday , producer won ’ t be forced to choose between either the national anthem or the halftime show , or eliminate overtime if the game go long . They understand that people want the Super Bowl to be a maximal a possible , a communal watching experience that give u plenty to talk about . Why can ’ t the Oscars be a unabashed ?
 Even the Super Bowl ’ s most annoying feature — endless commercial interruption — ha been rebranded a one of it greatest strength : You now watch not just to see which team prevails , but to debate what high-profile ad won the night , too . Instead of apologizing for the Oscars ’ length , ABC could take similar advantage of it by stuffing the commercial break with exclusive footage from “ Avengers : Endgame ” or “ Toy Story 4 , ” two film to be released by the network ’ s fellow Disney subsidiary Marvel and Pixar .
 There are plenty of other organic , exciting way to work those blockbuster into the broadcast , and they can even help restore some of the category the academy want to cut from the show . Is a sound-mixing Oscar the most scintillating thing to present during the telecast ? On it own , perhaps not , but what if you could show a clip of Beyoncé and Donald Glover mixing their duet of “ Can You Feel the Love Tonight ” from the forthcoming redo of “ The Lion King ” ? The presentation might take a little longer , but I doubt anyone would complain .
 So let ’ s embrace that attitude : Instead of apologizing for the show ’ s length , the academy should resolve to pack the Oscar broadcast full of major moment , no matter how long it go . Instead of antagonizing the craftspeople who should be celebrating the biggest night of their career , the Oscars should find a way to honor them by making every presentation a blockbuster event .
 As a kid , Lin-Manuel Miranda tuned in to the Oscars simply because he loved a movie , and there wa no show on earth that loved movie more . It ’ s time for the Oscars to prove they can still be that show .

 OUTSIDE LOOKING IN By T.C . Boyle
 As a kid growing up in southwestern Virginia , I lived down the street from a cloistered visionary named Greg , an older boy who read book and spoke in zealous declaration .
 One day of summer vacation when I wa 9 , Greg declared that we would build a monorail . This wa an era of global oil shock and nuclear meltdown , and Greg wa of the fervent belief that the monorail might save u all . It ’ s true that monorail at this point did not figure prominently into the rural imagination , and certainly not mine . But I knew there wa one at Disney World and so I wa , for a time , all in .
 For his project Greg assembled a small team ( me ) and he selected a location — his half-acre backyard , where he once led me on a brief tour . Mostly , though , he sat inside , making sketch and declaration . There were , a I recall , a lot of sketch . I sat with him in his kitchen , dream adjacent .
 As it turned out , we never even broke ground . After two day , I grew weary of watching Greg sketch . Our intentional community , once so cohesively bound by purpose , splintered because I really wanted to leave Greg ’ s kitchen . Greg abandoned the project , no doubt realizing that it ’ s not easy to become a difficult genius . And it ’ s too bad — had Greg been more fiendishly charismatic and capable , had he attracted a few more acolyte , had he maniacally pursued his salvific vision of backyard mass transit , he might very well have grown up to become the subject of a T. Coraghessan Boyle novel .
 With a soft spot for the crackpot , Boyle ha , over many year and novel , made hay with American iconoclast and ideologue , myopic seer who strive against the current of convention . We are an experimental nation — a nation of spectacular hypothesis and failure — and Boyle ha been drawn repeatedly to doomed scheme and community ( the biosphere , the hippie commune , the wellness cure , etc. ) . He writes with a youthful and sustained energy that parallel the zeal of his dreamer , and that ultimately attenuates their failure . There are few writer who seem more American .
 Boyle ha constructed novel in tight orbit around Alfred Kinsey ( “ The Inner Circle ” ) , Frank Lloyd Wright ( “ The Women ” ) and John Harvey Kellogg ( “ The Road to Wellville ” ) . Now , in “ Outside Looking In , ” his 17th novel in 37 year , Boyle ’ s subject is , surprisingly , the acid evangelist and counterculture icon Timothy Leary . The surprise is not that Boyle turned to Leary ; the surprise is that it took him this long to do it . Brilliant , obsessive , defiant , narcissistic , messianic and ambitious , Leary is for Boyle a low-hanging fanatic .
 Though President Nixon allegedly called him “ the most dangerous man in America , ” Leary today is rather le notorious . Readers of a certain age may not know that Leary wa , in the early 1960s , a clinical psychologist at Harvard , where he touted the mind-expansive quality of psychedelic drug ; that a part of the Harvard Psilocybin Project he administered psychedelic drug to prisoner and divinity student ; that he encouraged his student to use drug , and he used with them ; that LSD wa legal at this time ; or that Harvard fired Leary in 1963 for , among other thing , “ fail [ ing ] to keep his classroom appointment . ”
 After a prelude about Albert Hofmann ’ s synthesis of LSD in Switzerland in 1943 , Boyle ’ s account cover the year 1962-64 , a period in which Leary and retinue — grad student , minor celebrity , independently wealthy dilettante and a monkey — retreat from authority in order to establish a community around LSD , or “ the sacrament. ” From Leary ’ s wrecked rental house in Cambridge , the “ psychonauts ” move to a beach hotel in Mexico and then finally to a 64-room mansion in Millbrook , N.Y. Their “ session ” constitute groundbreaking research into human consciousness , not unlike the important work done by collegian during Spring Break Daytona .
 [ How doe a writer put a drug trip into word ? ]
 Most of the novel resides in the perspective of Fitzhugh Loney , one of Leary ’ s graduate student . ( The middle third , roughly , shift to the perspective of Fitz ’ s wife , Joanie . ) After mild initial reluctance , Fitz and Joanie , young parent to a teenage son named Corey , eagerly cast off the burden of conventional life to join Leary ’ s coterie . ( Boyle is our great dramatist of the inner circle . ) Fitz is ostensibly a researcher , but in a neat turn Boyle position him a a subject of Leary ’ s grand experiment .
 Though there are trouble and omen , Fitz and Joanie remain committed and enthusiastic tripper throughout the move to idyllic Mexico and then to rural Millbrook . Gradually , however , the experimental life becomes a slog . This novel is not , it must be said , full of surprise . As it turn out , constant drug use and free love may not be good for your marriage , family or academic career . If you ’ ve studied history — or if you ’ ve read other Boyle novel — you know well the arc of utopia .
 The mansion in Millbrook , regarded by it inhabitant a a “ spaceship ” or “ planet , ” is a setting perfectly suited for Boyle ’ s method . It ’ s the kind of microcosmic , nested world — dome , estate , island , sanitarium , commune — that he ha utilized in previous novel . And in “ Outside Looking In ” there is yet another crucible inside the crucible — the human mind , rearranged by LSD . During one of Fitz ’ s trip , “ world collided , glacier calved , civilization marched across the landscape erecting temple and tearing them down and starting all over again. ” Meanwhile , Joanie on LSD feel “ the texture of the carpet beneath her a if it were the portal to the center of the earth and she wa dropping down the molten side of it over and over again . ”
 This kind of travel writing is a challenge . It ’ s not easy to evoke the spiritual or therapeutic dimension of a psychedelic drug , and ultimately the novel is not quite persuasive about the allure or potential of LSD a transformative ego suppressant . Michael Pollan ’ s recent book testifies to the salubrious power of LSD , and I wa prepared to have my mind expanded by a fictional account of Leary and crew . But the drug use of Boyle ’ s psychonauts seems , almost immediately , decadent and dull . The trip are amazing , but they don ’ t lead anywhere . Fitz and Joanie begin in the spirit of exploration , but that give way quickly to the spirit of escape , an endless and thoughtless party . They seem a doomed by counterculture a by culture . This is probably the point — “ more and more , they seemed to be going outward rather than inward , ” Fitz realizes late in the novel — but the inward journey never seems that vital or convincing . LSD doe not radically alter Fitz ’ s sober perspective , at least not in an appealing way . Consequently , the novel ’ s trajectory is not pronounced , and the inevitable dissolution of the community is le compelling .
 Stylistically , Boyle ha always moved down the page in a skier ’ s crouch . He is a spirited downhill writer , capable of creating energy by virtue of his own pace and verve , and that is certainly the case here . This is not the best T. C. Boyle novel , but it ’ s without question a T. C. Boyle novel — kinetic , conceptual and keen . Moreover , when you take a step back from the book you can begin to appreciate that Boyle — much in the spirit of his quixotic and ambitious subject — ha now completed his own impressive public art project : a Mount Rushmore of American Fanatics .
 Chris Bachelder ’ s latest novel is “ The Throwback Special . ”

 LOS ANGELES — The ever-evolving Los Angeles County Museum of Art ha cleared it biggest hurdle to erecting a radical new building by the Swiss architect Peter Zumthor that represents one of the country ’ s most ambitious museum transformation .
 The county board of supervisor voted Tuesday to approve the current plan and release $ 117.5 million in taxpayer funding for it , despite last-minute entreaty from some art and architecture critic who urged the board to vote against the project .
 Michael Govan , the museum ’ s director , in turn , took to the Opinion page of The Los Angeles Times to present his case .
 “ This is the big green light everybody ha been waiting for , ” Mr. Govan said after the meeting , where leader of neighboring museum and celebrity like Brad Pitt and Diane Keaton made short public comment of support . “ Now we can go ahead with construction drawing and go raise the rest of the fund with the assurance this is going forward . ”
 In the week running up to the vote , the $ 650 million project , which is mainly privately funded , received it sharpest criticism yet . The independent architecture critic Joseph Giovannini and The Los Angeles Times art critic Christopher Knight both described problem with the Zumthor design — a sweeping , one-level structure perched on pavilion that will replace four ailing structure .
 They both referred to the county ’ s final environmental impact report , issued last month , which noted that the proposed building offer only 110,000 square foot for gallery — le space than previous design — and 10,000 fewer square foot of gallery space than in the building slated for demolition . ( Mr. Giovannini , who said that he had hired an architect to analyze the original building , put the loss of gallery space at 53,000 square foot . )
 Both critic also wrote that they feared the architecture would undermine the purpose of an encyclopedic museum like Lacma by integrating different collection — from Mesopotamian antiquity to contemporary art — in uniform gallery . ( Mr. Govan recently decided to merge American art and European painting and sculpture , two major department , upsetting the critic . )
 In one column , Mr. Knight called the project “ the incredible shrinking museum , ” noting that he “ couldn ’ t name another art museum anywhere that ha ever raised hundred of million of dollar to spend on reducing it collection space . ”
 Including the county ’ s contribution of $ 117.5 million , the museum ha raised $ 560 million . The county plan to issue a $ 300 million bond to loan money to Lacma , which Mr. Govan explained would cover expense until the pledge come in . ( The museum also receives about 25 percent of it operating cost from the county . )
 Mr. Giovannini wrote that the museum would be assuming an “ unprecedented and unconscionable ” amount of debt . In his fourth article on the subject in the Los Angeles Review of Books , he note that Lacma already carry $ 343 million in debt .
 Addressing the question of how much debt is too much , Mr. Govan cited the institution ’ s “ A3 stable rating by Moody ’ s . ”
 “ All big , ambitious architectural project are controversial , ” Mr. Govan said in an interview . “ But the county ha done it due diligence . This project ha already been through the fire of scrutiny by so many expert and consultant . ”
 Responding to complaint about the future of permanent collection gallery , Mr. Govan confirmed that the Zumthor plan doe not include “ purpose-built collection gallery ” designed to showcase object from a particular culture or period but rather seek to create space that are “ good for different kind of art. ” Then , he said , “ we can move the art a needed over time a our collection and need change. ” He called the decision a philosophical a well a a practical one : “ The category museum and university use for art are not sacred ; they are convenience and need re-evaluation all the time . ”
 On the issue of shrinking square footage , he countered that he ha expanded gallery space significantly with the addition of two exhibition hall designed by Renzo Piano ( the Broad Contemporary Art Museum , known a BCAM , and the Resnick Pavilion ) that were built on the campus during his tenure . He also cited recent measurement his staff made of the original four building that found the new plan decrease gallery space by only 4,000 square foot .
 Nicolas Berggruen , a museum trustee , who is also building a research group known a the Berggruen Institute near the Getty Center , said focusing on square footage — which shifted over time , in part because of environmental concern — missed the point .
 “ The truth is , something a bit bigger might be better , but it would be a shame not to go ahead with the building , ” he said . “ Stopping this project would be bad for the museum and bad for the civic fabric of L.A. ; it would show that L.A. can ’ t get it act together in term of it cultural future . ”
 One reason the stake are so high is that Los Angeles ha historically been home to few great example of public architecture . Many of it most important innovation have been residential , including home by Frank Lloyd Wright , Rudolph M. Schindler and Richard Neutra . Frank Gehry ’ s Disney Hall , a widely celebrated building that give Angelenos an image of their own city beyond the Hollywood sign , took over a decade to complete and almost wasn ’ t built for lack of funding . And Rem Koolhaas ’ s proposal to overhaul the Lacma campus , which won a 2001 design competition , failed because of funding challenge .
 Diana Thater , an artist who ha exhibited at the museum , said the Zumthor building , which bridge Wilshire Boulevard , could become a major tourist destination . “ I want L.A. to have this building , ” she said . “ The city need a beautiful , memorable museum that people will flock to visit , ” she added , praising the design for potentially unifying the campus , creating a more expansive , parklike setting and establishing “ a horizontality where art from different culture can be considered simultaneously . ”
 These day , when she brings her student from ArtCenter College of Design to visit , she said : “ I ’ m always apologizing for the condition of thing . I ’ m sorry it ’ s not beautiful like Bilbao or the Met . I ’ m sorry the ceiling are cracking . ”
 Even opponent of the plan agree that the four building slated for demolition , three of which were designed by William Pereira in the 1960s , need to be replaced .
 Mr. Zumthor , a Pritzker-winning architect , earns accolade for the restrained quality of his building and his sensitivity to material . But some say that his strength could be a weakness at such a large scale and that he ha not built in the United States before .
 The architect ha not spoken out much about the project , leaving Mr. Govan to play the advocacy role . “ He make extremely beautiful building , ” the museum director said . “ People say that he doesn ’ t know American building system , but actually he doe . And Skidmore Owings & Merrill , who we ’ ve hired a the project architect , really know them . ”
 Demolition of the old building is set for early 2020 , with the opening of the new building planned for 2024 .
 Because of incorrect information supplied by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art , an earlier version of this article misstated the institution ’ s rating with Moody ’ s Investors Service . It is A3 , not A2 .

 ZAO ONSEN , Japan — Ashley Huang had seen the picture on the internet , and they were mesmerizing : huge , Godzilla-like creature , naturally formed by snow and ice , encasing conifer tree spread across a mountainous landscape in northern Japan .
 Last month , she and a friend , Yi-Hsien Lin , traveled from Taiwan to Zao Onsen , a village in Yamagata Prefecture , to view the snowy formation up close .
 I met them in line for the ropeway that would take u one mile up to the peak of Mount Zao , a skiing outpost that ha increasingly drawn tourist from around Asia to see the “ juhyo , ” known in English a ice or snow monster .
 Trouble wa , when we arrived at the top after a 30-minute ride on two separate cable car , the cold wa biting , but the view disappointing .

 Many of the icy figure seemed to be diminished version of the photograph online . Instead of majestic beast , there were spindly tree draped in clump of snow .
 “ I wa expecting to see more , ” Ms. Huang said , after retreating to a cafe inside the ropeway station . “ I think it just look like ice on a tree . I don ’ t know why they call them ice monster . ”
 In the immediate term , rain and an unseasonable warm spell a few day earlier were responsible for the droopy snow creature . But in the longer term , scientist say climate change is coming for the juhyo .
 Researchers have tracked a steady deterioration of the snow monster — both in the acreage they cover and the length of the season in which they can be seen — because of warming temperature that melt the snow earlier and at higher elevation .
 The tree are also being ravaged by moth that gobble up their needle and a specie of bark beetle that have been killing otherwise healthy tree in the last five year .
 Typically , the juhyo materialize under precise condition .
 Cold , dry westerly wind blow down from Siberia , across the Sea of Japan , and form bank of cloud that drop supercooled water that ice over the conifer found in the northeast of Japan .
 When snow fall and thickens over that icy mixture , the tree are transformed into an army of abominable snowman .
 Dating back to the early 20th century , scientist identified juhyo stretching from a far north a Hokkaido , Japan ’ s northernmost island , to a far south a Nagano , which wa host to the 1998 Winter Olympics and is about 150 mile northwest of Tokyo .
 Today , Yamagata Prefecture , about 230 mile north of Tokyo , is the farthest south the juhyo can be found .
 Fumitaka Yanagisawa , a professor of geochemistry who study the juhyo at Yamagata University , said average temperature in Yamagata between December and March have risen by about 2 degree Celsius — or 3.6 Fahrenheit — since 1910 .
 “ I am very worried about greenhouse effect , ” Dr. Yanagisawa said . “ By the end of the century , the juhyo will disappear from earth . ”
 In an effort to replenish the tree that have died , the local forestry service ha tried planting seed close to the top of the mountain for the last three year . Until last spring , when official covered the seed with wire mesh , rodent got to them before they were able to sprout .
 Akiyoshi Nishikawa , the director of the Yamagata District Forest Office , said the service would also try transplanting young sapling from lower elevation to the mountain peak .
 The village host a smattering of lodge , hotel and hot spring bathhouse for visitor from Taiwan , Thailand , the Philippines and Singapore who started flocking here about five year ago to see the snow monster , made famous by photo sharing on social medium site like Instagram .
 But increasingly , local tourism official are worried that tourist will leave disappointed .
 “ In the past it wa mostly skier , but recently there are a lot of people who have come just to see the juhyo , ” said Hideo Shimanuki , the director of the Zao Ropeway . “ If the juhyo disappear , it will be a big minus for our business . ”
 About 77,000 visitor took the ropeway last winter season , up from 47,000 three year earlier .
 “ I came to ski and see the ice monster , ” said Darius Tan , 39 , an academic tutor from Singapore who wa resting in the ropeway cafe . “ They were on my bucket list . ”
 The sparsely covered tree , he said , were “ not really what I wa looking for . ”
 On good day , the snow-covered tree still look gorgeous , but at the Zao Onsen Tourism Association , where poster adorn the wall showing juhyo in their wide-girthed glory , Hachiemon Ito , a local hotel owner and chairman of the association , acknowledged that what we had seen on the mountain were scraggly edition .
 “ What you see today , we would not describe a juhyo in the past , ” Mr. Ito said . “ In the past they used to be so much more beautiful . ”
 He said the town hoped to survive on tourist attracted to the hot spring bath , known a onsen , and local cuisine , a well a visitor from country that do not get much snow .
 In a sign of some climate change consciousness , the hotel where we stayed had turned on just one space heater in each room , leaving a sign on the other noting that because of global warming , the owner were trying to conserve energy .
 We got a glimpse of the magic of the juhyo when we took a nighttime trip up the ropeway . As the cable car silently ascended over perfectly snow-dappled tree , it felt at first a if we were taking a Disney ride through a landscape of computer-generated image .
 But a we rode higher , I could see some lumpy creature looming up on the side of the mountain , lit by the headlamp of a large bulldozer escorting tourist on a close-up excursion .
 Despite our disappointment earlier in the day , here were the juhyo we had come to see : a zaftig queen in a long white gown with a crown of tree-branch antler , and another in the shape of a Tyrannosaurus rex .
 Earlier in the day , we had met a retired couple from Saitama , a Tokyo suburb , who had come for a two-day trip to see the juhyo .
 Keiko Kawanishi , 71 , wanted her husband , Kazuhiro , 74 , to see what she remembered from a trip to Zao Onsen 60 year ago .
 “ I skied from the summit to the bottom of the mountain , ” she recalled . “ And all the way down , the juhyo were so thick . ”
 I could only imagine it .

 Will a film studio ’ s New York set help a contemporary art fair soar after the city ’ s other fair flopped ?

 LOS ANGELES — The New York backlot of Paramount Studios , where fake brownstone and townhouses mimic city street , ha been invaded by alien before . But it ha never seen anything quite like the bright green serpent that wind all the way from a “ SoHo subway station ” up through several apartment window .
 The snake isn ’ t scary — but ha alarmingly low production value , being handmade out of papier-mâché and studded with colorful aquarium pebble . And the artist behind it , Trulee Hall , ha underscored the unsophisticated nature of her beast in an accompanying claymation video , complete with that horror-movie trope of a screaming woman in a bathtub .
 “ I love the fakeness of it all , ” Ms. Hall said cheerfully this week on the SoHo set , where Paramount worker on a cherry picker were securing the creature , which she called “ phallic and umbilical , ” to the fire escape of a cast-iron building . “ The entire Paramount lot is beautifully fake in a really safe way , like an adult Disney World . ”
 Now it ’ s about to become an amusement park of another sort — for art collector .
 Ms. Hall ’ s work is one of 16 artist project commissioned for the debut edition of Frieze Los Angeles , taking place at Paramount from Feb. 15 to 17 . A group of art fair started by the publisher of an art magazine in 2003 in London , Frieze ha long been known for it curated project a well a it customized gallery tent . The L.A. edition ha both , with a tent behind the artist project designed by the architect Kulapat Yantrasast , of the firm wHY , that will house 70 gallery , from homegrown L.A. success story like Regen Projects and David Kordansky to international powerhouse like Hauser & Wirth and Pace . ( Still , this iteration is le than half the size of Frieze ’ s London or New York edition . )
 The hope is that the novelty of this setting will help the fair succeed where others have failed . In 2011 , the organizer of New York ’ s Armory Show held an L.A. fair downtown ; it survived only two year . A spinoff of Paris Photo , also at Paramount , lasted three . But Frieze Los Angeles ha already generated more momentum than those event , with five smaller fair piggybacking on it and more than three dozen museum-affiliated collector group flying into town .
 Victoria Siddall , director of Frieze Fairs , think the timing is finally right . “ It ’ s similar to the situation in London when Frieze launched there , ” she said . “ L.A . ha all the ingredient that make it a city you want to visit : museum , gallery , artist living here , art school . The only thing missing wa one moment when everyone wanted to come . ”
 Her colleague at the talent agency Endeavor , an investor in Frieze , suggested the Paramount location . “ It wa because of the location that I couldn ’ t say no , ” said Ali Subotnick , a former Hammer Museum curator who ha organized the 16 new artist project . “ I loved the idea of working out in the real world , out of the white cube , out of the white tent , though of course this ha an extra layer because it is a fake world within the real world . ”
 Just around the corner from Ms. Hall ’ s serpent , Cayetano Ferrer ha installed on an exterior brick wall an assemblage of neon sign bought from a Burbank prop shop . He superimposed “ Sin Club ” on “ Legal Charity ” and “ Adult Movies ” on “ Kids Games. ” Together the signage form a head-like shape that nod to Freud ’ s classic diagram of the human psyche . “ I ’ m using the language of this prop city to make a concrete poem , ” he offered .
 His sculpture had been moved last minute to a more protected location because of forecast of rain . But otherwise Ms. Subotnick didn ’ t sound worried . “ The artist knew to make their work weatherproof and waterproof , ” she said . “ And the interior of the brownstone stay dry . ”
 Sarah Cain ’ s installation could seem cozy even on a bleak day . She ha taken over the shallow interior of a New York-style brownstone , painting door , floor and even a sofa where visitor can sit , a well a hanging canvas and installing a stained glass artwork in the window . She worked with andSons Chocolatiers of Beverly Hills to create an Earl Grey-infused , vegan dark chocolate that she plan to serve throughout the preview period on Thursday , the preview day , and offer around teatime after that .
 Nearby , Lisa Anne Auerbach is also making a participatory work , creating “ Psychic Art Advisor ” a a shop in a brownstone marked by a neon sign in the window where those word flash in different combination . She ha brought in the performer Estela Sanchez , also known a Alpine Moon , to serve a the spiritual-aesthetic guide .
 “ I wa thinking about the overlap between psychic and art adviser , ” Ms. Auerbach said , sitting in an Eames office chair that wa meant to signal the moneyed art-world presence and holding tarot card she made for the occasion . “ The shop are often run by woman , ” she explained . “ They are often sole proprietorship , and they may be unlicensed or unaccredited — they can just put a shingle out. ” She added , “ We ’ re hoping people come in with question about collecting , curating and creativity . ”
 Kori Newkirk ’ s work “ Signal ” also touch on cosmic communication . He ha planted on city sidewalk two spiky sculpture , each made of old-school television antenna bunched together at the end of a pole . Looking like robotic hand , the obsolete technology now seems futuristic . “ I wa born analog , but I will die digital and my experience is of both , ” the 48-year-old artist said .
 As the antenna of one sculpture swayed close to a window during installation , Mr. Newkirk told a grip , “ We can definitely bend them to get that thing snug. ” A few minute later he said in a stage whisper : “ I actually wouldn ’ t mind breaking a window . It would give more fake-real authenticity to this fake-real place . ”

 President Trump may have set off a trade war with China . But , so far , it isn ’ t hurting one key industry in his hometown .
 The number of Chinese visitor to New York City continued it steady rise last year , according to the latest tourism statistic .
 The city ’ s tourism-marketing agency planned to announce on Wednesday that the number of visitor to the city rose to a record high of 65.2 million in 2018 , the ninth straight annual increase . Most of the gain came from visitor from the United States , but the number of tourist from China rose slightly to 1.1 million , up from 1.04 million , despite worry that the trade battle would curb travel between the two country .
 “ From what we see so far , we feel like business with China will remain strong , ” said Fred Dixon , the chief executive of NYC & Company , the tourism agency .
 China is the second-leading source of foreign tourist to the city , ahead of Canada ( 1 million ) , and it is not far behind Britain ( 1.24 million ) , according to the agency ’ s data .
 “ We embrace diversity and are welcoming to all , ” Mayor Bill de Blasio said . “ And the more than 65 million visitor to our city were able to experience that firsthand . ”
 Mr. Dixon said the total number of visitor rose by 2.4 million , or about 3.8 percent , last year . And he said he expected another increase in 2019 , to at least 67 million visitor , driven in part by the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising and the WorldPride celebration planned for late June , which is expected to attract a surge of visitor .
 [ New York City is No . 31 on The Times ’ s 52 Places to Go in 2019 List ]
 He said he also expected a boost from a new marketing partnership the agency ha entered into with Mastercard , which is replacing American Express a the preferred payment system of NYC & Company . Mr. Dixon said it wa the biggest corporate partnership the agency had ever had .
 Mastercard is paying an undisclosed sponsorship fee to the agency , whose budget this year is about $ 39 million . The city provides $ 21 million annually to the agency .
 Cheryl Guerin , an executive vice president of Mastercard , said the company would use it marketing campaign to promote special offer in the city , such a dinner cooked by celebrated chef like Marcus Samuelsson in iconic spot like Carnegie Hall or the baseball diamond in Yankee Stadium . The company ’ s two billion cardholder also will get early access to annual event in the city , including Restaurant Week and Broadway Week , she said .
 “ We do have other tourism partnership with other city but this will be one of the biggest one , ” Ms. Guerin said .
 Mr. Dixon said he expected the arrangement to help drive “ more and more visitation to the winter period , ” when travel to the city is the slowest . He said NYC & Company would promote the first few month of the year a “ the optimal time to come to New York for value . ”
 Mastercard publishes an annual list of the city that are most popular with tourist ; New York is currently ranked sixth , behind Bangkok , London , Paris , Dubai and Singapore . Among American city , New York rank second only to Orlando in the number of visitor it draw . Orlando claim to attract more than 70 million visitor a year .
 But Mr. Dixon said those are primarily domestic visitor who do not spend a much a foreign tourist — though anyone who ha taken a family to Disney World lately might beg to differ . Foreign visitor typically spend about four time a much a domestic visitor , he said .
 Overall , tourist spent about $ 44 billion in the city last year , NYC & Company estimated . The agency extrapolates it tourist count from tally taken at popular attraction like the Empire State Building and from airport traffic and hotel occupancy data . NYC & Company count anyone who stay overnight or travel from more than 50 mile away a a visitor .
 Last year , the city ’ s hotel sold 37.7 million overnight stay , the most ever , the agency said . Those stay generated more than $ 620 million in tax for the city , it said .
 A hotel-building boom ha been going on in the city for several year . There now are 119,000 room in the city , with nearly 20,000 planned or under construction , said Chris Heywood , a spokesman for NYC & Company .
 The long , steady surge in tourism trace back more than a decade to a decision by Michael Bloomberg , the former mayor , to spend more money to promote the city . In 2007 , when the city wa drawing about 44 million visitor a year , he set the seemingly audacious goal of raising that number to 50 million by 2015 .
 After city official took control of NYC & Company from the hotel and restaurant industry and increased it budget , tourism grew even faster than Mr. Bloomberg had imagined . If Mr. Dixon ’ s forecast prof accurate , the number of tourist this year will be 50 percent higher than in 2007 .

 Broadway is booming , and now more actor are going to share in the rich .
 In a groundbreaking agreement Friday , the commercial producer who finance Broadway ’ s big hit have agreed to give a percentage of profit to performer who help develop successful show .
 The deal , reached between Actors ’ Equity , a union representing 51,000 performer and stage manager , and the Broadway League , a trade organization for producer , is a milestone , marking the first time that the industry ’ s financier have tacitly agreed to acknowledge that performer are contributing idea , not just labor , to shaping new musical and play .
 Hit show already generate payday for producer , director and star ; many of them now will bring steady if modest paycheck to the supporting actor and dancer , some of whom still take survival job , like waiting table , between show .
 “ Creating a new show is hard , ” said Mary McColl , the union ’ s executive director . “ If we ’ re along for that ride at the beginning , for not much money , we think we should be able to share in the success once it ha recouped it expense . ”
 The deal brings to an end a five-week strike in which the union barred it member from participating in work on major show in commercial development .
 Equity said the agreement would split 1 percent of a Broadway show ’ s profit among actor and stage manager who took part in development with it producer . The profit-sharing will last for 10 year and will include money generated by touring production .
 The union said the agreement also includes a salary increase for actor and stage manager participating in show development .
 The president of the Broadway League , Charlotte St. Martin , offered a restrained endorsement of the agreement , saying producer were “ pleased we ’ re going to get back to work . ”
 She took issue with Equity ’ s description of the deal a profit-sharing . But she acknowledged the significance of the agreement , saying , “ This is a new way of doing business . ”
 [ What ’ s new onstage and off : Sign up for our Theater Update newsletter . ]
 Broadway show , especially musical , take year to create , often through such developmental step a lab , workshop and staged reading . Many hit have been incubated in these lab , but until now , the actor and stage manager have been guaranteed only a weekly salary .
 The long-simmering issue came to a head with “ Hamilton , ” a it became clear that the show would become staggeringly profitable , and actor involved in it development grew unhappy that they would not share in the profit .
 After those actor hired a lawyer in 2016 and became more vocal about their concern , the show ’ s producer agreed to a profit-sharing deal , but the visibility and perceived injustice of their dispute prompted a broader conversation among actor about how they are treated financially when a show hit the jackpot .
 Some producer — notably Disney , for “ Frozen , ” and Lorne Michaels , for “ Mean Girls ” — volunteered to share profit a well . But the labor union sought a promise that all producer would do so when the contract governing actor participation in developmental lab came up for negotiation last year .
 Neither “ Frozen ” nor “ Mean Girls ” ha yet become profitable , but both production have been selling well thus far . Kyle Selig , who play a teen heartthrob in “ Mean Girls , ” said the money would allow him to focus on performing full-time .
 “ I ’ m a younger actor , and my first five or six gig were all developmental work , ” he explained . “ We ’ re being asked to do more and more and more , and nothing wa changing payment-wise . ”
 Privately some producer have argued that actor are compensated for their work on lab — about $ 1,000 a week , a fee that ha not changed in more than a decade — while it is investor who take financial risk , and the creative team that truly shape story .
 But actor have pointed to a practice in television and other part of the entertainment industry — the payment of residual for work on show and commercial — a a precedent for compensating performer for work that lead to long-term success .
 According to the union , one in four Broadway show now put together a developmental lab on the way to opening . There have been 75 developmental lab since 2016 , about half of which led to a production , the union said .
 Last month , a lack of progress on the issue prompted Equity member to strike . The strike — which did not interfere with show already running — wa the first such job action taken by Equity in nearly 50 year .
 Equity unanimously approved the new agreement Friday , and gave the go-ahead for development work to start up again immediately .
 The two project that stand to benefit soonest are the jukebox musical “ Don ’ t Stop ‘ Til You Get Enough , ” about Michael Jackson , and “ The Heart of Rock & Roll , ” using the music of Huey Lewis and the News . Each had been planning a lab this winter .
 Matt Doyle , who led a production of the Huey Lewis musical at the Old Globe in San Diego and will do the same in a New York lab later this month , said he wa delighted by the agreement , both because he want to get back to work and because he appreciates that actor are getting their due .
 Mr. Doyle , who ha done many staged reading and developmental lab over the year , pointed out that when actor are hired to replace cast member in a show , they are often asked to follow the outline of the original performance .
 “ Our creative input matter , ” he said . “ There is a lot in creating a role that is not just saying the line that have been given to you , but bringing yourself into that role . ”
 The agreement come at a time when Broadway is bringing in more money than ever — during 2018 , Broadway show were seen by 14.37 million people and grossed $ 1.825 billion . Although most show still fail financially , a few ( “ The Lion King ” and “ Wicked , ” for example ) have grossed billion of dollar by staging multiple production over many year .
 Stars of Broadway show — especially those with demonstrable fan base from film or pop music career — occasionally negotiate their own deal that include weekly salary of ten of thousand of dollar and even a percentage of the box office . Most performer — dancer and other ensemble member — are paid the Broadway minimum , about $ 2,000 a week .

 A Trenton Charlson Sunday puzzle , you say ? Charlie Oscar Oscar Lima !
 By Caitlin Lovinger
 SUNDAY PUZZLE — Trenton Charlson is a recent but steady contributor to the Times puzzle ; this is his Sunday debut and his 10th offering in a little le than two year ( not counting a really inventive variety puzzle ) . He still need a Tuesday to hit for the cycle , but that will happen .
 The theme today revealed itself ( appropriately ) slowly to me . It ha to do with something that I find fascinating , though , and manifest itself through a really , really cool double trick by Mr. Charlson . So I spent about a long researching the topic a I spent working on the grid , and found all of that time well spent .
 There weren ’ t a lot of debut outside the theme answer today , but the fill wa still tight and bright . I had a few mix-up , like “ Amin ” for ADAM and “ REO ” for GEO , but found almost all of the name familiar — ETHAN , JAKARTA , GOYA , OLAV , TATI , ADELE — ANYA wa about the only one that wa new a clued..
 I really loved the clue for SLED ( which glide on runner that never get tired ) , URSA , ITALY , SPUD and especially NIAGARA — I needed almost every crossing letter to make sense of that entry and it made me laugh .
 82A : We ’ ve all had this image in mind , right ? Anyone who solves TILTS AT a windmill every so often . I always imagine Don Quixote at an angle , but “ tilt ” refers more to speed and precision , or lack thereof . EPEES and SHEATH in this puzzle were nice touch .
 120A : I know my coat tree and my hat rack ; it seems that HAT TREES are some sort of amalgam , vertical storage for a display of multiple hat .
 17D : Everyone who ha a stock ( one that can ’ t be POACHED , that is ) enjoys a “ dividend ” when it come . In this case , it doesn ’ t fit — you have to settle for an UPTREND , which is probably better in the end , what with compound interest , if you ’ re thinking long term .
 41D : For something romantic , a I think this entry suggests , it sure doesn ’ t get much love from the slang in question . “ Traps ” are usually being told to shut , not demonstrate affection a KISSERS do .
 54D : I knew “ mañana ” mean “ tomorrow ” in Spanish , so I checked my mental inventory for “ today ” en Español , natch , for “ Mañana preceder. ” De nada , we ’ re just looking for the beginning of a common phrase , “ hasta mañana , ” or “ see you tomorrow . ”
 I don ’ t know why my thought went here , exactly , but I wa reminded of the ABBA song .
 57D : This entry seemed a little too crosswordese for me , TOP LINE , short for “ top of the line , ” I guess — but it ’ s been in the puzzle plenty of time . Its 1959 debut clue wa “ Where the star 's name go , ” which I like .
 As I solved this puzzle I really peppered this grid pretty evenly , so the theme revealed itself slowly . There are six theme clue at 22 , 33 , 47 , 67 , 85 and 100 Across , question also denoted by asterisk , a well a a two-part revealer at 114A and 115A . The trick is pretty specific , and the cipher-minded among u probably picked up on it right quick . I did not .
 Before I finished any of the theme answer completely I had bit and piece everywhere — WORLD , BOSTON , PHONE , PRINCESS and so on . The first entry I completely filled in wa 85A : “ *Exclamation after a performance of ‘ Every Breath You Take ’ ? ” I recognized the band behind the song , the Police , so the answer a I filled it in on the cross made sense : BRAVO , STING .
 Fine . Moving on , to 100A : “ *Amusement park named after a ‘ Peanuts ’ boy ? ” I had gotten the second part , WORLD , rather easily , and thought of Disney World , of course , or the “ It ’ s a Small World ” ride . Gradually , CHARLIE filled in for the first part , but CHARLIE WORLD did nothing for me .
 I even had THE PRINCESS AND — on the big span entry at 67A , “ *Duo ruling a kingdom on Take Your Daughter to Work Day ? ” . But it wasn ’ t until I figured out 22A , “ *Ballroom dancing event for Beantown resident ? ” that my poor brain broke the code , and I got the theme .
 Let ’ s look at the answer here , BOSTON TANGO PARTY . We know that we want “ Tea ” here , not TANGO . But TANGO rang a bell — it ’ s possibly an individual thing , but I instantly recognized this word a T in military jargon , although my knowledge really ended there . So we have “ Tea , ” phonetically represented a “ T , ” represented a TANGO , a if we ’ re at war , perhaps with Trenton Charlson .
 Let ’ s look back at what we ’ ve already solved : Now BRAVO , STING becomes “ B ” STING , or “ bee sting. ” CHARLIE WORLD becomes “ C ” WORLD or “ Sea World. ” And I ’ m reminded of a couple more letter from this military alphabet .
 Unfortunately , my knowledge of this alphabet wa too limited to lean on for much more help , but I muddled through the other three , helped by the pun in the clue ( that span ? THE PRINCESS AND THE PAPA , of course — PAPA = P = “ Pea ” ) .
 So the “ New York baseball team ” is YANKEE , or Y , or “ why , ” a in YANKEE BOTHER — and the “ winner get the loser ’ s pant and jersey ” in a UNIFORM , or U , or “ you ” in UNIFORM BET .
 If you solved the revealer early , down at 114 and 115A , it probably made a difference . I got the second part at the very end — I got NATO at 114A , but had PHONE to start the next entry and didn ’ t think of PHONETIC at all . In fact , I wa focused on those “ enigma ” machine that inspired a movie a few year back , remembering scene with these switchboard-like setup with headset . The device referred to here is semiotic — the NATO PHONETIC ALPHABET . It ’ s also designed to ensure clear communication , not succeed in obfuscation .
 As a constructor , I never know what will spark the idea for a puzzle ; the only consistent factor seems to be the rewarding feeling of having that breakthrough that make a puzzle possible . Here , the tiniest seed of an idea wa planted while I wa pre-editing clue for a themeless . I wa trying to think of an interesting clue for DELTA , then suddenly realized that it is a letter in both the Greek and NATO alphabet . This connection must have lying dormant in my brain , waiting for it next big moment , because seeing the clue again some time later immediately gave me the idea of replacing individual letter in phrase with letter of the NATO alphabet . This seemed a if it might have potential , but I had difficulty coming up with theme answer . I reflected that using homophone for letter instead might allow for better themers , and then eventually realized I had inadvertently found the perfect way to tie my theme together — by replacing word of a “ phonetic ” alphabet of sort with the letter of an actual phonetic alphabet ! And just like that , I had the theme for my first published Sunday puzzle . TOO EASY , right ?
 The title I proposed wa “ Forming an Alliance , ” but I think the new title , “ Code Switching , ” work remarkably well . I also had originally clued NATO and PHONETIC ALPHABET separately to explain what is replacing/replaced in the theme answer , but the new clue simplifies thing . My revealers did seem a bit convoluted , and hopefully it will be enjoyable for solver to piece together the inner working of the theme without a much assistance . After all , epiphany should be not just for constructor , but for solver too !
 It wa interesting to have the opportunity to incorporate so much seven- and eight-letter bonus fill into a themed puzzle — enough to fill a themeless ! — and I ’ m proud of how it turned out . I wa pleased to work in entry like BEAR PIT , JAKARTA , JUJITSU , OOH LA LA , PROSPERO and SISYPHUS , and I think the puzzle is pretty clean over all . I also like a lot of the clue of mine that survived — my favorite here are those for 19-Across , 33-Across , 67-Across , 120-Across , 88-Down , 99-Down and 107-Down , along with the clue echo of 15- through 17-Down .
 It ’ s exciting to be making my Sunday debut today , and hopefully it will be the first of many . Until next time , happy solving !

 Whenever a class war break out online , order is suspended , and instinct set in . As the detail of a college-admissions bribery scandal reached the public ( dozen of wealthy family accused of buying fake grade , fake test score and fake athletic achievement ) , the first impulse wa to shame the parent ; but the second wa to go after their kid . People wanted to see how all those fraudulent academic investment were paying off . They wanted to look the brat in the eye , to maul their social medium feed and kick around the scrap . Which led straight to the YouTube channel of Olivia Jade .
 Olivia Jade Giannulli is the 19-year-old daughter of the actress Lori Loughlin ( from “ Full House ” ) and the clothing designer Mossimo Giannulli ( the Target guy ) . According to a complaint filed by federal prosecutor , Olivia Jade ’ s parent styled her a the coxswain of a crew team , staged an action shot of her working an ergometer and paid off a University of Southern California senior associate athletic director to summon an offer of admission .
 In real life , Olivia Jade is devoted to a different extracurricular activity : beauty influencing . Critics seized on a video she uploaded last year , slicing out a 14-second clip to set loose on Twitter . In it , Olivia Jade sits on the floor of a bedroom with the sparse aesthetic of an Airbnb , her hair in an artfully messy bun , a wishbone pendant nestled against her tanned chest . Her young face is contoured and highlighted to cartoonish perfection , like the human version of some adorable Disney forest creature . She read a fan ’ s question about college plan from her phone . “ I don ’ t know how much of school I ’ m going to attend , but I ’ m going to go in and talk to my dean and everyone and hope that I can try and balance it all , ” she responds . “ I do want the experience of game day , partying . ... ” She pause , searching for a third reason to enroll in a university . Instead she blink and say , “ I don ’ t really care about school , a you guy all know . ”
 This clip is not a flattering discovery for someone whose family ha just been accused of rigging her admission , and outsider took it a reassurance that Olivia Jade really wa the vapid waste of education they already assumed her to be . But part of the appeal of the teenage YouTuber is that she is not , like a traditional role model , required to admonish her viewer to stay in school . She is meant to feel a if she could be one of them , and so she is free to voice noncontroversial disaffected-teen sentiment , such a : School suck . When Olivia Jade say that she doesn ’ t care about school , her video cut and zoom in on her face — YouTube ’ s standard visual grammar for emphasizing an arch joke , equal part self-deprecating and self-satisfied .
 This is a young woman who know that academic are not her strong suit . But she is clearly skilled at her after-school job , and it ’ s far more practical than coxswaining : Soon after filming the clip , she leveraged her online following into a branded makeup palette at Sephora . In the wake of the scandal , detractor have dug up many of her anti-academic tweet ( “ It ’ s so hard to try in school when you don ’ t care about anything you ’ re learning ” ) . But threaded between them ha been plenty of enthusiasm and commitment for her job : “ Excited to film tomorrow & get back to workkkk work work work . ”
 I can ’ t know what discussion the Giannulli family may have had about Olivia Jade ’ s future , but honestly : How important is it for a person like her to attend a fancy university , other than to satisfy her elder ? “ Mostly my parent wanted me to go because both of them didn ’ t go to college , ” she told another YouTuber . You sense , in some of the story to emerge from these fraud charge , an odd form of intergenerational class conflict , in which wealthy people who did not grow up pampered ( Loughlin is the child of a telephone-company foreman ) are now trying to impose middle-class value ( a good education is important ) on superrich kid who see little use for them . When The New York Post approached the Fifth Avenue home of a beverage magnate charged in the scandal , a son emerged to defend his parent while smoking an enormous blunt and plugging his rap album . Many kid compete for elite college slot in an attempt to gain access to a higher social class , but some of these parent are surely seeking the opposite effect — a degree that suggests their kid are not simply coasting on their inheritance while cultivating vanity career . They are heaping money on their progeny in an attempt to correct for how rich they are .
 If an elite school is a branding exercise , that brand is perhaps more valuable to rich parent than to rich kid . An underperforming , school-averse teenager is often content to attend a low-pressure state school with good party ; it ’ s his parent who are desperate to prevent this . More than faking their kid ’ athletic or test-taking prowess , these parent have faked their own parenting . They did not wind up raising enviable , academically extraordinary child , but they ’ ve fudged the result so they can drop “ U.S.C. ” in conversation instead of “ A.S.U. ” Some went to comical length to hide these intervention from their child , while others , including Olivia ’ s parent , supposedly involved the kid , letting them know the exact distance between what they were getting and what they deserved . When these parent celebrated their success , you might imagine they were reacting not with pride but with relief : They had managed to prevent their kid from messing up the path they had planned for them .
 They had also helped convince the rest of u that their kid really were successful . We still like to picture our higher-education system a the linchpin of a meritocracy , like a public utility that sort the accomplished from the rest . We instinctively conflate elite schooling with worth . The idea of unqualified kid getting into Stanford or Georgetown may rankle u , but this scandal should also call into question the outsize reputation of such school . They exist partly through a bargain in which wealthy elite commingle with the highest-achieving student of the lower and middle class . The wealthy launder their privilege by allowing select others to earn their way into it orbit . And the intelligence and success of hardworking peer make a wealthy wastrel seem qualified by association : Maybe he graduated with straight C ’ s , a drinking problem and an unearned job at the family business , but he went to Yale — isn ’ t that where smart people go ?
 Right before the video clip that wa isolated for optimum Twitter shaming , Olivia Jade say something else revealing : She is worried that other kid at school are going to take advantage of her . “ That ’ s already my big fear of meeting people at my college — that they are just going to use me , ” she say . She seems to see the value of a good education , in exactly the way so many parent see it : a a transaction .

 It speaks to the general high quality of the Metropolitan Opera these day that performance like this week ’ s “ Aida ” are rare .
 Yes , in the 21st century there may be fewer deliriously great night at the opera than there once were . ( Though try to get a ticket to the Met ’ s “ Adriana Lecouvreur , ” if you want a taste of what those were like . )
 But if the high have winnowed , so have the low . You ’ re far le likely than you were even 15 or 20 year ago to be embarrassed by the company — to face what opera fanatic call , with fascinated disdain , filth .
 The befuddled cast thrown together for the season ’ s umpteenth “ La Bohème. ” The routinier conductor . The creaky set . These all used to be far too common , but the Met under Peter Gelb , it general manager since 2006 , chug along with more professionalism . We can argue about staging and singer , but the operation overall is solid .
 Sometimes , though , you get a whiff of the bad old day , like a sudden glimpse of the seedy , pre-Disney Times Square . That wa the perverse glory of the “ Aida ” on Monday . Returning for four performance after a starry run in the fall — followed by three more , with a new cast , later in the winter — the show stumbled from start to finish .
 Summoning a quartet of great Verdi singer — soprano , mezzo-soprano , tenor and baritone — isn ’ t easy , but there ’ s no reason a major opera house should go 0 for 4 . The tenor Yonghoon Lee fared best of the central foursome a Radamès , but apart from a loud , tightly ringing high register , his sound lost energy lower down and tended to thin into a croon at anything softer than a scream . Roberto Frontali ’ s voice lacked focus a it delved into Amonasro ’ s baritonal depth .
 The mezzo Dolora Zajick , who ha been singing Amneris at the Met for 30 year , is , at 66 , a wonder of longevity . But her once-mighty volume ha faded , other than an occasional forced burst of blunt power , leaving only her stolid , vaguely querulous portrayal of this complex character .
 Making her Met debut a Aida , a role she ’ s sung around the world , the soprano Kristin Lewis lacked vocal fullness and color ; her performance gave the impression of a faint pencil sketch of the part . ( Sondra Radvanovsky wa originally scheduled , but canceled on Christmas Eve . ) The bass Soloman Howard , a the King , wa the only one onstage with a dependably steady , clear , penetrating sound . This muted ensemble wa presided over with brisk facelessness by the conductor Nicola Luisotti , who gave little sense of the majestic atmosphere that should fill the work ’ s civic scene , nor of the urgency of the personal drama .
 It wa a vexed evening all around . Ms. Lewis seemed to be nearly crushed by a lowering set before “ Ritorna vincitor. ” The amplification of the offstage priest in the Judgment Scene wa distorted , resulting in weird sibilant blaring from above the proscenium . Even one of the horse in the Triumphal Scene bridled hard , all too ready to bolt the stage .
 Indeed , the only real highlight of the performance wa a single note : Ms. Lewis ended that Triumphal Scene with a high E flat , an octave above what Verdi wrote .
 This flashy interpolation didn ’ t really exist in opera lover ’ imagination before Maria Callas wa captured doing it in pirated , widely circulated live recording from Mexico City in the early 1950s . Since then , some Aidas have added the note , but it remains unusual enough that I hadn ’ t heard it in person until Monday ; for that , I thank Ms. Lewis , even if her clean , brief E flat wa far from a resonant , Callas-style spear .
 I recognize that sometimes repertory staple deep in the season return to the stage with precious little rehearsal . But with some in the audience paying hundred of dollar for ticket , there ’ s no excuse for something like this . And besides , Bizet ’ s “ Carmen ” came back for nine performance on Wednesday — like “ Aida , ” after a run in the fall — in considerably better shape .
 Not that everything went smoothly for “ Carmen , ” either . The turntable that rotates the Act I set of Richard Eyre ’ s production wa broken , so it needed to be essentially restaged on the fly . Under the baton of Louis Langrée , the child ’ s chorus got painfully away from the orchestra near the beginning , and balance were sometimes off : At the end of “ Les tringles de sistres tintaient , ” in Act II , you could barely hear the melody .
 But thing settled down — and the turntable functioned at it next appearance , at the very end of the opera . Don José ha been one of the tenor Roberto Alagna ’ s best Met role , and he sounded youthfully inflamed on Wednesday , stronger than when he opened the company ’ s season with a painfully unsteady performance of “ Samson et Dalila ” in September . ( He , too , settled down later in that run . )
 Mr. Alagna ’ s onstage presence ha become more subdued than it used to be : I wanted more obvious unraveling , more physical heat from this “ Carmen , ” a I did from his paternal turn in “ Cavalleria Rusticana ” and “ Pagliacci ” a year ago . But by the end of “ Carmen , ” his quiet ferocity — a homicidal explosion of what we ’ d now call toxic masculinity — wa chilling .
 Aleksandra Kurzak ’ s soprano vibrates with feeling a Micaëla ; Alexander Vinogradov is a sturdy Escamillo . Anchoring the performance wa the mezzo Clémentine Margaine , arrestingly stern and articulate in the title role . Her voice doesn ’ t bloom , but it darkly insinuates , like a clarinet . And she portrays a disconcertingly changeable , mordant yet ( seemingly genuinely ) hopeful Carmen , rising to stony grandeur in the final duet .
 She put vocal prowess at the service of a creative , personal conception of the character : If only there wa any of that in the Met ’ s woeful “ Aida . ”
 AidaCarmenAida continues , with this cast , through Jan. 18 ( and return Feb. 28 ) ; Carmen continues through Feb. 8 at the Metropolitan Opera , Manhattan ; 212-362-6000 , metopera.org .

 Law Roach , the man behind the look of Instagram ’ s biggest celebrity a well a Zendaya and Tiffany Haddish , us clothes to send a message .
 By Claire Coghlan
 When Ariana Grande stepped on stage at the Times Union Center in Albany for the start of her 80-date Sweetener World Tour this week and began to belt “ God Is a Woman , ” she did so wearing a mix of haute and street wear , Versace and the independent Los Angeles designer Oscar Utierrè , that signaled the next stage in her professional evolution from Nickelodeon star to global sensation .
 Her longtime stylist Law Roach said the point wa that she can no longer be put in any single box .
 Neither , a it happens , can he . A thoughtful 30-something ( he is evasive about his age ) who ha been helping Ms. Grande define and refine her image since 2015 , Mr. Roach ha in the process become something of a lightning rod and activist in an industry that ha struggled with issue of size-ism , racism and # MeToo .
 “ I like to grow with my client , ” he said by phone on a break from tour rehearsal in Pennsylvania . Ms. Grande , he said , “ went through so much these last two year : the bombing at the concert , the death of what could have been one of the love of her life , the breakup with Pete . ”
 Mr. Roach wa referring to the singer ’ s former fiancé , Pete Davidson ; her late boyfriend , Mac Miller ; and the suicide bombing that killed 22 people in Manchester , England , during her 2017 Dangerous Woman Tour . “ It ’ s just , she ha 148 million people on Instagram alone watching her go through it , ” he said .
 In helping Ms. Grande make the leap from teenage kitten to adult woman-with-a-cause , Mr. Roach is staying true to a career marked by evolution : Celine Dion emerging from grief to become a viral sensation in an $ 885 Vetements “ Titanic ” hoodie during Paris couture week in 2016 ; Tiffany Haddish famously re-wearing Alexander McQueen for the third time to present at the MTV Movie & TV Awards in 2018 .
 Most recently it wa Zendaya ’ s masterminding of her Tommy Hilfiger x Zendaya collection during Paris Fashion Week . The show wa inspired by the Battle of Versailles , the 1973 face-off between French and American designer that featured a large number of black model , many more than usual runway show .
 “ It wa about paying homage to the people who opened the door for u , ” Mr. Roach said , of the Zendaya show . All of the model were woman of color , and included Pat Cleveland , who walked in the Battle of Versailles ; Veronica Webb , the first black woman to land a cosmetic contract with a major brand ( Revlon ) ; and Beverly Johnson , the first black woman to appear on the cover of American Vogue . Ten of the 59 woman , aged from 18 to 70 , were plus size .
 Black plus size woman ? “ In our community , that ’ s a given , ” Mr. Roach said . “ This is the shape of woman we ’ ve grown up with — my mom , her aunt , her grandma . It had to be size inclusive , because if the woman in Zendaya ’ s family can ’ t wear it , then she doesn ’ t want to make it . ”
 “ We all know the average woman is not a size 0 or 2 , ” Mr. Roach said . “ I think it ’ s just human nature to want to see ourselves , to be represented . When I got into this industry , I didn ’ t see anyone who looked like me . ”
 Mr. Roach wa the first black stylist on the cover of the Hollywood Reporter ’ s annual Stylist & Stars issue , in 2017 . “ I ’ m still the first to do some thing in 2019 , ” he said . “ The more I ’ ve been around , the more I see where the deficit is .
 “ It ’ s award season , I ’ m taking high jewelry appointment , I see who else is at those appointment . When I go to Paris , I see who ’ s at the show . During the Oscars , I ’ m backstage with Mary , and I see what that landscape look like , ” he said of last year ’ s ceremony , where Mary J. Blige , a client , wa nominated for best supporting actress and best original song , for “ Mudbound. ” “ Why is this still the landscape ? Why doe it still look this way ? I just always come back to the question : Is it talent or is it opportunity ?
 “ You get to this position by first being someone ’ s intern , ” Mr. Roach said . “ And then an assistant . I don ’ t see black assistant , or black intern . Everybody ’ s not going to meet a Zendaya and have the gumption or the ability to figure everything out . ”
 Mr. Roach grew up on the South Side of Chicago , the oldest of five sibling , with a single mother . “ I grew up very , very , very , very poor , ” he said . “ Single parent , shelter . I wa a kid of the street . ”
 Far from thinking about fashion , he wa thinking about how to feed his sibling . “ I wa always big brother/mother because my mother suffered from alcoholism and drug addiction , ” he said . “ I had to cook . I had to clean . I raised my youngest brother when my mom passed away . I grew up with nothing . Literally , nothing . ”
 While working a a bartender , he and his best friend opened a vintage clothing store called Deliciously Vintage . One day in 2009 , Kanye West walked in , and Mr. Roach wa soon fielding inquiry from around the world .
 “ People started calling the store , ‘ Hey , I ’ m a stylist for this magazine , do you have . ... ’ It triggered something in me , ” said Mr. Roach , who started calling himself a stylist . Now he call himself an “ image architect , ” because , he said “ I didn ’ t have someone else ’ s formula of how to do this job , I created my own . ”
 Two year later , one of his customer , a close friend of Zendaya ’ s father , invited him to Los Angeles . Zendaya , then a budding Disney star , wa going to Justin Bieber ’ s “ Never Say Never ” premiere . “ They were going to the mall to find something to wear , and my friend Chastity wa like , ‘ Oh , you should take Law . He love clothes , he can help , ’ ” Mr. Roach said . “ So , we all went to the mall . And Zendaya and I have been together ever since . ”
 Now Mr. Roach is gearing up to help Zendaya with the press tour for “ Spider-Man Far From Home ” with Tom Holland , a well a starring in the Bloomingdale ’ s 2019 spring “ Mix Masters ” campaign , a himself . He is also eyeing a creative endeavor , whether it is taking the helm of an existing brand or starting his own .
 Mr. Roach belief people must demand change , and at all level . “ This next generation of girl in Hollywood — the Zendayas , the Yara Shahidis , the Kiki Laynes — these woman are coming in asking to work with people who look like them , ” he said . “ That ’ s the only way this landscape is going to change . We have to be able to be in these room . ”
 An earlier version of this article misidentified the event for which the stylist Law Roach worked with the actress Tiffany Haddish . It wa the MTV Movie & TV Awards in 2018 , not the Academy Awards .

 On Fourth of July weekend in 2015 , while Hillary Clinton campaigned in New Hampshire for the Democratic presidential nomination , theatergoer in Falmouth , Mass. , got a look at a work in progress about her — Lucas Hnath ’ s play “ Hillary and Clinton , ” now poised for Broadway .
 Set in an alternate universe during the 2008 primary , a she fight for survival against a charismatic upstart , it wa a comic tragedy , and it couldn ’ t have been more topical . Unfolding around a pivotal moment in the contest , it examined how the stricture of her gender and the baggage of her marriage affected her ability to navigate the men ’ s world of politics .
 Hal Brooks , the artistic director of the Cape Cod Theater Project , remembers his audience loving the series of staged reading . But he wa so sure of the real Mrs. Clinton ’ s odds in 2016 that when he thought about the future of this play , rooted a it wa in a failed White House run , he did have a concern .
 “ Once she ’ s president , ” he said , “ will anybody really be interested ? ”
 Needless worry , that . Bad news for Mrs. Clinton seems to have been a stroke of luck for the play . So , apparently , ha the uprising of feminist outrage that followed her defeat , propelling a wave of woman into Congress this year and a pack of female candidate into the 2020 presidential race .
 Starring Laurie Metcalf a Hillary and John Lithgow a Bill , and directed by Joe Mantello , “ Hillary and Clinton ” arrives at the Golden Theater in March amid a raucous cultural debate about gender politics and the double standard that woman face .
 Not a bad outcome , but a surprising one for a play that wa written in 2008 and had to wait eight year for it world premiere — until Mrs. Clinton wa once again waging a primary campaign . Directed by Chay Yew , it opened at Victory Gardens Theater in Chicago in April 2016 .
 Charles Isherwood , writing about that production in The New York Times , said that “ Hillary ” found Mr. Hnath ( pronounced nayth ) in “ unusually cautious ” form . But Chris Jones , in The Chicago Tribune , called the play “ audacious , whip-smart , highly entertaining ” and “ an important piece of writing . ”
 It ’ s a play that ponders how publicly tough Hillary ha to be , how tender she can afford to be and whether it ’ s possible to strike a balance that won ’ t risk condemnation .
 In the gap of year before he staged it , Mr. Yew said , the script “ kind of bounced around to some theater , and nobody knew what to do with it . ”
 “ Also one wondered at the time , for some theater , whether it wa relevant , ” he added .
 Still , when he first read it in 2012 , he recall being smitten — finding it “ utterly feminist and tragic ” a it confronted “ the eternal question of the role of woman in society . ”
 In the summer of 2014 , he directed a workshop of the play at the Ignition Festival at Victory Gardens , where he is the artistic director . In 2015 , he and Mr. Hnath took “ Hillary ” to Cape Cod .
 Then a now , it wasn ’ t meant a biography . Guarded and battle-scarred though she is , the Hillary in the play isn ’ t quite the Hillary Clinton from the news . The same go for the men around her — her husband , Bill , though he ’ s still a thousand time more cavalier than she ’ ll ever be ; her opponent , Barack ( known in earlier version of the play a The Other Guy ) ; and her strategist , Mark Penn .
 Like Mr. Hnath ’ s other play about famous figure ( Walt Disney , Isaac Newton ) , “ Hillary ” blend fiction with fact , aiming to subvert what audience member think they already know . But Laura Colleluori , who directed the play for Second Thought Theater in Dallas in January 2018 , said the effect is to bring the audience closer to Mrs. Clinton .
 “ Talking about her a a fictional character is kind of the only way that we can have a fair conversation about the real woman , ” she said . “ It give you the option , the chance , the request even , to grant her maybe a little bit of the humanity that 40 year in the public eye can kind of take away from you . ”
 In the version of the “ Hillary ” script published in 2017 by Dramatists Play Service , Mr. Hnath admonishes performer against imitating the real Clintons ( “ Don ’ t do it ! ” ) , then add for director : “ Don ’ t even try to cast actor who look like these people . ”
 All of the show ’ s full production leading up to Broadway have cast Hillary a an African-American woman , a directorial choice not required by the script . An audition notice for understudy and possible replacement in the Broadway production , three of whose star are white , specified an ethnicity only for actor playing Barack , who must be of African descent .
 The opening monologue in the published script asks the audience to consider the likelihood of “ an infinite number of planet earths. ” And then : “ It would be very helpful if — a you watch this play — you were to imagine that the play take place on one of those slightly different planet earth located billion of light year away from our own . ”
 Spectators , of course , don ’ t always do a they ’ re asked . Mr. Yew remembers that at Victory Gardens , “ everyone brought their garbage , really , to the play ” ; whatever they were thinking about the election came into the theater with them . Some got upset , worried that “ Hillary ” would harm the real Mrs. Clinton ’ s chance .
 That same spring , right after the Chicago run , Ken Rus Schmoll directed a production at the Philadelphia Theater Company . After the election , though , few other staging followed . ( Through a spokeswoman , neither Mr. Hnath nor anyone affiliated with the Broadway production would comment for this article , but Mr. Yew said that the playwright had been revising “ Hillary . ” )
 The Hnath work that ’ s truly taken off is “ A Doll ’ s House , Part 2 , ” which opened on Broadway in April 2017 and , according to American Theater magazine , is the current season ’ s most-produced play . The first Broadway show for Mr. Hnath , who until then wa a downtown darling known for brainy experimentation , it won Ms. Metcalf her first Tony .
 In “ Doll ’ s House , ” she played Nora , Mr. Hnath ’ s reworking of Ibsen ’ s classic character — a strong-minded , convention-breaking woman , a figure important to the cultural imagination and much deliberated there . The same could be said of Hillary Clinton , except of course that she is also a living human being .
 There is a certain logic to both of these play , and both of these famous character , appearing on Broadway post-pussy hat — written by the same playwright , performed by the same actress .
 In his note for the published “ Hillary , ” Mr. Hnath sound almost eager to discover how the play come across without a Clinton candidacy hanging in the balance .
 He want audience to be able to consider “ what her run for the presidency mean. ” But if that ’ s going to happen , he warns , the tone of the production ha to be just right .
 “ Tread carefully , ” he writes .
 Hillary — the one in his world , like the one in ours — know that stage direction well .

 At the Golden Globes in 2018 , Time ’ s Up , the Hollywood-led initiative to combat workplace sexual harassment , made a triumphant debut : Stars donned black in solidarity , and Oprah Winfrey delivered an impassioned call for support .
 In the year since , the group ha notched a string of success , big and small . It ha also faced two notable setback , including the sudden resignation of it chief executive this week , during it quest to overcome skepticism about it mission and momentum .
 “ How do you fix century of patriarchy in 12 month , right ? That ’ s a big ask , ” said Christy Haubegger , an agent and one of Time ’ s Up ’ s founder .
 The organization ’ s crown jewel , a legal-defense fund for lower-wage worker , now ha nearly $ 25 million in donation , up from $ 13 million when the group wa formed . Of that , $ 6 million ha gone toward 100 legal case and investigation , with more than 800 lawyer signed on to assist , many working pro bono or at discounted rate . Two talent agency that answered the Time ’ s Up challenge to reach gender parity in pay and leadership by 2020 , ICM Partners and Creative Artists Agency , report that they are on track to make good on their pledge .
 And at the urging of Time ’ s Up , CBS donated part of the severance money initially earmarked for it ousted chief executive , Les Moonves , to various advocacy organization . Time ’ s Up had suggested $ 120 million ; CBS went with $ 20 million , including $ 2 million for Time ’ s Up cause . ( The CBS board ha since denied Moonves any payment . )
 The group nabbed more glowing headline this year , artfully taking advantage of the award season spotlight , it specialty . Onstage at the Golden Globes last month , the actress Regina King pledged that woman would make up 50 percent of her production ’ hire for the next two year . At Sundance , the actress Tessa Thompson vowed to work with a female director on a feature film in the next 18 month , a promise echoed by dozen of actor and producer , including Jordan Peele and J.J. Abrams , along with seven studio , among them Universal and Warner Bros .
 “ These are thing that , two year ago , would ’ ve never come out of my mouth , ” said Stacy Smith , the executive director of the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative at University of Southern California and a Time ’ s Up member , of those recent accomplishment . “ And here we are . It ’ s a new day . ”
 Still , the group , formed in response to accusation against the producer Harvey Weinstein — he now face sexual assault charge in Manhattan , which he ha denied — ha also experienced prominent disappointment . On Monday , it chief executive , Lisa Borders , resigned after le than four month on the job . The departure wa amicable — in a statement she said a family matter left her no other option — and the hunt is on for a successor .
 The producer Shonda Rhimes and Katie McGrath , core Time ’ s Up member , said in a statement that the group ’ s mission to dismantle “ a very damaged culture ” wa unchanged . “ While we ’ re sorry to see Lisa go , Time ’ s Up is steadfast in creating a framework to combat that culture , ” they said .
 The group ’ s clout is also not yet clear . In January , Skydance Media hired a it animation chief John Lasseter , who left his leadership post at Pixar and Disney in 2018 after he wa accused of unwanted touching . ( He ha apologized to anyone who felt his gesture “ crossed the line . ” )
 Skydance had consulted with Time ’ s Up , but the group publicly slammed the hire ; the organization have differing account about whether Time ’ s Up made it objection clear in advance . ( Lasseter ’ s hiring prompted Emma Thompson to exit a voice-over role in a forthcoming animated Skydance movie , a representative for the actress confirmed Wednesday . ) Several Time ’ s Up member said the episode wa le about the limit of the group ’ s power than about inertia in the industry .
 “ I don ’ t think it show Time ’ s Up doesn ’ t have teeth , ” said Tessa Thompson . “ I think it show that what doe have teeth is people make decision based purely on the bottom line , and on business , and frankly that will continue to happen . ”
 Until Borders wa hired in October , the group wa run almost entirely by volunteer effort . Their sprawling initiative included a 26-member commission that is now no longer affiliated with Time ’ s Up . ( The panel is headed by Anita Hill , who said the development of a system for reporting and responding to claim of harassment and bias wa still underway . )
 Time ’ s Up is far from the first effort aimed at correcting power imbalance in Hollywood . Still , with member including Reese Witherspoon , Eva Longoria , Ava DuVernay and Rhimes , it is easily the most high-profile . There have been grumbling that the group is cliquey and disorganized , and that it member have used meeting to network . There have also been whispered concern that it ha overshadowed decade of work by others long devoted to advancing the gender equity cause .
 Calls for studio to adopt more representative hiring on camera and behind the scene date , at least , to the ’ 70 ; organization like the Representation Project , the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media , and Women in Film were all largely created to that end . Yet none matched the wattage of Time ’ s Up , whose reach extends beyond entertainment , with affiliate group like Time ’ s Up Tech , Time ’ s Up Advertising and Time ’ s Up Healthcare formed or in the work .
 “ They are bold , and they are loud , and they have the ability to amplify their mission and message better than any other organization in the space , ” said Amy Baer , the president of Women in Film .
 The group ’ s halo effect ha reached beyond Hollywood . Tina Tchen , who spearheaded the creation of the legal defense fund , said that thousand of caller , hailing from 60 industry , have contacted the organization for guidance , and that two-thirds were lower income .
 Katherine Wutchiett , a lawyer at Legal Aid at Work , which represents lower income worker in San Francisco , said five of her organization ’ s case received money from the fund . That included a lawsuit by Jennifer Atkinson , who left her job on a military base after being harassed for pumping breast milk . “ It ha allowed attorney to have additional freedom in the type of case that they take , ” Wutchiett said .
 The woman of Time ’ s Up say this is precisely what they had set out to do : Use their resource and clout to help woman lacking both . Hilary Rosen , a Time ’ s Up organizer and strategist with SKDKnickerbocker , a communication firm , said that , a opposed to the ’ 60 and ’ 70 , nowadays more woman wield the power to lift other woman up .
 “ Women are not outside banging on the door , ” she said . “ Women inside the room , with power and money , are helping to make change for people who are still outside , who aren ’ t yet in the right room . ”
 An earlier version of this article misstated the connection between Time ’ s Up and a commission headed by Anita Hill . The commission wa formed by Time ’ s Up , but the two are no longer affiliated . The article also misstated Time ’ s Up ’ s initial staffing . There were a few paid employee ; it wa not all-volunteer .

 Wealth Matters

 Growing up in central Connecticut in the 1980s , Joshua Siegel loved everything about flying . He couldn ’ t afford flying lesson , let alone his own plane , but he kept dreaming .
 By his 20 , he had achieved some financial success and wa able to take advantage of a new tax deduction meant to spur private plane sale in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack .
 Using the tax break , he deducted the entire cost of a new Cessna more quickly than he could have otherwise — five year versus 20 year or more . The plane wa restricted to business use , but it fulfilled a childhood dream for virtually no money .
 “ My cost to fly , between 2001 and 2005 , wa free , ” he said . After that , he sold the plane , and had to pay tax on the sale .
 The deduction — known a bonus depreciation — wa enhanced in Republican lawmaker ’ sweeping tax overhaul , which wa meant to strengthen manufacturing by offering a tax break to any business that invested in equipment or machinery . But because it also allowed the full cost of a plane to be deducted in the first year of ownership , it ha bolstered sale of new and used plane .
 Shipments of general aviation aircraft rose nearly 5 percent in 2018 from the year before , according to data from the General Aviation Manufacturers Association , an industry trade group .
 Mr. Siegel , now the chief executive of StoneCastle Partners , which invests in community bank , said he used the tax deduction to buy a used plane last year and wa planning to use it again when he take delivery of a 2019 Cirrus SR20 , which cost $ 600,000 . Better still , the tax break is structured so that most of his plane cost , like fuel and maintenance , will be deductible , too .
 The tax deduction ’ s benefit are twofold .
 First , it allows a business to deduct the cost of the machinery , dollar for dollar , in one year . Typically , business equipment is amortized over a multiyear schedule , which is calculated based on how long the equipment might last , a formula known a useful life .
 Second , the updated version extends the deduction to used equipment . In theory , some people might trade up to something newer , while others might buy something used that they would not have bought otherwise .
 Adding used aircraft to the deduction ha been a boon to sale , said Lewis Liebert , chief executive of Performance Flight , an aircraft training , management and chartering company .
 “ Buying used without bonus depreciation wa a big reach for some people , ” he said .
 It ha also helped the aircraft market . “ The inventory of used aircraft wa too high , and it created a disparity in value ” that hurt sale of new plane , he said .
 It may seem tantalizing to use this tax deduction a a way to get a free plane , but it ’ s not that simple .
 On the face of it , anyone can deduct 100 percent of a plane ’ s purchase price and maintenance expense if the plane is used for nonrecreational purpose or leased to a flight school . After the first year , to keep the deduction , the owner ha to ensure that the plane is used at least 50 percent of the time for business .
 Mr. Siegel said he put his used plane , a 2011 Cirrus , into a rental program through Performance Flight at Westchester County Airport in White Plains , and he intends to do the same with his new plane . This arrangement , called a lease-back program , fulfills the Internal Revenue Service requirement on business use .
 Thomas Rossomondo , a certified public accountant who work with FlyWealthServe , a consulting firm that specializes in aviation , said qualifying for bonus depreciation wa more nuanced than it seemed .
 To be able to deduct the full cost , for example , the owner could use the plane 50 percent of the time for business , 25 percent for flight training and 25 percent for personal but non-entertainment use . An example of the last one , he said , would be transporting relative somewhere ; a violation would be taking the same relative to Disney World .
 “ There are gray area , ” Mr. Rossomondo said . But he said that FlyWealthServe ’ s client wanted to be compliant because of the auditing risk associated with such a large deduction . “ They don ’ t want to create red flag , over and above taking depreciation for a plane , ” he said .
 If the I.R.S . find an owner is not in compliance , the penalty are severe . The owner could lose the deduction and be required to depreciate the plane over a longer period , which could be five to seven year depending on the type of aircraft , said Jerald D. August , tax partner and head of the international tax and wealth planning practice group at Fox Rothschild . That substantially increase the cost paid for the plane .
 “ You need to be a stickler for record-keeping , ” Mr. August said .
 Additionally , not all state allow the same level of bonus depreciation that the federal government doe . In Connecticut , someone buying a plane would not get a break the first year , but can depreciate the plane ’ s cost over four year , said Michael D ’ Addio , tax lawyer and principal at Marcum in New Haven .
 At the end of the plane ’ s life , though , the owner could get hit with something called depreciation recapture , a term used for belatedly paying tax that were deferred , Mr. Rossomondo said . Of course many plane owner might simply buy another plane and start the depreciation cycle all over again .
 “ Eventually , you ’ re going to sell your last aircraft and you ’ re going to have to recognize the gain , ” he said .
 If the plane doe not continue to be used at least 50 percent of the time for business , the owner may be subject to depreciation recapture before it is sold .
 Aside from benefiting business owner and family office with the mean to buy plane , the loophole offer an advantage to recreational pilot who rent by the hour by providing new , safe plane to fly .
 The actor Anthony Edwards , who played Goose to Tom Cruise ’ s Maverick in the 1986 action movie “ Top Gun , ” learned to fly a plane in 2011 , 25 year after the film made Navy fighter pilot cool .
 “ I am the guy who come in and rent and make it possible for others to buy plane , ” said Mr. Edwards , who take lesson at Performance Flight . “ What impress me is , there are new plane coming in , and a a pilot , you get to experience state of the art . ”
 Rentals start at $ 400 an hour , not cheap , but a far cry from the cost of buying a plane .
 But a enticing the tax deduction is for some enthusiast , others balk at the I.R.S . restriction . Dr. Randall V. Ehrlich , an orthopedic surgeon who life in Greenwich , Conn. , and ha three office around New York , decided not to use the bonus depreciation incentive . He said he could fly to two of his office more quickly than driving , but he did not like the constraint imposed by the deduction or the lease-back structure .
 “ I might get out of the office early and might want to go fly . If the plane is being used by someone else , that would make me very unhappy , ” Dr. Ehrlich said . “ Or spur of the moment , we might fly down to Philadelphia for the afternoon . You lose some of the fun . ”
 Even without the lease-back component , the tax deduction could still have allowed him to write off the full value of his plane , which cost about $ 800,000 , if he used it just for business in the first year . But the I.R.S . rule are meant for piece of equipment with a strict business use , not a Saturday jaunt to grab lunch .
 But following the rule can provide an extra perk : rental income from the fight school .
 “ I normally wouldn ’ t have bought a new plane , ” Mr. Siegel said . “ I ’ d buy a used plane , but now , with a new plane , there ’ s significant income each month . ”

 As I wa watching the new animated film “ Wonder Park , ” about a young girl ’ s imagined amusement park come to life , I wasn ’ t buying the physic of a roller coaster . “ The hill are way too high and steep , ” I thought , “ the curve too sharp. ” And for a moment , it wa lost on me that I wa analyzing something carrying a giant blue talking bear .
 Welcome to my coaster-nerd world . I spend a lot of my summer on some of the wildest roller coaster around the country . While indulging in the thrill ( hand up , always ) , I ’ m also taking these ride very seriously , thinking about the quality of the engineering and scrutinizing the mechanic of each rise and fall . But I did ultimately give in to the hyperbolic wonder of “ Wonder Park. ” In dreaming up attraction like the Sky Flinger — sphere with rider that are sent sailing through the air — June , the film ’ s young lead , displayed the outsize creativity of the best inventor . I admired that , and I could relate . June had her Wonderland . I had my Fun World .
 When I wa 10 , I laid out detailed plan for a theme park and built an entire narrative around it in a notebook that filled up over the year . There were a series of crude ride sketch and a map . Fun World wa founded by the pioneering , conveniently named genius H.G . Fun . He divided his park into gloriously themed section , like Car Land ( well before Disney ’ s Cars Land , thank you ) , Up Down and Around Land and , yes , Coaster Land . There were 90 ride in all , a well a a giant Fun World Globe and a Fun Dome . But the coaster were what mattered most to H.G .
 And so it wa with me . Growing up in Oklahoma in the ’ 80 , I had a good life , surrounded by family and close friend , but I longed to be somewhere bigger , like the place I wa seeing in the movie I consumed . Roller coaster gave me the first taste of that wider world .
 During visit to the state fair with my family , I discovered my penchant for thrill-seeking in carnival attraction like the Scrambler and the Tilt-a-Whirl . But the fair wa missing the majesty of larger-than-life roller coaster . We seemingly had to travel to another country for those : Texas . Each summer , we would drive three hour to Fort Worth to see my cousin and go to Six Flags Over Texas together .
 On the highway a we approached the park , one of the most beautiful , most terrifying sight came into view : a steel beast called the Shock Wave . It had not one , but two loop , back to back ! I avoided it at all cost . I feared I ’ d faint after the first loop , leaving my limp , unconscious body gliding through the second . And yet , I wa obsessed with it .
 Another fearful obsession wa the Runaway Mine Train , a coaster with a track that seemed endless and disappeared through the wood . It wa even more frightening than the Shock Wave because I couldn ’ t see the dastardly place it might be going . There were rumor it went underwater . Underwater ! It sounded like something a maniac would dream up . But one time , waiting outside the ride , one of my sister put the pressure on me to ride it . She convinced me , assured me , that it didn ’ t , couldn ’ t possibly , go underwater . I finally relented . Lo and behold , the very last part of the ride went through a makeshift saloon and plunged down into an underwater tunnel . I ’ d never known such deception .
 But I ’ d also never known such excitement . It wa a true rush , the moment that solidified my coaster love . I became braver and more willing to give bigger ride a try . I met the Shock Wave head-on , and made it through both loop with my consciousness intact . Theme park became the place where I , and my imagination , could run wild .
 Just a momentous wa our epic family trip to Los Angeles . After a three-day Greyhound bus ride that wa an adventure in itself , we headed to Six Flags Magic Mountain . Pulling into the parking lot , I faced Colossus , a giant white wooden coaster that wa bigger than any I ’ d seen . ( Using many of it original material , it ha now been converted into a wood-steel hybrid called Twisted Colossus , my favorite coaster . )
 That trip also brought me in touch with the glamour of Hollywood , entertainment having long been a way that I bonded with my family . Thanks to packed trip to the drive-in and Saturday afternoon spent watching movie marathon on cable , we became steeped in pop culture . In Los Angeles , we were pro at spotting the most minor of celebrity on the street or at the beach — a backup dancer from the TV version of “ Fame , ” that one guy in that Michael Keaton movie . My entertainment passion and my amusement passion were merging in one magical city , and I didn ’ t want to leave .
 So back in Oklahoma , I started building the world , Fun World , I wanted to live in . My ride were far from practical . Why have a log flume with one big drop when you could build it on multilevel terrain and have three giant splash ? Or how about the ultimate indoor coaster , with the kind of spiral , inversion and 90-degree straight-down dive that would put Space Mountain to shame ? O.K. , there would be no Fun World without Disneyland and Six Flags a inspiration . ( Also a shout-out to Wally World , the fictional park from one of my favorite movie a a kid , “ National Lampoon ’ s Vacation , ” which wa partly filmed at Magic Mountain . ) But I wanted to create something that would match up .
 That notebook started filling up with showbiz invention , too , including a movie star I named Edrall Casceese . He made blockbuster comedy , mind-blowing sci-fi spectacle , musical , you name it . And there wa a pop star , Jayson . All of his song were chart-toppers ; I even recorded them on a cassette . Years later , indie movie would be of great interest to me , but a a kid , I craved hit .
 As I got older , the character and the park stayed in my head . By high school , my interest in movie had only grown , and I wanted to learn more about how they operated . The interest in roller coaster also expanded , leading me to more park in many more place over the year .
 My first move after leaving Oklahoma in my early 20 wa to Dallas , a mere 20-minute drive from Six Flags Over Texas , where the Shock Wave and the Runaway Mine Train first prepared me for something bigger . I would eventually make my way , not to Los Angeles but to the opposite coast , covering the movie and occasionally cataloging my roller coaster experience .
 It is a rare roller coaster that try to give you an experience , not just a scare . Here are a handful that do .
 In my theme park travel , I ’ ve seen some of the wacky proposition from those youthful drawing ( like a raft ride that requires an elevator to get the raft to the top , or coaster with straight-down dive ) become technological reality . As with June and her Wonderland , having the courage to dream big , and even a bit outrageously , ha led to some surprising place .

 After 250 year or so , the piano concerto ha some life in it yet .
 This week alone , two piano concerto by two eminent composer , Thomas Adès and John Adams , will have their premiere on the same evening . They follow close on the heel of another , by the Pulitzer Prize-winner Caroline Shaw , presented by the Seattle Symphony earlier this year .
 On the East Coast , Mr. Adès will conduct the Boston Symphony Orchestra in his unambiguously titled Concerto for Piano and Orchestra , featuring Kirill Gerstein . On the other side of the country , the Los Angeles Philharmonic , under Gustavo Dudamel , will play Mr. Adams ’ s “ Must the Devil Have All the Good Tunes ? ” with Yuja Wang .
 ( No need to despair if you ’ re not in Boston or Los Angeles : Mr. Adès ’ s work travel to Carnegie Hall on March 20 , and “ Must the Devil ” come to Lincoln Center this fall , with a long list of future performance planned around the world through at least 2020 . )
 In their own postmodern way , these concerto acknowledge the genre ’ s long and wide-ranging history , while also searching for what else it is capable of . Here are preview of both .
 If this piece ha a predecessor , it ’ s Mr. Adès ’ s “ In Seven Days ” ( 2008 ) , a work that move fluidly between concerto and tone poem . Mr. Gerstein wa performing it with the Boston Symphony in 2012 when he gathered the courage to ask the composer to write something for him .
 “ I remember saying that I knew I had to stand in line for a while , ” Mr. Gerstein said . “ And Tom charmingly said , ‘ Does it have to be a solo piece ? ’ ” ( Mr. Gerstein later learned from Mr. Adès ’ s publisher that he had “ skipped the line , ” by a lot . )
 Mr. Adès , 48 , wanted to write , he recalled , “ a proper piano concerto. ” And in Mr. Gerstein he found a muse to explore the form ’ s tradition and the idea of virtuosity itself .
 The two met in the mid-2000s while performing Stravinsky ’ s “ Les Noces , ” and have since become friend with the kind of mutual admiration that lead to new music : Mr. Adès arranged a Berceuse from his opera “ The Exterminating Angel ” for Mr. Gerstein , who gave it premiere last month in Vienna . They ’ ve also embarked on a two-piano recital tour that will stop at Zankel Hall in New York on March 13 .
 Mr. Adès ’ s nod to tradition begin with the title of the piece — unadorned and unpoetic . And , like nearly every concerto throughout history , it is in three movement , opening with the statement of a theme from both the piano and the orchestra .
 But there is always a twist with Mr. Adès . He revel in homage and quotation — just listen to his delightful Belle Époque pastiche score for the film “ Colette ” — and here he find way to adhere to convention while at the same time breaking free with surprising melody and dizzying demand on the pianist .
 “ I ’ ve really asked this piece what it wanted to do , ” Mr. Adès said . “ What it wanted to do wa speak along traditional line , the way a tree is a traditional form : It will always have a trunk . But I suppose part of me feel that the most freshness can be found in revisiting the tradition . ”
 While preparing for the premiere , Mr. Gerstein — who with this week ’ s performance is reuniting with the Boston Symphony after recording Busoni ’ s colossal Piano Concerto in C with the orchestra — ha often checked in with Mr. Adès , sending cellphone video and asking interpretive question in text message .
 “ I feel like I don ’ t have any anxiety , ” Mr. Adès said . “ Kirill seems to absorb it , and it speaks through him . It ’ s nice not to have any worry . ”
 “ I can ’ t play the piano , ” Mr. Adams , 72 , confessed in an interview . “ I have never even taken a piano lesson . ”
 That hasn ’ t stopped him from writing some of the most spellbinding contemporary music for the instrument , like “ Phrygian Gates ” or the joyous and sweeping “ Grand Pianola Music ” ; or the duet “ Hallelujah Junction , ” which wa inspired by the name of a truck stop and wa a case , he ha often said , of a title looking for a piece .
 His new concerto ha a similar origin story . While working on his oratorio “ The Gospel According to the Other Mary , ” he said , he came across an old New Yorker article that included a phrase begging to be a title : “ Must the Devil Have All the Good Tunes ? ” Mr. Adams hoped the quote came from Chuck Berry , but found out later it wa Martin Luther ’ s .
 The word also suggested , Mr. Adams said , the Totentanz , or danse macabre . You can hear a similarity between Liszt ’ s “ Totentanz ” and “ Must the Devil ” : Both piece begin with a low and lumbering piano part over the orchestra . But whereas Liszt open with a Dies Irae melody , Mr. Adams aim for something funky and distinctly American . ( The orchestration call for a honky-tonk piano and a bass guitar . )
 What follows is a concerto that more or le adheres to fast-slow-fast convention but within a sui generis , single-movement form ( a opposed to three , like the Adès ) — similar to the way Mr. Adams ha written symphony-length work without identifying them a such , like “ Harmonielehre ” and “ Naïve and Sentimental Music . ”
 “ We live in a time when there are no template , ” he said . “ Mozart wa a genius but he didn ’ t have to find a new template for each piece . Each of u , when we write a new piece now , whether it ’ s a 22-year-old composer or someone my age , we have to decide it form . ”
 The piano part , though it will be played by other soloist including Jeremy Denk and Vikingur Olafsson in the future , wa written specifically for Ms. Wang — a superstar who delivers blurry-handed dazzle in showy standard but nuanced reading in more quietly demanding work , like Robert Schumann ’ s Piano Concerto in A minor .
 “ She ’ s in there a lot , ” Mr. Adams said of “ Must the Devil. ” He recalled being impressed by a video of Ms. Wang playing Prokofiev with the conductor Claudio Abbado , but found “ real depth ” in a recording of Rachmaninoff ’ s Études-Tableaux . “ I thought : There ’ s something there besides the flash . ”

This being Los Angeles — and the sister being local and film fanatic , who just two day ago staged their first fashion show on their home turf , with silhouette inspired by Hollywood musical — each stopping place on the itinerary ha a movie tie-in .

 “ Pink ’ s show up in so many film , ” say Kate , 40 . She vividly remembers the Pink ’ s scene in “ Minnie and Moskowitz ” ( 1971 ) , whose director , John Cassavetes , wa a fan . David Lynch would swing by three decade later to film part of “ Mullholland Drive . ”
 “ When I heard the Rodarte girl were coming to Pink ’ s , I had this very pregnant pause , ” say Gloria Pink , who run the family business with her husband , Richard , and sister-in-law Beverly . “ High fashion … and hot dog ? But it goes. ” The Mulleavys are served 12-inch jalapeño dog , fry , onion ring and Diet Cokes . Additional dog are stacked on a platter with “ Pink ’ s Loves Kate and Laura ” elegantly written on the wiener in condiment . “ Wow , the mustard work is really impressive , ” say Laura , 38 .
 More than designer , the Mulleavy sister are creative connector . They partnered with Darren Aronofsky on many of the costume for his 2010 ballet film “ Black Swan ” They directed Kirsten Dunst in the 2017 thriller “ Woodshock. ” They worked with Frank Gehry on reimagining “ Don Giovanni ” for a 2012 Los Angeles Philharmonic production at the Walt Disney Concert Hall .
 Many of their collaboration began at the next stop : the 100-year-old Musso & Frank Grill at 6667 Hollywood Boulevard . There , career waiter serve throwback dish from largely unchanged menu to actor and industry type tucked into row of crimson leather booth . Each booth ha it original brass hat rack .
 “ If we are going to meet someone we might work with , we will usually have our first meeting there , ” say Kate . The sister consider it a litmus test for a successful partnership . They will ask to be seated in Marilyn Monroe ’ s booth and will likely order steak or the mac and cheese made with bucatini . They swear by the restaurant ’ s very stiff martini . “ I also love how they serve them , ” say Kate . “ In a carafe with small martini glass . ”
 “ We ’ ve actually never been to the High Tower , ” Kate confides , “ but we ’ ve always loved it from ‘ The Long Goodbye , ’ ” Robert Altman ’ s 1973 movie in which a hunky Elliott Gould play Raymond Chandler ’ s detective , Philip Marlowe . In the film , Marlowe life surrounded by sybarite at High Tower Court , a secluded residential complex in the Hollywood Hills .
 We climb a steep hill to a sort of hidden entrance deep in the slope . Farther up is Alta Loma Terrace , a car-free microhood of small house and apartment backing into a piece of sky behind the Hollywood Bowl . Developed in the first half of the previous century , the area incorporates the 1923 Otto Bollman House designed by Lloyd Wright ( son of Frank Lloyd Wright ) , a well a a five-story private elevator built in the 1920s to look like an Italian bell tower ( 2178 High Tower Drive ) .
 The sister step quickly into and out of an old old-fashioned elevator car . It is a no-go without a key , and they are wary of trespassing . Outside , they start taking selfies .
 “ Now we are heading to Pasadena , ” Laura say , which is their home . “ Einstein lived in the house next door to ours , when he wa a visiting professor at Caltech , ” add Kate . “ We met someone recently whose grandmother used to rent the house to him . She said he wa always on time with his rent . ”
 At 1000 Mission Street in South Pasadena , we arrive at the clapboard house with a rocking-chair front porch that represented the home of the spooky psychopath Michael Myers in John Carpenter ’ s 1978 movie “ Halloween. ” ( Scheduled for demolition , it wa rescued and moved to this spot a block away . ) “ The house , the tree , the light , ” say Kate . “ Even today you can totally feel those scene when Jamie Lee Curtis is driving and being followed . ”
 Stepping out of the car , we take a closer look at the building , which sits on a corner and face a railroad track . A train is approaching , and the crossing bell sound a low and tinny warning . “ It ’ s like we our getting our very own Halloween theme , ” Laura say .
 The sister , who count Halloween a their favorite holiday , skip up the few step to what is currently a real estate office . “ The sign on the door say , ‘ Movie fan , please don ’ t disturb tenant , ’ ” Kate yell from the porch , taking a photo of the sign . “ That should be the name of this article ! ”
 The next stop is another Pasadena residence worthy of it own IMDB page . “ I think Castle Green must be where they filmed Gena Rowlands ’ s apartment in ‘ Opening Night , ’ ” say Kate , showing u photo of the set on her phone . The 1977 film , a cult Cassavetes drama about an aging Broadway actress , make generous use of dark wood and plush red textile .
 Castle Green ( 99 South Raymond Avenue ) wa built at the turn of the 20th century a part of a hotel complex targeting affluent Easterners who had come to town to see the Tournament of Roses . Now an apartment complex and private event space , the seven-story Mediterranean- and Moorish-style building is impeccably preserved .
 “ This place definitely feel haunted , ” say Kate a we wander around the complex . Vast , frozen in time and with not a resident in view , it is like the Overlook Hotel in Stanley Kubrick ’ s “ The Shining , ” only with much better weather .
 Dior Chase , the venue ’ s event coordinator , greets u , and while she note that movie including “ The Sting ” and “ The Last Samurai ” were filmed there , she can not confirm “ Opening Night. ” Kate and Laura spin through the ballroom , up to the top floor , down to the lady ’ room and out through the garden .
 The adventure is coming to a close . “ We just love Avalon Vintage , ” say Laura of their favorite consignment shop , which buy and sell secondhand fashion , a well a classic vinyl ( 106 North Avenue 56 ) . While many designer thumb through vintage shop rack for inspiration , the sister prefer to spend hour at this Highland Park institution simply chatting with it owner , Carmen Hawk and Rodney Klein .
 But fatigue from their fashion show ha caught up , and they decide to talk about Carmen and Rodney instead of paying a planned visit .
 “ They have such an incredible eye and wealth of knowledge about film and music history , ” say Laura . “ We shop there mainly for gift and sometimes ourselves. ” Their favorite find ? Vintage Bette Davis and Joan Crawford 1970s T-shirts from the store ’ s Lonely Ladies series . They have not , however , worn them out on the same night — yet .

 California Today
 By Jill Cowan
 Good morning .
 ( If you don ’ t get California Today by email , here ’ s the sign-up . )
 Yesterday , my colleague Thomas Fuller , Jennifer Medina and Conor Dougherty took a hard look at the future of America ’ s infrastructure project , like California ’ s high-speed rail . More specifically : Are project that big even possible anymore , given the cost and regulation ?
 In California , that regulation ha reached notoriously byzantine height and is epitomized in four letter : C.E.Q.A . Conor explains how that happened :
 The rapidly escalating cost of California ’ s high-speed rail project ha led to a loss of political support and cast a cloud over it prospect , raising big question about America ’ s ability to take on big project a it once did . The train ’ s problem also highlight a paradox here and across the nation : It ’ s often hardest to build in the populated area where investment is needed most .
 For those trying to carry out such project in California , nothing is more daunting than the California Environmental Quality Act , or C.E.Q.A . Signed by Gov . Ronald Reagan in 1970 , the statute ha become a widely used legal tool for delaying or stopping public-works project from the massive to the micro — even , until recently , those designating bike lane . And those case can pit environmental objection against environmental goal .
 It is widely agreed in California that new housing and infrastructure should be built in and around population center , to curb sprawl , to cut down on driving , and to help the state meet it ambitious goal to reduce carbon dioxide emission . But lawsuit filed under the environmental quality act have often taken aim at just such project .
 According to a 2015 study , about 80 percent of the environmental lawsuit filed in California over a three-year period were targeted at “ infill ” development in already populated area . Housing and infrastructure project accounted for more than half . The complaint can be brought on any number of environmental ground , like the dust and noise generated or the impact on view .
 Several year ago a proposal to add passenger train to a cargo rail line already in use wa challenged on the ground that it would lead to additional squealing and grease drippage . In the case of the high-speed rail project , designed to link the Central Valley with the Bay Area and Los Angeles , a C.E.Q.A . lawsuit by the Silicon Valley enclave of Atherton challenged whether the rail authority had adequately studied the engineering of the train ’ s route .
 That case ultimately failed , but even fighting litigation add to a project ’ s cost and can often delay it . The rail project ha been challenged on other legal ground a well , including it adherence to the term of a bond issue financing it .
 Increased investment in road , bridge and power plant ha won support across party line . But a California ’ s experience illustrates , talk about big project is easy . Routing them around legal land mine is hard .

 A Word With
 By Kathryn Shattuck
 For the last decade — a he snared an Oscar nomination for Steve McQueen ’ s “ 12 Years a Slave , ” swaggered through the National Theater production of “ Everyman ” and wielded magical weapon in Marvel ’ s “ Doctor Strange ” — Chiwetel Ejiofor ha had his mind on other thing .
 When he wasn ’ t racking up accolade in front of the camera , Ejiofor wa figuring out how to step behind it and make a movie about William Kamkwamba , who at 13 saved his Malawi village from drought and famine by building a windmill .
 The result , “ The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind ” — Ejiofor ’ s feature directorial debut , based on Kamkwamba ’ s 2009 best-selling memoir — arrives on Netflix on March 1 a well a in select theater for a weeklong run .
 “ I read it when it first came out and immediately wanted to get the right . I just had a strong instinct , ” Ejiofor said . “ It wa talking about thing that everybody wa dealing with globally ” — democracy , economics , the environment — “ but concentrated on these people who were at the thin end at the wedge . ”
 “ I found a project I loved so deeply that I wa prepared to doggedly stick with over many year , ” he added .
 Born into a farming family , Kamkwamba ( played by Maxwell Simba , with Ejiofor a his father , Trywell ) wa forced to quit high school after his parent couldn ’ t scrape together the tuition . Undeterred , he sneaked into class and the library , where an American textbook called “ Using Energy ” inspired him to use bicycle part to build a windmill to pump water for crop — and in the process keep his village alive a corrupt politician abandoned it .
 Kamkwamba wa unable to return to school for five year , until his invention captivated supporter who helped him gain entry into the African Leadership Academy , and then into Dartmouth , where he graduated in 2014 .
 In an interview at a Lower East Side hotel , Ejiofor , 41 — who is London-based and wa on a work layover between the Sundance and Berlin film festival , where his film captured warm review — spoke about his passion project .
 Here are edited excerpt from the conversation .
 Can you pinpoint the moment when you knew you had to make this movie ?
 I wa very struck by this idea of a 13-year-old sneaking into school , and I considered what my attitude to school wa when I wa 13 — and the idea of how inconceivable it would be that I ’ d have tried to sneak past teacher in order to get into a double math class . For William to find his way through in that kind of situation just seemed extremely hopeful to me .
 You first had to write the screenplay before shooting in 2017 . Did the idea behind his story shift during those year ?
 A lot of these idea became almost more pertinent over time . When I started writing it , there really wasn ’ t a question mark over the nature of democracy in the Western world , so it seemed like a very African issue that this [ corrupt politician ] come along and he ’ s beating people up at rally . By the time we finished the film , these idea of whether there are limit to democracy were everywhere , in the States and with Brexit . There wa also the financial crash , and the idea of deregulation or unregulated market wa all people were talking about . Years later it ’ s so much more a part of how we think about the potential disastrous consequence of some of the action — like looking at a famine that wa really about unregulated grain price .
 As an actor , do you see the scene in your head when you ’ re writing ?
 Yeah , I mean all of it . You hear the scene , you play out the scene . I would be seemingly crazy , walking around playing all the part , just invested in all of the moment of the film .
 What is William doing now ?
 Now he work in North Carolina and in Malawi , and through his organization Moving Windmills , he ’ s setting up an innovation center in Lilongwe [ the capital of Malawi ] to support young people who have idea — innovator , inventor , thinker — and put them in contact with people who could help them actualize their idea .
 Let ’ s talk about some of your other upcoming film . There wa quite a twist with your character , Baron Mordo , at the end of “ Doctor Strange. ” Have you officially signed on to reprise the role in the sequel ?
 [ Laughs ] “ I can neither confirm nor deny ” type thing .
 Hmm . You also have two Disney movie coming out . You ’ re playing Scar , the Jeremy Irons role , in the “ Lion King ” reboot with Beyoncé and Donald Glover . Did you feel any pressure reworking such a beloved film ?
 It ’ s just very exciting . Obviously the original wa so incredible and so sort of legendary . But like anything else , you have to kind of put that to one side and just try and play the part and see what happens .
 Could you maybe slip into your Scar voice for a moment ?
 [ Laughs ] We ’ ll have to wait and hear it .
 How about “ Maleficent 2 ” ? There ’ s a mysterious blank on IMDb where your character should be named , though rumor ha it you ’ re a possible love interest for Angelina Jolie .
 [ Putting on a plummy British accent ] I don ’ t know how much I can say about any of this , really . I actually came to the first “ Maleficent ” quite late . But I wa totally stunned by it and thought it wa such an interesting take on the way that we view fairy tale , and how it imprint u with certain thought and feeling right from a young age that we carry through subconsciously . I think “ Maleficent 2 ” expands that world in a fascinating way . And I ’ d worked with Angelina before [ in “ Salt ” ] and had a great time . She ’ s such a remarkable actress and just a force . It wa very cool .
 “ The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind ” is no fairy tale . You strove for authenticity by having the cast speak the native Chichewa , which required lot of subtitle . Is it a coincidence that it ended up on Netflix , like Alfonso Cuarón ’ s “ Roma , ” another heavily subtitled film ?
 When I started on the process with this film , there were only a few avenue that one could go , and those question are really commercial question because the authenticity would always butt head with this idea of , “ Does that affect the capacity for the film to reach an audience in the West ? ” In the meantime , Netflix arrives with a whole other way of accessing and engaging people . So being able to put the film into a limited release but at the same time allow it to reach a global audience is a kind of wonderful development for a film like this .
 That ’ s what I loved about “ Roma. ” I loved the fact that people have reference point now in a way that they just never did . They couldn ’ t have a conversation about something a detailed and nuanced a the specific of Mexico in the 1970s with anybody and now they really can . They have a place to start a conversation , and that ’ s a big kind of cultural change and ha an impact .
 Having a wider , more informed idea of the world is this very , very powerful possibility .

 CULVER CITY , Calif. — The film business ha chewed up Amazon over the last year and a half .
 The trouble started late in 2017 , when the tech giant moved into self-distribution . No more would it rely on established Hollywood partner to push it film into theater . But the box office game is harder than it look , and Amazon released six flop in a row . Woody Allen ’ s “ Wonder Wheel ” cost $ 25 million to make and took in only $ 1.4 million in North America . “ Beautiful Boy , ” based on the best-selling book , cost $ 23 million and collected $ 7.6 million .
 Now a company that is accustomed to entering market and making the incumbent shudder is pushing the reset button .
 “ What we struggled with , I think , wa putting too much focus on a narrow prestige lane , ” said Jennifer Salke , who took over a the head of Amazon Studios last March after successful stint at NBC and 20th Century Fox Television . “ I don ’ t think we had diverse-enough point of view in the storytelling . ”
 To that end , Ms. Salke said she had decided that the way forward for Amazon involves different “ lanes. ” Those include awards-worthy specialty film , including five she bought at the recent Sundance Film Festival , a couple for eye-popping price ; sexual thriller like “ Basic Instinct ” ( 1992 ) or “ Body Heat ” ( 1981 ) , a genre that most studio have abandoned ; and film from Blumhouse , the horror studio behind hit like “ The Purge. ” Ms. Salke also want to add a pipeline of young-adult film .
 Mr. Allen is notably absent from her strategy . “ We don ’ t have any plan to release any Woody Allen movie , ” she said , declining to comment further on the filmmaker , who is suing Amazon for backing out of a four-movie deal because of a renewed focus on allegation of sexual abuse against him .
 Amazon is now striving , at least to start , to roll out about 30 original movie a year . Budgets will range from a few million dollar up to $ 50 million or more . But not all of those movie will be released in theater . For instance , the “ sexy date-night movie , ” to use Ms. Salke ’ s description , will go directly to Prime Video , Amazon ’ s streaming service . ( Look for them on Saturday night starting this summer . ) The scary Blumhouse movie — eight have been ordered — will also skip theater .
 “ Some will be thriller-y , some will have a foot in horror , some will be more serious drama , ” said Jeremy Gold , who run Blumhouse TV with Marci Wiseman . “ We see this a a critical next step in building an ongoing relationship between Amazon and Blumhouse . ”
 Amazon emphasized that it would continue to give about 10 movie a year exclusive run in theater . Coming up : “ The Aeronauts , ” starring Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones a hot air balloon adventurer , and “ Late Night , ” a comedy starring Emma Thompson a a late-night talk-show host who hire her only female staff writer , played by Mindy Kaling .
 Even so , Amazon may start to shorten the period of exclusivity given to theater owner for some film so it can bring them to Prime Video more quickly .
 “ It ’ s really about creating that right marketing campaign , right distribution plan for each movie , allowing u to break through the cultural noise and really resonating with customer , ” said Matt Newman , one of three executive Ms. Salke ha named a film co-chiefs . The others are Julie Rapaport , who will focus on wide-appeal movie , and Ted Hope , who ha overseen Amazon ’ s art film since 2015 .
 That stance could frustrate multiplex chain , which insist on a 90-day period of exclusivity , worrying that moviegoer will be reluctant to buy ticket if they know they can catch the same film just a few week later in their living room . AMC and Regal , for instance , have refused to show Netflix ’ s “ Roma ” because Netflix offered only 21 day of exclusivity .
 Amazon ’ s first foray into the movie business wa Spike Lee ’ s “ Chi-Raq , ” a 2015 comedic drama that received strong review but did not sell many ticket . Amazon teamed with an established film company , Roadside Attractions , to release it . Amazon and Roadside reteamed the next year and found an art-house hit in the bleak drama “ Manchester by the Sea , ” which took in $ 48 million in North America and received six Oscar nomination , winning two , including best actor for Casey Affleck . “ The Big Sick , ” a comedy released in 2017 in partnership with Lionsgate , collected about $ 43 million and received an Academy Award nomination for it screenplay .
 Not bad for a newbie .
 But Amazon ’ s track record soured a it pushed toward self-distribution . Its first effort wa “ Wonder Wheel , ” which wa undoubtedly hurt by renewed scrutiny of allegation that Mr. Allen molested his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow in 1992 . Mr. Allen ha steadfastly denied the claim and wa not charged . Amazon also financed Mr. Allen ’ s next film , “ A Rainy Day in New York , ” but ha refused to release it , prompting Mr. Allen to sue .
 Amazon ’ s movie operation ha recently shown sign of life . Sitting in her office at the historic Culver Studios , which serf a Amazon ’ s entertainment headquarters , Ms. Salke noted that the company ’ s most recent film release , “ Cold War , ” a foreign-language romance , received three Oscar nomination . “ Cold War ” ha sold $ 3.6 million in ticket , a decent total for a foreign film . “ We really think it ’ ll also do well when it reach Prime Video , ” Ms. Salke said .
 When Ms. Salke arrived at Amazon , her first priority wa performing triage on the company ’ s television business . “ Transparent , ” the studio ’ s marquee hit at the time , wa in disarray because of the departure of it star , Jeffrey Tambor , who wa fired after a sexual-harassment investigation . ( He maintained his innocence . ) Ms. Salke had inherited another hit , “ The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel , ” from her predecessor , Roy Price , who wa ousted after a sexual harassment scandal of his own . But she needed to quickly jump-start the rest of Amazon ’ s television business to catch up to a fast-moving Netflix , an insurgent Apple and a Disney-powered Hulu .
 With Amazon ’ s television assembly line in much better shape — Ms. Salke ha made deal with creator like Jordan Peele to bring show to the service — she is now looking more intently at the studio ’ s film operation .
 “ It ’ s not about volume and endless scroll , ” she said , in a clear reference to Netflix , which unfurls roughly 90 original movie annually , including documentary . “ The curated approach is the only way to go for u . Quality over quantity . ”

 Good morning .
 ( Here ’ s the sign-up , if you don ’ t already get California Today by email . )
 The case of Trinity Love Jones , the 9-year-old girl whose body wa found in a duffel bag near a suburban trail in Hacienda Heights , ha transfixed Southern Californians . But a my colleague Jose A. Del Real reported , her death is far from the only such tragedy .
 He talked to parent who are trying to change that :
 When LaWanda Hawkins heard about Trinity Love Jones last week , she thought of her son , Reginald , who wa killed in 1995 at age 19 . She never received any answer about his murder .
 Today , Ms. Hawkins is one of many advocate who belong to an informal network in Southern California dedicated to raising community awareness about young homicide victim . The founder of Justice for Murdered Children , a nonprofit organization , Ms. Hawkins hope public pressure and medium attention will guarantee thorough investigation by law enforcement . More than anything , she want the family to feel supported .
 “ We want the community a a whole to get more involved with these homicide , ” she said . “ We have to hold them accountable . We thought the system would do it for u , but we have to take our own step . ”
 Last week news came that Trinity wa found dead . After a frenzied search for information by the authority , who ruled her death a homicide , Trinity wa identified Sunday night and two people of interest have been detained , according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff ’ s Department .
 “ I ’ m devastated each time , ” Ms. Hawkins said . “ We don ’ t want any more people to join this organization . ”
 In California last year , 49 missing child were found dead , according to the California Department of Justice . About 77,000 child were reported missing in 2018 , of which about 60,000 were located by law enforcement or returned to their family on their own .
 Eliseo Montoya is another advocate who ha helped spread the word about missing child like Trinity . Mr. Montoya ha managed a Facebook group called “ Runaway and Missing Children in California , ” which cull poster of missing child for distribution on social medium . He began the group , he said , after his 15-year-old daughter ran away from home .
 He eventually found his daughter , safe , he said .
 But Mr. Montoya , who wa living in Palmdale at the time , expressed his belief that child from underprivileged neighborhood and minority community — “ kid from the hood , like me ” — rarely command the same urgency a those from more affluent background . Mr. Montoya said that motivated him to continue .
 “ That ’ s basically all my page is , an area for people just to share , ” he said . “ I ’ m a 58-year-old man and this stuff make me cry . I ’ m supposed to be tough and a soldier . So I send a message of prayer and hope , and I tell the parent not to give up . ”
 Ms. Hawkins said she resolved to transform her sense of helplessness into action after her son died .
 “ I started running into too many people who were in the same predicament I wa in , ” she said . “ I will never get over it . ”

 City Lights wa founded by Lawrence Ferlinghetti , who ’ s become San Francisco ’ s de facto poet laureate . He ’ s about to turn 100 this month , so Dwight Garner , a Times book critic , made a pilgrimage of his own to see the cafe and bar where writer like Mr. Ferlinghetti and Allen Ginsberg hung around , ruminated on life and made their art .
 Dwight also visited the man himself , but Mr. Ferlinghetti wasn ’ t too keen to play tour guide . Still , he talked a little about his contemporary , like William S. Burroughs and Bob Dylan , about whom he had this to say : “ Dylan wa first of all a poet . ”
 To which I say , “ Amen . ”

 NAHA , Japan — He ha been called the “ emperor of Japanese architecture ” by his peer and “ visionary ” by critic . Now , the internationally renowned architect Arata Isozaki can add yet another tribute : the 2019 Pritzker Architecture Prize .
 The announcement on Tuesday of architecture ’ s highest award wa seen by many a a long overdue honor for this 87-year-old architect , urban designer and theorist , who is credited with fusing East and West , modern and postmodern , and global and local in a visually diverse body of work that symbolized Japan ’ s global influence . Mr. Isozaki ’ s more than 100 building include the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles , the Palau Sant Jordi in Barcelona and the Qatar National Convention Center in Doha .
 At his modest apartment in Naha , the capital of Okinawa , Mr. Isozaki said he wa “ overjoyed ” to receive the prize .
 [ What to know about the Pritzker Prize . ]
 “ It ’ s like a crown on the tombstone , ” he joked , flashing his trademark sense of humor .
 Dressed in a mud-dyed silk kimono with a folding fan tucked into his obi and his unruly white shoulder-length hair combed back behind his ear , Mr. Isozaki reflected on a six-decade long career blending architecture with visual art , poetry , philosophy , theater , writing and design .
 “ My concept of architecture is that it is invisible , ” he said . “ It ’ s intangible . But I believe it can be felt through the five sens . ”
 Crucial to Mr. Isozaki ’ s avant-garde approach to architecture is the Japanese concept of ma , signifying the merging of time and space , which wa the subject of a traveling exhibition in 1978 .
 “ Like the universe , architecture come out of nothing , becomes something , and eventually becomes nothing again , ” said Mr. Isozaki . “ That life cycle from birth to death is a process that I want to showcase . ”
 His commitment to the “ art of space ” wa in part what led the Pritzker jury to select Mr. Isozaki a it 46th laureate , and the eighth from Japan . He will receive the award at a ceremony in France in May .
 “ Possessing a profound knowledge of architectural history and theory , and embracing the avant-garde , he never merely replicated the status quo , ” said the Pritzker jury in it citation , which also noted Mr. Isozaki ’ s support for young architect . “ But his search for meaningful architecture wa reflected in his building that to this day , defy stylistic categorization , are constantly evolving , and always fresh in their approach . ”
 Born in Oita on the island of Kyushu in 1931 , Mr. Isozaki came of age in a postwar Japan that wa “ in complete ruin , ” with an emperor demoted and social custom in flux .
 “ Air bombardment had destroyed many of the city , building had vanished and there wa only rubble on the ground , ” he wrote . “ However , Japan had already assimilated western modernization by that time . The only possible choice I had wa to start from the ruin — the degree zero where nothing remained . ”
 After graduating from the architecture department at the University of Tokyo in 1954 , Mr. Isozaki apprenticed with Kenzo Tange , the 1987 Pritzker Prize winner known a the father of postwar Japanese architecture .
 Mr. Isozaki ha said that because of the political and economic uncertainty of the period , he “ could not dwell upon a single style. ” As a result , he said : “ Change became constant . Paradoxically , this came to be my own style . ”
 The young architect rode the building wave of postwar Japan , showing the influence of Le Corbusier and Louis I. Kahn a well a that of Mr. Tange in work like the Oita Prefectural Library ( 1962-1966 ) , the Museum of Modern Art in Gunma ( 1971-74 ) and the Kitakyushu Municipal Museum of Art in Fukuoka ( 1972-74 ) .
 It wa during this time that Mr. Isozaki honed his ability to blend architectural style and invent new form by joining simple geometric shape in powerful way , while maintaining an exacting attention to detail and refinement .
 “ Unlike those American postmodernists who believed that classicism held the key to a usable past , Mr. Isozaki appeared to understand that no amount of historical excavation could uncover a firm foundation on which to build the present , ” the critic Herbert Muschamp wrote in The Times in 1993 . “ He perceived that a time that had lost it faith in the future had also lost it grip on the past . ”
 Another constant wa his playful approach to architecture . Seen from above , the cylindrical roof of the Fujimi Country Club ( 1973-74 ) in his hometown , Oita , appears in the shape of a giant question mark , a reflection of Mr. Isozaki ’ s befuddlement with his country ’ s obsession with golf .
 “ The client didn ’ t say a word , ” Mr. Isozaki laughed , a mischievous twinkle in his eye .
 His first overseas commission came in the 1980s when he wa selected to design the Museum of Contemporary Art , Los Angeles , or MOCA , still the architect ’ s best known work in the United States .
 “ At the time , MoMA ” — the Museum of Modern Art in New York — “ wa so popular , I sensed that Los Angeles really wanted to surpass it , ” said Mr. Isozaki . “ So instead of showcasing the artwork in a dark area with artificial light like MoMA did , we destroyed this concept and totally turned it upside down . ”
 Completed in 1986 , the sunken red Indian sandstone-clad museum in downtown Los Angeles feature a barrel-vaulted library and a series of glass pyramid skylight that were intended to let natural light stream down into gallery .
 “ Not since the French architectural visionary of the 18th century ha an architect used solid geometric volume with such clarity and purity , and never with his sense of playfulness , ” the critic Joseph Giovannini wrote of the project in The Times in 1986 .
 The project catapulted Mr. Isozaki onto the international stage , paving the way for a stream of global commission including the Team Disney building in Florida and the China Central Academy of Fine Arts Art Museum in Beijing , and the Sant Jordi stadium ( designed for the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona ) .
 In 2013 , he designed with Anish Kapoor the Ark Nova , an inflatable concert hall that traveled between region affected by the 2011 tsunami in Japan .
 While his best known project are in city , Mr. Isozaki said last week that he wa “ more nostalgic about the rural projects. ” Asked to pick a favorite , he named the Domus Museum ( 1993-1995 ) in A Coruña , Spain . Built atop a rocky outcrop by the Bay of Riazor , the museum feature a curved slate-clad facade that resembles a sail billowing in the wind .
 “ Mr . Isozaki ’ s is an architecture that thrust aside the shopworn debate between modernism and postmodernism , for it is both modern and postmodern , ” the critic Paul Goldberger wrote in The Times in 1986 . “ Modern in it reliance on strong , self-assured abstraction , postmodern in the degree to which it feel connected to the larger stream of history . ”
 In 2017 , Mr. Isozaki donated his vast collection of book and quietly moved with his partner , Misa Shin , from Tokyo to Okinawa in search of warmer clime . The couple rented a nondescript apartment with a view of the sea in a peaceful residential neighborhood . The neighbor have no idea that living in the peach-colored walk-up is a bona fide starchitect .
 Despite having moved to what might be called the “ Florida of Japan , ” Mr. Isozaki said he ha no immediate plan to retire . Recent building boom in the Middle East and Asia — and China , in particular — have allowed the architect to finally realize idea for urban planning that he first conceptualized in his unbuilt project “ City in the Air ” ( 1962 ) , which envisioned a multilayered city hovering above the traditional city . The opportunity were exciting .
 Mr. Isozaki cited a poem he wrote early in his career called “ Incubation Process ” ( 1962 ) , describing it a his first architectural work . The poem wa raw and unrefined , he said , but after 60 year , he still hold onto it essential idea .
 “ Urban planning which doesn ’ t include the idea of destruction , ” the poem read in part , “ should be carried out in nursing home . ”

 Carmen Ejogo leapt in the air and grasped two length of silk , each the color of arterial blood . She took a deep breath , fell back and spun upside-down in the middle of a warehouse in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn .
 “ Whoooo ! ” she yelled , squeezing her leg together to increase her speed .
 Ms. Ejogo , 45 , who play an English teacher with an air of mystery on the new season of HBO ’ s moody police serial , “ True Detective , ” ha a few trick up the sleeve of her Adidas workout top . Here ’ s one : She is a closet circus enthusiast .
 On a break from filming the Netflix thriller “ Rattlesnake , ” Ms. Ejogo had driven to the Muse , a circus training center on a scruffy block just down the street from a hearse rental agency .
 An athlete all through school and a longtime ballet student , Ms. Ejogo love any exercise “ where it start feeling lyrical and more like a dance , ” she said . She stumbled into circus art when a yoga teacher introduced hanging silk into the class . “ It wa immediately captivating to me , ” she said .
 Ms. Ejogo arrived at the Muse at 5 p.m. on a recent Friday , and she stripped down to contemporary athleisure : a black workout top , knit blue legging and jogging short the same color a the silk .
 Alisa Mae , her instructor , arrived a few minute later , in a rose-gold puffer and matching glitter eye shadow . They planned to work on her silk skill and maybe try the lyra , which is a circus apparatus that look like a dangling hula hoop .
 While some roustabout set up for a weekend circus show , Ms. Mae led Ms. Ejogo out to the floor , lit by rickety chandelier and carpeted in purple and blue athletic mat . They warmed up with jumping jack , hamstring kick and shoulder shrug , then moved on to lunge .
 “ Your lunge is so long , ” Ms. Mae said approvingly . “ I love it . ”
 They sat with their knee butterflied and practiced some straddle and split . “ You ’ re really bendy , ” Ms. Mae said .
 “ In some place , ” Ms. Ejogo said .
 Soon , Ms. Mae told Ms. Ejogo to reach for the silk and wrap them around each arm , almost like striping a candy cane . With ferocious concentration , Ms. Ejogo lifted and lowered herself a few time , getting a feel for the silk , while Ms. Mae clocked her upper body strength . “ Let ’ s get upside down and do some fun stuff ! ” Ms. Mae said .
 Ms. Mae then tied the silk together , creating what she called a hammock and settling it near Ms. Ejogo ’ s lower back . Once Ms. Ejogo wa airborne , Ms. Mae gave her leg a shove , sending her into a spin .
 Ms. Ejogo play mostly serious role — it ’ s a choice she made early on , in a bid for career longevity — but in person she is “ quite playful and a little sort of goofy , ” she said . Spinning midair tangled in a scarlet web felt just about right .
 “ Wicked , ” Ms. Ejogo said with broad smile .
 Though Ms. Ejogo usually play American character , she wa born in London , the daughter of a Scottish mother and a Nigerian father . As a teenager , she hosted the child ’ s morning show “ Saturday Disney , ” and then moved to the United States , looking for role that wouldn ’ t typecast her a the “ mixed-race sort of ‘ exotic ’ pretty girl , ” she said .
 While filming the 2001 television movie “ Boycott ” ( she played Coretta Scott King , a role she would reprise in “ Selma ” ) , Ms. Ejogo met the actor Jeffrey Wright . They soon married and had two child , now teenager , who occasionally accompany her to trapeze class on the West Side Highway . She and Mr. Wright divorced in 2014 .
 Now that her child are older , she is working more . She starred in the second season of the Starz drama series “ The Girlfriend Experience , ” playing a high-end escort who reluctantly enters the witness protection program , and ha appeared in both “ Fantastic Beasts ” ( the Harry Potter movie ) a a high-ranking witch .
 She wa hesitant about joining “ True Detective. ” “ I ’ m a parent , and I don ’ t really want to indulge in storytelling that is macabre when it come to child , ” she said . But a she read through the script , she discovered “ something so wonderfully redemptive . ”
 At the Muse , Ms. Ejogo returned to earth and tried a few more pose , including one where she locked the silk around her foot and stood up like a strung bow .
 “ Perfect , ” Ms. Mae said , a Ms. Ejogo untangled herself . “ That wa so easy for you , huh ? ”
 It wa time to try the lyra . “ I ’ m curious about this guy , ” Ms. Ejogo said approaching the ring . Ms. Mae showed her how to grip it with finger and thumb , then pull herself into a little ball and swing her upper body , using the momentum to hook her leg over the ring ’ s edge .
 “ If it doesn ’ t happen right away , don ’ t worry , ” Ms. Mae said . “ Sometimes people get this their first day . Sometimes people get it in about a month . ”
 Ms. Ejogo did not want to wait . She gripped the ring and then , with a little assist from Ms. Mae , her leg were up and over , and she wa swinging from her knee .
 “ You totally did it , ” Ms. Mae said .
 “ That wa a total cheat , ” Ms. Ejogo said .
 “ You still totally did it . ”
 For the first time that evening , Ms. Ejogo looked a little unsure , but Ms. Mae cheered her on . “ You don ’ t need me , ” she said . “ We ’ re just going to go for a spin Point your toe . You ’ re flying . You feel good up there ? ”
 “ I feel great , ” she said .
 They tried one more pose in the lyra : Ms. Ejogo sat in the ring and then scooted onto her side , balancing with her hip . “ It ’ s called man in the moon , ” Ms. Mae said . “ Or person in the moon . ”
 “ So beautiful , so classic , old-school circus , ” Ms. Ejogo said .
 After two more pose , including a fast spin , she dismounted and then , by way of celebration , dove into a ball pit , like the kind at Chuck E. Cheese ’ s . She looked like she wa soaking in a colorful bubble bath .
 “ I love it , ” she said , a the lyra whirled above her . “ I can ’ t ever get out . ”

 MUDURNU , Turkey — Looking for a castle on a cul-de-sac in the Black Sea region of Turkey ?
 You might even be able to get a deal on it .
 The Yerdelen brother , construction entrepreneur from Istanbul riding a real estate boom , had plan to build more than 700 minicastles , with turret and breezy rooftop terrace overlooking the forest , aiming to draw in Arabs from the Gulf country who love to come to Turkey for it lush nature and Mediterranean climate .
 At first , business wa brisk : Half the castle were sold , they said , and building wa going apace . Then oil price slumped , hitting the buyer . Meanwhile , between terrorist attack , a failed coup attempt and what many expert say wa unsustainable borrowing , cronyism and huge public work project with little economic return , Turkey ’ s economy ground to a halt .
 Now , the development is almost at a standstill a the partner work their way through bankruptcy court but are still allowed to trade , their future debated regularly in the news medium .
 Turkey wa feted a the place to invest in the early 2000s , it largest city dubbed “ Cool Istanbul : Europe ’ s Hippest City. ” Under the business-friendly leadership of Recep Tayyip Erdogan , first a mayor of Istanbul , then prime minister and now president , the economy boomed and real estate price soared .
 The country wa busy catching up with Europe in many way . The government introduced mortgage in 2001 and reformed condition for foreign buyer to increase investment in the sector . Rich Arabs and Russians joined European customer lining up to buy summer villa on the Aegean coast and luxury apartment and waterside palace in Istanbul .
 Mr. Erdogan made sure that foreigner could buy property relatively easily and dangled citizenship , if the investment in real estate wa above $ 250,000 . Developers began all manner of scheme to meet the burgeoning demand .
 The Sarot group , run by the Yerdelen brother and their partner , Bulent Yilmaz , decided to move away from their base in Istanbul , where they mostly worked on water and drainage project to develop site around the Roman spa town of Mudurnu in central Turkey , which is famous for it hot spring and healing water .
 The group bought land in several location and began a hotel and spa complex , Harry Potter-style forest cottage and , in a secluded valley out of town , an entire suburb of minicastles , like a full-size Legoland display .
 It wa Mr. Yilmaz who first sketched out the idea on paper .
 “ He drew it , and we made it happen on the ground , ” said Mehmet Emin Yerdelen , 56 , the coordinator of the project .
 For inspiration , they drew on landmark building in Istanbul , the Italianate Galata tower and the medieval Maiden ’ s tower , a well a British and American architecture , said his brother Mezher Yerdelen , 39 , the chief executive officer of the Sarot group ’ s project .
 The result is row of Disney-style chateau , with gray-roofed turret , circular balcony and balustrade , stretching over a million square meter , or 250 acre . A central shopping mall resembles the American Capitol , and lake and garden will link the whole .
 The development straddle the region ’ s hot spring , and each minicastle will have under-floor heating and Jacuzzis on every level , with an option for an indoor pool , the brother promise .
 “ The thermal water can be used for drinking and steam therapy ; it is first class in the world , ” said Mezher Yerdelen . “ You can drink the water , and it cure stomach ailment and kidney stone . If you bathe in it , it heals skin problem , rheumatism and slipped disk . ”
 The company ha done geological survey and already drilled and capped the hot water 200 meter underground . The temperature is 68 degree Celsius , or 154 degree Fahrenheit , and the water is plentiful enough to supply and heat the entire complex , he said .
 Aiming for the Arab market , the partner named the development the Burj al-Babas Thermal Tourism Company and began marketing the house through their real estate agency in Kuwait . They broke ground in 2014 and built quickly , with 2,500 worker , aiming to complete the project in just four year .
 Buyers snapped up more than 350 of the house , which are priced between $ 370,000 and $ 500,000 , depending on location , Mezher Yerdelen said . By last year , half the building were underway .
 Then world event intervened . And the Yerdelen brother , like many other developer , began to feel the fallout .
 “ Our sale dried up , ” Mezher Yerdelen said . Some customer canceled their agreement , some stopped their payment . The company applied for bankruptcy but on appeal won the right to continue trading so they can complete the contracted house .
 Mezher Yerdelen remains optimistic that the real estate market in Turkey will bounce back in 2019 .
 According to figure published by the Association of Real Estate Investment Companies in Turkey , foreign buyer have been returning since 2018 . Roughly a third are from Arab Gulf country .
 On a recent tour , the castle looked like a vision out of a fairy tale under a light covering of snow , but up close they were largely empty shell . Construction wa stopped for the coldest period of the winter and only a few garden have been landscaped .
 The mayor of Mudurnu , Mehmet Inegol , is an energetic supporter of the development and say the construction complies with all regulation . “ Not one single tree wa cut for the development , ” he said . “ In fact the investor chose the valley for it forest . ”
 Critics of the development include Orhan Sarialtun , president of the Chamber of Urban Planners in Ankara , Turkey ’ s capital , who complains that the architecture is not in harmony with Mudurnu ’ s traditional architecture .
 He also object to the concept of such development , saying that the extensive project would inevitably damage the forest and that the sale of secondary holiday home that lie empty much of the year will not benefit the region a much a a hotel project might .
 In the meantime the Yerdelen brother are absorbed in dealing with the demand of the client — all from the Gulf — they have secured so far . All the minicastles are identical on the outside , but client have a choice among three different layout and décor inside .
 An elevator can be installed , a can cupboard in the bedroom , an open-plan kitchen and bathroom on every floor . And the indoor pool is optional .
 Each mansion ha it own garden , but there is little space between the building . Mezher Yerdelen said that most Arab customer already have lived in the United States and the West and are used to living in detached or semidetached housing , in proximity with their neighbor . “ They don ’ t mind , ” he said .
 Some client do want more privacy , and ask to enclose the property , Mehmet Emin Yerdelen said . “ They ask for wall , ” he said , “ but I say no , there will be tree instead. ” He ha planted evergreen shrub to create a natural screen around some of the garden .
 Some buyer remain optimistic about the project . Imad Yousef , a real estate broker in Kuwait , is one of them . “ I hope to make some money , and I will use it myself , ” he said . “ When the project is finished , God willing , it will be amazing . ”
 For the unsold castle the brother hope to develop timeshare agreement and divide them into apartment , with payment in installment . And a the Turkish lira ha fallen , price could fall .
 Some have criticized the architecture and others the extensive development , but the mayor say it will bring much-needed employment . The government ha promised road , rail and air link to the region , including a high-speed train passing through the area and connecting Ankara and Istanbul . The season for visiting Mudurnu run all year , a the hot spring never lose their appeal , Mezher Yerdelen said .
 “ Those today who criticize the architecture , tomorrow they are going to pay to come and see them , ” Mr. Inegol said .

 Richard Plepler , the gregarious chief executive of HBO and one of the most influential executive in entertainment , abruptly stepped down on Thursday . His decision came eight month after AT & T acquired Time Warner , the network ’ s corporate home , in an $ 85.4 billion deal .
 Mr. Plepler found he had le autonomy after the merger , according to two people familiar with his thinking .
 HBO , under his watch , won more than 160 Emmys for series like “ Game of Thrones , ” “ Big Little Lies ” and “ Veep. ” From his office at the network ’ s Manhattan headquarters overlooking Bryant Park , Mr. Plepler , 60 , had a strong hand in creating what is often referred to a television ’ s second golden age . He rose to prominence in a heyday for cable , and HBO ’ s Sunday night lineup showcased critically acclaimed hit like “ The Sopranos , ” “ Sex and the City , ” “ Girls ” and “ Curb Your Enthusiasm . ”
 AT & T ha been in talk with Robert Greenblatt , the former chairman of entertainment at NBC , for a high-level executive post at Warner Media , the division that oversees HBO under it Dallas-based minder . Before he ran programming at NBC , Mr. Greenblatt wa in charge of entertainment at Showtime from 2003 to 2010 , and oversaw show like “ Weeds ” and “ Nurse Jackie. ” After report of the talk surfaced , it seemed unlikely to those who know Mr. Plepler that he would be willing to report to his onetime competitor .
 “ Hard a it is to think about leaving the company I love , and the people I love in it , it is the right time for me to do so , ” Mr. Plepler said in a memo to HBO employee on Thursday . He added , “ I look forward over the coming week to thanking a many of you a I can for the thousand of contribution big and small that have made ‘ this thing of ours , ’ to quote Tony Soprano , so special . ”
 John Stankey , a longtime AT & T executive who became the chief executive of Warner Media last year , said in a statement , “ Richard is one of the most successful executive in our industry and I have been fortunate to have his support over the last month . His vision , energy and passion helped to elevate HBO ’ s brand to what it ha become today . ”
 The combination of Mr. Stankey and Mr. Plepler may have been the stuff of a buddy comedy , but it didn ’ t end with the mismatched duo growing closer in the end . The two executive differ significantly in style and attitude . Mr. Plepler is on the board of the Council on Foreign Relations ; Mr. Stankey is on the board of UPS . Mr. Plepler is at ease working the room at a premiere party ; Mr. Stankey , who recently moved from Dallas to New York , is a self-described “ Bell head , ” a term that refers to his three decade at the telecommunication company , which included a stint at Southwestern Bell .
 The two men started discussing the idea of bringing Mr. Plepler ’ s tenure to an end early in February , according to the two people familiar with the company ’ s plan .
 On Tuesday , the United States Court of Appeals rejected the government ’ s last-ditch attempt to break up the AT & T-Time Warner merger . The Justice Department said it would not appeal , leaving AT & T free to proceed with it plan .
 The industry in which Mr. Plepler thrived ha been destabilized recently by the entry of big-spending digital rival like Netflix and Amazon . Their threat to old way of creating entertainment helped set in motion the recent mega-mergers in medium and entertainment . In addition to AT & T ’ s purchase of Time Warner , the Walt Disney Company is acquiring much of 21st Century Fox .
 Mr. Plepler joined HBO a a public relation official in 1992 , some year after serving a an aide to Christopher J. Dodd , then a United States senator from Connecticut . Before long , Mr. Plepler oversaw HBO ’ s communication department , but his position wa greater than his title suggested . He became the face of HBO ’ s New York operation , playing a key role in programming decision .
 He moved into the role of co-president in 2007 , after the network ’ s chief executive at the time , Chris Albrecht , resigned after being accused of assaulting his girlfriend . Mr. Plepler became chief executive in 2013 and continued to show a knack for picking material that pleased critic while also delivering the occasional cheap thrill .
 During the early stage of AT & T ’ s acquisition of Time Warner , Mr. Plepler strongly suggested that he would not give up his independence during an interview at his usual lunch spot , a corner booth at the Lambs Club , a restaurant two block from his office . In order for HBO to thrive , he insisted , there would have to be “ a Chinese wall ” between the network and it Dallas-based boss . He also wondered aloud why the AT & T chief executive Randall Stephenson would buy HBO if he had any plan that would involve “ messing with a winning game . ”
 Mr. Plepler ’ s future came into clearer focus last June , when AT & T completed it acquisition of Time Warner , which wa also the corporate home of the Warner Bros. movie studio and the cable network CNN , TBS and TNT . Mr. Stankey addressed roughly 150 HBO employee during a town-hall meeting at the cozy HBO Theater on the 15th floor of the company ’ s New York headquarters . He warned them of a “ tough year ” ahead , saying that it “ will feel like childbirth . ”
 Mr. Plepler shared the stage with Mr. Stankey that day , and there wa a moment of public tension between them after the AT & T veteran promised more investment in HBO and Mr. Plepler interjected , “ Let ’ s give him a hand for that simple sentence ! ”
 Reclaiming the stage , Mr. Stankey said , “ We ’ ve got to make money at the end of the day , right ? ”
 “ We do that , ” Mr. Plepler responded .
 “ Yes , you do , ” Mr. Stankey said . “ Just not enough . ”
 There wa laughter in the room , but his blunt statement did not sit well with some employee .
 Profits rose during Mr. Plepler ’ s run a chief executive , topping more than $ 2 billion in 2017 . He introduced a stand-alone app , HBO Now , in 2015 , which ha more than five million subscriber . As someone who had grown accustomed to running his own shop , he seemed to chafe under his new bos from the start . His departure show that AT & T is likely to be an active steward of Warner Media , one that did not hesitate to disrupt a network that is the division ’ s crown jewel .
 Mr. Plepler sent his memo to HBO employee hour before he wa expected to preside over another premiere party — lavish affair were an HBO hallmark during his tenure — for a new documentary , “ The Inventor , ” about the Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes . The director of that film , Alex Gibney , posted his disapproval not long after the news wa public .
 “ Dismaying , ” Mr. Gibney wrote . “ Richard is a great exec , powerful impresario and creative force . Great instinct for story . ”
 Mr. Plepler also hosted dinner party and salon at his Upper East Side apartment and regarded himself a a sort of patron of the auteur . On premiere night and Emmy celebration , he could be found bear-hugging , cajoling and propping up writer , actor and producer , not to mention the magazine editor and columnist he had brought into his fold .
 The talent loved him back , and sometimes even name-checked him in their work . In an episode of “ The Sopranos , ” Tony Soprano , after getting shot , is overseen by a doctor whom the show ’ s creator , David Chase , named Dr. Lior Plepler . Likewise , Larry David ’ s character in the HBO movie “ Clear History ” invokes the name when referring to an expensive painting on his wall .
 “ It ’ s a Plepler ! ” he say .

 Political bombshell : Over the weekend , Mr. Netanyahu pledged that , if re-elected , he would extend Israel ’ s sovereignty over the West Bank , an apparent last-ditch attempt to woo right-wing voter .
 The West Bank is home to 2.6 million Palestinians . If Mr. Netanyahu carried out his promise , it could end any possibility of a two-state solution .
 Iran : In a move that could give Mr. Netanyahu a boost , President Trump designated an arm of the Iranian military — the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps — a a foreign terrorist organization , the first time the U.S. ha made such a declaration about part of a government .

 Lately , legging have become a cultural lightning rod . But a new retrospective of the British designer Mary Quant reminds u of an earlier fashion flash point : the miniskirt revolution .
 Ms. Quant , a trailblazer of Swinging Sixties fashion , famously said she “ didn ’ t have time to wait for woman ’ s lib. ” Her higher-than-high hemline insisted on young woman ’ s right to bare their leg .
 She named her trademark skirt after her favorite car , the original Mini Cooper .
 Pieces of clothing resembling miniskirt have been identified by archaeologist a far back a the 1300s B.C. , but it wasn ’ t until the mid-20th century that the mini really took off . Staying true to the Hemline Index ( whereby skirt hemline rise along with stock price ) , the miniskirt perfectly captured 1960s London . The trend ha followed a boom-and-bust cycle ever since .
 Bans on short skirt are enforced in several African country , however , and wearing a mini can prompt outrage — and even criminal arrest — in part of the Middle East .
 That ’ s it for this briefing . And today , take some inspiration from “ Dumbo ” : Don ’ t just fly , soar .

 The store in Seattle ha more than 132,000 title , many of them not available on the internet , or anywhere else . “ We will fight to the death to keep this open . ”
 By Laura M. Holson

 There is a story Russell Williams like to tell about his favorite video store . It wa the mid-1990s , and Mr. Williams , a Seattle computer game executive , wa searching for a place to rent vintage film . He wa thrilled to find a store called Taboo , then realized it offered only adult movie . He sniffed at the local Blockbuster , which mainly stocked mainstream fare . One day , he passed a small storefront plastered with brightly lit poster . His curiosity wa piqued .
 He had stumbled upon Scarecrow , a video emporium founded by a Greek immigrant named George Latsios , who had amassed a collection of cultural ephemera and hard-to-find film .
 Inside , Mr. Williams found VHS cassette tape of Yoko Ono and John Lennon when they were co-hosts on “ The Mike Douglas Show ” in 1972 . He found a 1907 silent film adaptation of Jules Verne ’ s “ Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. ” And he also came across a 1953 copy of “ The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T , ” the only live-action fantasy film written by Dr. Seuss . ( Yes , that Dr . Seuss . )
 “ It began my love affair with Scarecrow , ” Mr. Williams said in a recent interview . So much so that his wife tease when he stop there on his way home from work . “ I go in , and I ’ m there for two hour , ” he said . “ It ’ s like spelunking . You find treasure after treasure . ”
 Consider Quentin Tarantino , who learned movie history a a video store clerk himself in the 1980s . Once video store were the only place cinephiles could find favorite film after they left theater . Then came the internet . The rise of online streaming service wa a convenience for movie lover , but it spelled , too , the end of an era . Last month , Blockbuster , which used to operate 9,000 store , announced that only one remained , in Bend , Ore .
 As for Scarecrow , it survived bankruptcy , the threat of closing and the death of it charismatic founder . In 2014 , it became a nonprofit . And now , after 30 year , with more than 132,000 title — many on VHS , laser disc and DVD — it is a much a cultural warehouse a anything else .
 And that give Kate Barr , Scarecrow ’ s president , pause . Film lover today have access to a prescribed number of movie on streaming service like Netflix , Amazon and Hulu , and other niche channel . Old treasure — many of which are unavailable online because of right issue or technological hurdle — are being locked away , forgotten or even destroyed .
 Of Scarecrow , Ms. Barr said , “ We will fight to the death to keep this open . ”
 Sure , most people no longer want to trudge to the video store on a Friday night , a they once did in drove . Streaming movie are available through on-demand cable , Amazon , Apple , Netflix and many other source . But the emphasis tends to be on current title , or TV series . Netflix , which pioneered renting DVDs by mail and streaming , ha been moving steadily into original programming , for example .
 Ms. Barr worry that a dearth of vintage movie mean voice from earlier generation won ’ t be heard . She point to hard-to-find documentary and little-known gem by black or gay writer and director . “ Who is making decision about what title get seen ? ” she asked . “ I think it is important to not lose sight of the importance of movie . They reflect culture . They are cinematic history . It is important to keep these document . ”
 At first , Scarecrow wa fueled by the passion of one man : Mr. Latsios . He learned English in Greece by watching American movie , his ex-wife , Rebecca Soriano , said . Starting a a teenager , he gathered a collection of 400 videotape . In 1983 , Mr. Latsios moved to Seattle and began renting them out at the back of a friend ’ s store .
 A few year later , he had his own shop : Scarecrow officially opened on Dec. 8 , 1988 , in a small storefront next to a pub . “ Our first day we made $ 30 , so we went and bought drink , ” Ms. Soriano said .
 Mr. Latsios worked two job to pay rent and build the collection . He traveled to Europe and acquired Italian horror movie and work by French auteur . He went to Tokyo , Ms. Soriano said , and came back with crate of Japanese animation on laser disc .
 Ms. Barr said Mr. Latsios found copy of movie not available in America . One wa “ Song of the South , ” a 1946 Walt Disney film condemned for it racial stereotyping of African-Americans after the Civil War . It wa never released on video in the United States .
 Success eluded Mr. Latsios until the mid-1990s , when word of his collection spread to Hollywood and beyond . By then , he owned ten of thousand of video , including a rare 1968 copy of “ Savage Seven , ” an outlaw biker movie featuring the director Penny Marshall in her first movie role .
 “ That ’ s when we became a destination for people who couldn ’ t find stuff , ” Ms. Soriano said .
 Quentin Tarantino showed up , she said . Roger Ebert , the movie critic who died in 2013 , wa a frequent visitor . “ He would wait on people in the store , ” Ms. Soriano said . “ He would walk through the aisle , grab cassette and tell people , ‘ Don ’ t leave without getting this ! ’ ”
 In 1995 , Mr. Latsios learned he had brain cancer and began buying every movie he could get his hand on . Soon after , the Internal Revenue Service came calling . Ms. Soriano said her ex-husband had spent the money set aside for payroll and other tax on video , leaving the store more than $ 500,000 in debt .
 “ Everyone wa mad , ” she said . “ I wa mad . The employee were mad . No one knew if the I.R.S . wa going to walk through the door and take everything . Still , here , we had this historic collection of movie . ”
 His buying spree wa too much for the store to bear , and in 1998 , Scarecrow filed for bankruptcy . By then , Mr. Williams had befriended Mr. Latsios . He and a group of friend guaranteed Scarecrow ’ s $ 55,000 lease until a new buyer could be found . Scarecrow wa sold to investor a year later , and ultimately ended up in the hand of Carl Tostevin and Mickey McDonough .
 After the sale , Mr. Latsios and Ms. Soriano divorced . He moved back to Greece , where he died in 2003 .
 “ He wanted Scarecrow to be a monument to his life , ” Mr. Williams said .
 Scarecrow ’ s money woe , though , persisted , fueled by the decline in home video rental . “ Convenience and price ha trumped an experience which wa generally considered pleasurable , ” said Daniel Herbert , a medium professor at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and author of “ Videoland : Movie Culture at the American Video Store . ”
 In October 2013 , Mr. Tostevin and Ms. McDonough posted a public letter to customer asking for help . Video rental , they said , were down 40 percent in the last six year . If the store were to thrive , customer needed to rent more movie .
 “ Scarecrow ha never been about making money , but it ha to support itself , ” they wrote . “ It ’ s no longer doing that , and hasn ’ t for a while . ”
 Rentals jumped the next month , Ms. Barr said , then plummeted . Four month later , she and more than two dozen Scarecrow staff member met with the owner to discus their fate . Mr. Tostevin and Ms. McDonough told them they were seeking a buyer . They , too , considered whether to donate the asset to someone who would keep the collection together and run it a a nonprofit . Were the employee interested ? They were . In mid-2014 , they took over management . Mr. Herbert , a supporter , joined the nonprofit ’ s board .
 Running Scarecrow , Ms. Barr said , is harder than she imagined . The store ha added community event to attract new customer , sought donation and offered perk to member , including renting out video player . But the Hollywood filmmaker who used to venture north have not come to the rescue .
 “ It ’ s odd , ” Ms. Barr said . “ But filmmaker and people in the film industry are far le invested in what happens after a film is completed . They make the film and they are done . They move on . ”

 SLEEPING WITH STRANGERS How the Movies Shaped Desire By David Thomson
 Who doesn ’ t love movie ? When my mother wa gravely ill , there wa nothing she wanted more than to watch the screener of new film I brought her or old one I rented for her . I , in turn , still remember the first movie I ever saw : an early Disney feature called “ Third Man on the Mountain ” ( when I checked it out on Google the entry lined up with my memory of the film ) . I wa all of 5 year old at the time , and TV watching , which wa still a black-and-white phenomenon , wasn ’ t much of a thing in my family , so the whole experience of sitting in a darkened theater , waiting for the big screen to flicker into life , inspired a kind of awe .
 The sheer frisson that come with moviegoing still remains with me — and , I would wager , still exists for a lot of people , even those jaded by watching video on their cellphone . Although there are any number of people who wrote and write well about film , including Robert Warshow , Richard Schickel , John Simon and Molly Haskell , the sense of primal excitement I am alluding to can be felt in the writing of only a few movie critic . I have in mind particularly the Scottish novelist and screenwriter Gilbert Adair , whose film criticism for The Independent wa both witty ( he wa fond of pun ) and profound ; Pauline Kael , whose passion for film wa palpable however wildly she often struck ; and David Thomson , the British-born cinephile whose “ Biographical Dictionary of Film ” ( now in it sixth edition ) is one of the most trenchant and eccentric reference work ever conceived .
 Thomson ’ s supremely literate and maverick sensibility ha informed 20-odd book over five decade , ranging from novel ( “ Suspects ” ) and biography ( David Selznick , the Warner brother ) to overwrought ode to actor ( “ Nicole Kidman ” ) and history of Hollywood ( “ Beneath Mulholland : Thoughts on Hollywood and Its Ghosts , ” “ The Big Screen ” ) . He ha also published book , like “ Warren Beatty and Desert Eyes ” and “ Rosebud : The Story of Orson Welles , ” that don ’ t fit any known category but are intriguingly hybrid effort that take off from a specific film to expound on the mystique of personality and the mystery of successful ( or , a it may be , failed ) moviemaking .
 His latest book , “ Sleeping With Strangers , ” is an argument — or several argument — wrapped in a film history wrapped in a memoir . In the wide range of his reference and the casual pointillism of his style , Thomson occupies a singular perch ; I can ’ t think of another critic on this subject who would refer to the poet Gerard Manley Hopkins ’ s use of “ sprung rhythm ” or compare “ American Gigolo ” to “ hot butterscotch on vanilla bean ice cream. ” Whether the book work a a whole ( I ’ m not sure it doe ) seems to me le important than the part that sum it up , which in Thomson ’ s case contain more original insight , provocative aside and thought-inducing speculation than several volume of a le talented writer ’ s effort .
 Already with the first sentence of “ Sleeping With Strangers , ” Thomson establishes himself a an independent mind , positing a definition of moviegoing that complicates the by-now tired idea of film a an inherently voyeuristic genre : “ The movie screen is a window , and the trick of the medium is to let u feel we can pas through it. ” We first watch , in other word , and then we connect so intensely that the frame fall away and we are part of the picture instead of outside it . It is an expansive definition , one that upends the whole notion of film a predominantly catering to the infamous “ male gaze ” beloved of feminist film critic ( although Thomson later on dutifully devotes an entire chapter to this very trope ) , suggesting instead that it intention and it reach are larger and more inclusive .
 If there is a consistent theme to this book , it is that the erotic life of movie shape and misshapes u , codifying our fantasy , shooting an arrow into them and occasionally showing them up a bogus . Beginning with his early infatuation with “ Bonnie and Clyde , ” which Thomson tell u he saw “ five time in a week in 1967 , ” he vaguely intuits , together with a fellow enthusiast , “ how cinema turned on a level of desire that could never quite be fulfilled . We gazed at the screen with longing , but we could never get there. ” From here he go on to explore the subtext of eros — of desire in general but also the specific of homosexual desire — that play out under the putatively heteronormative universe of the silver screen . To this end he is single-minded , even fanatic , about ferreting out closeted gayness in both straight-seeming actor ( Burt Lancaster , Katharine Hepburn ) and character ( Clyde Barrow in “ Bonnie and Clyde , ” Johnnie Aysgarth in “ Suspicion ” ) , a well a straight-seeming narrative ( “ Sweet Smell of Success , ” “ Gilda ” ) — so much so that at some point he reminded me of the gay writer Paul Monette , whom I used to sun with at the Beverly Hills Hotel when I wa editing his memoir “ Borrowed Time ” and who used to insist that every actor — or , indeed , man — I could think of wa gay , including Henry Kissinger . Thomson also spends a lot of time ( too much for my liking ) on the enigma of Cary Grant ’ s sexual orientation , although this is hardly news . Before the recent documentary about and memoir by Scotty Bowers ( also known a “ pimp to the star ” ) , there wa a 1989 biography of Grant , written by Charles Higham and Roy Moseley , that proceeded from the premise that the charismatic leading man wa at the very least bisexual .
 Despite this focus , Thomson ’ s thesis , by his own admission , go farther than merely compiling “ a list of gay career ” or “ outing ” people : “ Rather , ” he writes , “ I want to extend the proposal that the atmosphere of all movie had a gay air. ” He is referring specifically to film of the 1930s made in the wake of the Production Code , but in truth he sprinkle hint throughout the book that he considers the medium of cinema conducive to the subversion of smug heterosexual piety . Referring to the director George Cukor and other gay film people “ who prospered naturally for decade in Hollywood , ” Thomson observes : “ They intuited that the medium wa detached or ironic about life ’ s conventional ideal and heavenly marriage . The medium understood transience and promiscuity — the alleged liberty that straight sometimes envied in gay life . ”
 In the end , though , “ Sleeping With Strangers ” is larger than any of it hypothesis about “ the unease of straight manhood , ” or it obvious point ( “ Porn is full of male hatred of woman ” ) — or , again , it sweeping statement , replete with slightly smarmy wordplay , such a : “ Many womanizer leave woman dissatisfied . They tend to come in their own minds. ” Thomson is set on linking our frenetic carnality on screen to our vexed carnality in real life , and in doing so he elucidates the cultural impact of film on the shadowy area of our collective psyche — whether it be gender , racial politics or the male pursuit of power — with an unflinching , sardonic eye . He invokes everyone from Tarzan to Trump and everything from “ Last Tango in Paris ” to # MeToo . If it is true that he sometimes substitute free association for deep thinking and throw out aperçus just to see if they ’ ll stick , it is also true that “ Sleeping With Strangers ” is dazzling in the effrontery of it opinion , even when they don ’ t quite hold up . Thomson , a stylist extraordinaire , ha written an unaccountable and irresistible book . He reminds u that in a world of increasing sham , movie have the virtue of being instructive , occasionally enlightening sham — to embrace or ignore , a the case may be , but always full of bright dream , dark vision and glittering possibility .
 Daphne Merkin , the author of “ This Close to Happy : A Reckoning With Depression , ” ha written frequently about film .

 A herd of technology public offering this year and next year is set to anoint venture capital winner . Here are some of them .
 By Erin Griffith
 Brian Chesky , chief executive of Airbnb , like to tell the story of his early struggle to fund his home-sharing start-up . Many venture capitalist refused to meet with him , he said in an email . Some walked out in the middle of meeting .
 That changed after venture firm such a Sequoia Capital , Andreessen Horowitz and Founders Fund decided to gamble on Airbnb ’ s potential to shake up the vacation rental business .
 Three investor at those firm — Alfred Lin of Sequoia , Jeff Jordan at Andreessen Horowitz and Brian Singerman of Founders Fund — are now among the top player in the venture capital industry , according to an annual ranking compiled for The New York Times by CB Insights , which track the start-up industry . Airbnb , privately valued at $ 31 billion , landed more venture investor at the top of the list than any other company .
 In his email , Mr. Chesky said Mr. Lin , Mr. Jordan and Mr. Singerman “ have a founder ’ s mind-set ” and “ share our long-term vision . ”
 Airbnb is expected to go public sometime in the next year , following a bumper crop of initial public offering that began on Friday with the ride-hailing company Lyft . Uber , Pinterest , Slack and others are also expected to list their share in the next few month .
 These offering will likely mint many venture capital winner , generating huge return for those who wrote the early check to these company . Here ’ s a look at some of the venture investor who may reap the I.P.O . reward .
 When Uber go public , Mr. Lin may feel a sting . That ’ s because he made a small personal investment in the ride-hailing company when it wa very young , but turned down numerous chance to invest on behalf of Sequoia a Uber grew into a behemoth .
 “ We just didn ’ t dream with the entrepreneur , ” said Mr. Lin , 46 , who joined Sequoia in 2010 . “ Sometimes we just make the wrong call . ”
 He may have other opportunity to celebrate . Mr. Lin and Sequoia invested early in Airbnb ; DoorDash , a food delivery start-up valued at $ 7.1 billion ; and Houzz , a home design and remodeling start-up worth $ 4 billion .
 Sequoia wrote Airbnb a $ 585,000 check in 2009 and invested in each of the company ’ s later funding round . Mr. Lin said he wa impressed by how the Airbnb founder could “ articulate a dream of the world that is very different from what exists today . ”
 Yet sometimes those lofty dream clashed with reality . As Airbnb grew , Mr. Chesky said , he wanted to hire executive from Apple and Disney , company he admired for their creativity , design and simple product line .
 Mr. Lin , a former executive at Amazon-owned Zappos , said he had gently suggested that Airbnb emulate business that looked more like itself : one with complex operation in many different place and a wide array of inventory , like Airbnb ’ s million of home listing .
 To help make the point , Mr. Lin introduced Mr. Chesky to Jeff Wilke , the head of Amazon ’ s retail business , in 2012 . That meeting persuaded Mr. Chesky to shift his focus . Airbnb ended up poaching top Amazon executive to become it chief financial officer and head of it home business .
 “ Part of our job is to help with the sparring of idea , ” Mr. Lin said .
 With the I.P.O . stampede now on , he said , he is cautioning company not to rush to go public because their peer are doing so . “ These thing are milestone , to some degree , that you celebrate , ” he said . “ But soon after you go public , you have to go back to running your business . ”
 What ’ s next ? Mr. Lin said he and his team were looking at everything from robotics and artificial intelligence to payment and short-form video .
 Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz , the founder of Andreessen Horowitz , have long been fixture in the top ranking of venture capital investor , thanks to investment in company like Lyft . Mr. Jordan , their partner , ha recently outdone them .
 Mr. Jordan , 60 , got behind company such a Pinterest , the digital pin board , which recently filed it prospectus for going public . He also bet on Instacart , the grocery delivery company worth $ 7.6 billion , and Lime , a scooter start-up valued at $ 2.4 billion .
 In 2011 , Mr. Jordan also led Andreessen Horowitz ’ s $ 60 million investment in Airbnb . He ha said the company ’ s “ marketplace ” model of matching traveler with home provider reminded him of the early day of eBay , where he wa an executive for five year .
 When Airbnb experienced a hiccup in 2011 — a host ’ s home wa trashed by a guest — Mr. Jordan helped the company with a new insurance program , Airbnb Guarantee , which wa modeled after one at eBay .
 Mr. Jordan , who also led OpenTable before joining Andreessen Horowitz in 2011 , said part of his investment success wa due to the firm ’ s wide range of service for start-ups , including recruiting , public relation and business development . It wa once unusual for venture firm to to provide those service , though they have become more common .
 Apoorva Mehta , founder and chief executive of Instacart , said Mr. Jordan often provided corporate development advice and introduction to potential retail partner .
 “ Jeff ha always felt like an extension of our team , ” Mr. Mehta said .
 Mr. Jordan , who declined to comment on the current wave of I.P.O.s , said he wa looking for the next “ platform , ” which could be voice or augmented reality and virtual reality .
 Founders Fund doe not offer a suite of service to it start-ups . That ’ s in keeping with the contrarian philosophy of it founder , Peter Thiel .
 “ We ’ re not operating the company , ” Mr. Singerman , a partner at the firm , said of the reason for not providing additional service . He added that he also eschewed the typical venture capital practice of investing in company based on a specific strategy or thesis .
 “ That is not me , ” he said . “ I ’ m actually open to anything . “
 All of this help explain why Mr. Singerman , a 42-year-old former Google engineer , ha backed company a diverse a a health insurance start-up , a payment company , a cancer drug maker and a seller of cheap novelty gift . And , of course , Airbnb .
 When Founders Fund helped fund Airbnb in 2013 , it international growth had begun taking off .
 “ We had never seen an international network effect like they had , ” Mr. Singerman said . He said Mr. Chesky also had a strong sense of what his customer wanted and “ kind of will thing into existence . ”
 Mr. Singerman , who joined Founders Fund in 2008 , said his biggest challenge wa finding the right company and persuading the founder to let him invest . To source deal , he relies on a broad network of contact , which led him to Stemcentrx , a cancer drug company that wa sold to AbbVie in 2016 for $ 5.8 billion , and RigUp , an online job platform for energy industry worker .
 There ’ s one area in which Mr. Singerman is like other venture capitalist : his professed nonchalance toward I.P.O.s . Founders Fund tends to hold stock in it investment “ for a very , very long time , ” so a company ’ s public offering “ doesn ’ t impact u , ” he said .
 In 2016 , Mr. Singerman invested in a company called Long Term Stock Exchange . Founded by Eric Ries , the author of the start-up bible “ The Lean Startup , ” the company want to open a new stock exchange for young company that are seeking investor who will stick around for the long haul .
 Mr. Ries said he had gone to Mr. Singerman for funding because he knew his idea wa “ out on a limb ” and would require patience from investor .
 CB Insights analyzed investor ’ deal , including company that sold or went public and the value of current portfolio company , to rank the top venture capitalist . The analysis spanned 2010 through March 2019 and is weighted toward more recent performance . The Times present the top 20 here :
 1 . Neil Shen — Sequoia Capital China
 2 . Lee Fixel — Tiger Global Management
 3 . Bill Gurley — Benchmark
 4 . Alfred Lin — Sequoia Capital

 The investment in Big Zodiac seems … preordained .
 By Erin Griffith
 As an Aquarius , David Birnbaum is naturally skeptical of astrology . But a an investor , he ha zero doubt about the business potential of the $ 2.1 billion “ mystical service market. ” It ’ s an area that he ha been trying , unsuccessfully , to invest in for nearly two decade .
 Mr. Birnbaum researched lot of astrology start-ups in the Web 1.0 era but concluded then that they were not good investment . “ They were pretty much just marketplace sending traffic off to random astrologer , ” he said . “ They were definitely shady . ”
 This year he finally backed one : Sanctuary , an app that can be described a “ Uber for astrological readings. ” For $ 19.99 a month , you can receive a monthly one-on-one chat consultation with an astrologer . ( The app also provides free daily horoscope . )
 Mr. Birnbaum ’ s decision to back a horoscope company through Five Four Ventures , the incubator he run , “ get a lot of grin ” from people in the finance world , he said . But they get it . Astrology is having a cultural moment , and for investor , that translates to dollar sign .
 In recent year astrology traded it psychedelic new-wave stigma for modern Instagrammy witch vibe , and those vibe are very popular with millennial woman . This mean there ’ s money to be made . Start-ups — professional , non-shady one with interesting business model — are bubbling up , eagerly raising funding from people like Mr. Birnbaum .
 A few week after Sanctuary became available for download , Co-Star , an app that let people download and compare their birth chart , raised just over $ 5 million in funding from the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Maveron and Aspect Ventures , a well a 14W , based in New York . Co-Star ’ s website promotes the fact that astrology allows “ irrationality to invade our techno-rationalist way of living. ” The app ha been downloaded more than three million time . Its Instagram account ha more than 400,000 follower .
 Banu Guler , the chief executive and co-founder of Co-Star , said not every investor she pitched wa enthusiastic about her company and that some dismissed it practice area a pseudoscience . “ I get that you ’ re not into astrology , ” she said , “ but if you had access to a 20-something or teenager who is a girl , that ’ s who you need to talk to . ”
 A third app called Pattern is spreading among finance and Hollywood type ; it is founded by Lisa Donovan , the co-founder of Maker Studios , which sold to Disney for $ 675 million . Ms. Donovan said she hasn ’ t raised a formal round of outside funding yet .
 Ms. Guler , a Scorpio with Cancer rising and moon in Leo , belief Co-Star can be “ really big. ” Bigger than the dozen of horoscope blog or online shop selling crystal and tarot card . Maybe even bigger than meditation apps , one of which wa recently valued at $ 1 billion by investor .
 Meditation , Ms. Guler said , is an antisocial way of interacting with the world . She view astrology a a form of collective wellness , with Co-Star helping people relate to each other based on star sign . Another big difference between astrology and meditation ’ s practitioner : Astrologers are not allergic to making money .
 Co-Star is free , but user can pay $ 2.99 to compare their chart to that of a friend who isn ’ t a member . This is where the relating come in . They can answer question like , “ Why did we get into that insane fight and why did you shut down ? ” Ms. Guler said . “ Is it because you ’ re a Capricorn Mars ? Maybe . So let ’ s talk about it . ”
 Anarghya Vardhana , a partner at Maveron and a Libra , said Co-Star ha the potential to be a big a Spotify , the music streaming app worth $ 24 billion , or Tinder , the ubiquitous dating app owned by Match Group .
 “ It probably ha this aura of being unscientific or whatever , ” Ms. Vardhana said . But Ms. Guler “ did a really good job of understanding all of that and rooting it in a much science a possible. ” Co-Star promotes it use of artificial intelligence and data from NASA to track movement of the star .

 Ms. Guler emailed a university psychology program asking if they ’ d take M.R.I . scan of people while using the app to learn about how people are reacting to it . She got no response . “ Having money will help with that , ” she said .
 The casual observer might attribute astrology ’ s surging popularity to the stereotype of the narcissistic millennial . Of course the selfie-loving nanoinfluencer generation is eager to hear that they ’ re unique and special , no matter how woo-woo it seems . Horoscopes are a more personalized version of BuzzFeed-style identity content that ’ s designed to be relatable and shareable : “ 17 Things That Only People Named Jennifer Will Understand ” or “ 28 Signs You Were Raised By Persian Parents In America . ”
 “ What ’ s better than something that is basically a story about you ? ” Mr. Birnbaum said .
 But that explanation ignores what many in the astro-verse consider the major turning point for Big Zodiac : The election of Donald Trump . It changed everything , according to Aliza Kelly , the astrologer-in-residence at Sanctuary . ( She writes it horoscope and conduct some of it reading . ) Watching The New York Times ’ s forecast needle tip from Hillary Clinton to Mr. Trump raised people ’ s doubt about certain scientifically proven system , Ms. Kelly said . “ People became so much more receptive to the idea of there being different way of seeing the world , ” she said . They turned to astrology “ in order to create some sense of structure and hope and stability in their life . ”
 President Trump ’ s election inspired Ms. Guler to leave her work in fashion medium and create Co-Star . “ I wa like , ‘ We got ta figure out something more meaningful than what we are doing , ” she said . The role social medium played in the election — and how “ it is changing how we operate a human in the world ” wa a part of her concern , Ms. Guler said .
 Investors see other trend feeding into astrology ’ s resurgence , Ms. Vardhana said . People are seeking smaller , specialized community online , while participation in organized religion is declining . Millennials ( and the rest of u ) are lonely and want community , no matter how many follower we have on social medium . Why wouldn ’ t we turn to the star and moon and planet and house of the horoscope ?
 “ This is a phenomenon and maybe astrology and the technology of Co-Star is well equipped to address it , ” Ms. Vardhana said . The challenge , she said , will be converting more mainstream skeptic without “ alienating the astro-nerds . ”
 A few minute into my reading on Sanctuary ’ s app , Ms. Kelly , my on-demand astrologer , asked me if her assessment of my birth chart rang true . According to her interpretation , last year wa a very important year for me to redefine my value . As a Libra rising , my relationship are very important to me , she noted . And in the next few week , I should put myself out in the world to make connection : ) .
 “ Sure ! ” I typed into the app . It wa just vague enough that if I did a little mental backbend , I could find example to support her conclusion . I felt hesitant to share anything too personal about myself with a stranger until I remembered that by entering the date , city and precise time of day I wa born , I had already bared my soul , astrologically speaking .
 Sanctuary ’ s in-app reading are bite-size , designed to answer a specific question or dilemma . Sometimes , Ms. Kelly said in an interview , you just want to know why someone is being a jerk , “ or how you can best navigate that dynamic . You don ’ t need to talk about ancestral trauma . ”
 Ross Clark , Sanctuary ’ s chief executive , co-founder and a Leo , estimate that there are 100,000 self-employed astrologer in the country . Sanctuary is starting with around 30 , who Ms. Kelly and the Sanctuary team ha helped vet and train on the company ’ s reading system . He emphasized the app ’ s live one-on-one connection . “ We ’ re not trying to be some sort of spiritual Alexa , where we ’ re using AI to replace someone , ” he said . “ If you think about the practice , it ’ s really emotional . ”
 The apps create a shortcut to intimacy . Armed with purported knowledge of your peer ’ personality , conversation can skip over the polite get-to-know-you small talk and dive right into the ancestral trauma . In that way it doesn ’ t even matter that the science is actually fake . It creates a self-fulfilling prophecy where perceived intimacy lead to real intimacy . Later , when I interviewed Ms. Kelly , she mentioned that this wa a good story for me , a Pisces , to be doing .
 Why ? Because , she said , Pisces are spiritual healer and emotional philosopher . “ The quest for spiritual awakening and enlightenment is what Pisces energy is all about , ” she said . “ It ’ s in your blood . ”
 It felt like a convenient conclusion , given her company ’ s interest in getting me to write a story . Then again , who wa I to argue with the star ? With my blood ? It felt absurd , but also just satisfying and amusing enough that I did not reject the suggestion . Instead , I said , “ Sure ! ”

 A Green Real Deal will put the president on the defensive in the next election .
 By Thomas L. Friedman
 Opinion Columnist
 Here ’ s some news you may have missed . Southeastern Africa got hit in March with a cyclone that United Nations official say wa one of the worst weather disaster to ever strike the Southern Hemisphere . “ Ever ” is a long time .
 The storm swept through Mozambique , Malawi and Zimbabwe , killing hundred . My friend Greg Carr , who run the Gorongosa National Park in Mozambique , told me that the lion , elephant and zebra sensed the storm coming and moved to higher ground to avoid the flooding . Among the people and bird that survived , many of the former lost their home and the latter their nest and egg .
 While this historic weather disaster wa unfolding , President Trump wa urging Republicans not to kill the Democrats ’ Green New Deal proposal — not because Trump want to work with it , but because he want to run against it in 2020 .
 Trump want to take the Green New Deal , co-sponsored by Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of the Bronx , and mock it aspiration to urgently decarbonize our electric grid , transportation sector , industry and building , while pairing all that with program to ensure that every American can get a job and have access to health care and “ safe , affordable , adequate housing , ” a well a other social good .
 AOC ’ s rejoinder : “ For everyone who want to make a joke about that , you may laugh , but your grandkids will not . ”
 She is right . And given the choice between a “ Green New Deal ” that envisions scaling justice for all and Trump ’ s “ Black New Deal , ” which protects profitable pollution for the 1 percent , my heart is with the green . But my head say you can ’ t transform our energy system and our social/economic one at scale all at once . We have to prioritize energy/climate . Because for the environment , later will be too late . Later is officially over .
 And if Democrats approach this right — with a barrage of political ad paired with a focused green strategy , like the “ Green Real Deal ” proposed by Ernie Moniz , Barack Obama ’ s energy secretary , and Andy Karsner , George W. Bush ’ s assistant energy secretary for renewable energy — they can win on this issue in 2020 and make Trump the laughingstock .
 Here are the kind of political ad I ’ d run :
 The Department of Energy ’ s 2017 U.S. Energy and Employment Report revealed that solar energy wa employing more worker than the traditional coal , gas and oil industry combined . But Trump say he prefers big , beautiful coal . How do your kid feel about that ?
 The heartland of America ’ s wind energy system today is Texas , Oklahoma , Kansas , Wyoming , North Dakota and Iowa , which all voted for Trump in 2016 . But Trump say noise from wind turbine “ cause cancer. ” Do you buy that ?
 Cyclone Idai devastated some of the greatest wilderness area in Africa . Trump couldn ’ t care le . Do you ? Because another decade of storm like that , and the only lion , elephant and zebra your grandkids will ever see will be in a Disney movie .
 Newsweek just reported that a study published in the journal Nature found that the replenishment of new coral in Australia ’ s Great Barrier Reef , one of the true natural wonder on our planet , “ fell by a staggering 89 percent following two severe mass bleaching event in 2016 and 2017 , which were caused by significant spike in water temperature . The two bleaching event were the worst in recorded history , leading to a catastrophic die-off in many region of the 3,800 individual reef that comprise the world ’ s largest reef system. ” Your grandkids may never see a real coral reef . Trump couldn ’ t care le . Do you ?
 I ’ d pound Trump with these point , but they will be effective only if married to a “ Green Real Deal. ” For Moniz and Karsner , that would involve every state or city adopting it own version of a plan California approved last year called S.B . 100 .
 S.B . 100 , which wa spearheaded by State Senator Kevin de León , an unsung hero of the green movement , mandated that power company steadily increase carbon-free electricity on their grid until it reach 100 percent by 2045 .
 As David Roberts wrote for Vox , de León kept “ the bill simple and direct enough to command broad support . … Somehow , everyone saw themselves in S.B . 100 . Labor and business , nuke and renewables , market and mandate , cat and dog — somehow the bill hit the sweet spot . It contained enough substance to matter , but not so many bell and whistle that everyone found something to hate . ”
 The law set a steadily rising standard for California power generation company : 50 percent renewables by 2026 , 60 percent renewables by 2030 and 100 percent carbon-free — so a to include energy source that aren ’ t actually renewable , but don ’ t emit carbon dioxide— — by 2045 . So wind , solar , geothermal , biomass , large hydro , nuclear power and natural gas paired with carbon capture and storage ( C.C.S . ) can all play , plus whatever new clean power get invented . And the steadily rising California standard guarantee they ’ ll all have a growing market to sell into .
 A Green Real Deal would be a nationwide effort to inspire and enable Democrats and sensible Republicans to come up with state and local version of S.B . 100 and thereby stimulate America ’ s earth race — not space race — to get to national net-zero emission by 2045 , or earlier .
 It could garner a lot of G.O.P . support in wind state , business could make money off it , and it would put Trump totally on the defensive .
 As Moniz and Karsner wrote in an essay on CNBC.com : “ Climate denier , a well a those with demonstrably impractical , short-term , feel-good solution , are moving u sideways when forward motion is essential . ”
 A Green Real Deal , they argue in The Santa Barbara Independent , would set “ ambitious , but achievable , stretch goal that can be flexibly met and spur innovation and prosperity . ”
 Trump is vulnerable to a bipartisan , industry-friendly plan like this . Last year , The Atlantic reported that “ a coalition of 34 student group from around the country — including 23 chapter of the College Republican — announced the formation of Students for Carbon Dividends , a bipartisan group calling for national legislation to fight climate change . … It mark the first time that a coalition of College Republican group ha publicly backed a climate-change policy . ”
 Glenn Prickett , founder of Rock Creek Strategies , which advises organization and company on how to incorporate the value of nature into economic development , remarked to me : “ I have been sensing something in the air that I have not felt since the late 1980s — when global warming first became prominent and Time magazine made Planet Earth the Person of the Year — and that is that people really want the government to take this issue seriously . I have to give AOC credit for helping get it back on the agenda . ”
 Prickett added : “ I spent 25 year talking about what would happen if we don ’ t address this issue . Now I have to correct myself and say what is happening. ” The impact are real and they are here , “ but what is new is that while the politics remain polarized , business leadership is getting behind this issue and we now have the technology to create scale solution . ”
 I repeat : Later will be too late . So let me end where I began — with Greg Carr in Mozambique ’ s Gorongosa Park , one million acre of wilderness , which ha been protecting both wildlife and the 200,000 people living around it .
 First of all , Carr noted by phone , “ nearly half of Gorongosa Park is now a lake , ” thanks to Cyclone Idai , but it tree and soil “ acted like a giant sponge and absorbed ton of water , ” so flooding of community downstream wa not a bad a it could have been . Parks mitigate climate extreme . “ Hurricanes are going to be more of a problem , and more nature is the solution . I am talking to the government about creating another 250,000 acre of wetland conservancy to the south of u to soak up more water , because this will not be our last cyclone . ”
 It wa also Carr ’ s 260 park ranger who delivered 100,000 pound of food , rescue team and new seed for replanting flooded crop to all the villager living around them . ( To help , go to gorongosa.org/cyclone_relief_fund . ) Carr want to see national park in Africa transformed from just tourist site to economic development engine , absorber of climate change and first responder to disaster .
 Low-lying coastal city in America should be thinking the same . Nine out of 10 home in Beira — Mozambique ’ s fourth-largest city , on it coast — were devastated by Idai . Gorongosa is upstream from Beira and absorbed enough water to prevent that port city from being wiped off the face of the earth , Carr said .
 A Green Real Deal — if framed and focused properly — could wipe that smirk right off Trump ’ s face .

 Before the hacking of Sony Pictures and the Democratic National Committee , before the News of the World tabloid broke into voice-mail message and before the first WikiLeak , there wa Anthony Pellicano .
 Mr. Pellicano wa a private investigator in Hollywood , a man who drove around town with a baseball bat in his trunk and who wa very good at uncovering people ’ s secret . He ran a vast surveillance operation out of his office with a sprawling network of wiretap . If you needed an unpleasant issue to go away , or a nasty tidbit to improve your standing in a divorce or business dispute , he wa the go-to guy .
 He wiretapped the actor Sylvester Stallone and Keith Carradine , and did work on behalf of Chris Rock and Courtney Love , among many others . He conducted an illegal criminal background check on Garry Shandling , threatened a journalist and , according to testimony at his trial , even offered to have a producer murdered , his body buried in the desert . He had been behind bar since 2003 .
 On Friday , the private eye who intimately knew Hollywood ’ s underbelly — and , some would say , wa it leading man — walked out of a Los Angeles federal prison at the end of his sentence and wa free for the first time in more than 15 year .
 Though it ha been a long time since Hollywood last heard much from the man who heard it private conversation , he is hardly forgotten , and some of those he investigated were dreading this day .
 “ It ’ s certainly not comforting , ” said Jude Green , who testified that Mr. Pellicano threatened her during her divorce . “ I ’ m looking for peace and harmony — I ’ ve had enough excitement . ”
 Friends and former employer have not forgotten him , either . Some have contributed to a trust fund worth “ in the ten of thousand ” to help Mr. Pellicano get by , according to a person familiar with the fund who declined to be identified because it wa a private effort . Requests for an interview with Mr. Pellicano , placed through a lawyer , went unanswered .
 Mr. Pellicano , who turned 75 on Friday , wa originally known a an audio expert from Chicago . He wa used a an expert witness by prosecutor and hired by The New York Times in 1979 to determine if the voice on a recording belonged to the former shah of Iran .
 By the 1990s , he had set up shop a a private investigator in Los Angeles who wouldn ’ t open a case without a $ 25,000 retainer and could charge client hundred of thousand of dollar . A former employee testified that in his office on Sunset Boulevard , a Los Angeles police officer on the take would swing by to pick up stack of hundred dollar bill , and a half-dozen iMacs sat recording phone call in his “ war room. ” As recently a last year , he teased in an interview with the The Hollywood Reporter that he might — just might — have Mafia connection .
 “ If you tried to connect me to organized crime , you probably could get close — but no cigar , ” he said .
 In 2002 , his career began to unravel spectacularly . A reporter named Anita Busch , who had written for The New York Times and The Los Angeles Times , had recently published article about the waning career of Michael Ovitz , one of the founder of the Creative Artists Agency and a former president of the Walt Disney Company . That summer , she found what appeared to be a bullet hole in her windshield , along with a dead fish and a rose on a tin tray on the hood of her car . A note wa taped to her car that said , “ Stop . ”
 She later sued Mr. Ovitz for hiring Mr. Pellicano . According to court document , she said that her phone had been tapped , her computer hacked and her hard drive erased . She said that two men in a Mercedes had tried to run her over and that she had been warned that someone planned to blow up her car . Mr. Ovitz planned to argue that the fish wa Steven Seagal ’ s fault — Ms. Busch had been reporting about Mr. Seagal a well — though the F.B.I . found no persuasive evidence that the actor wa involved , according to The Hollywood Reporter .
 She and Mr. Ovitz settled out of court . He did not respond to a request for comment .
 While investigating the threat against Ms. Busch , the authority found grenade and C-4 explosive in a safe in Mr. Pellicano ’ s office . He wa sentenced to 30 month on weapon charge . In 2008 , he wa convicted again , this time on more than 70 charge including racketeering , wire fraud and wiretapping , and he had been in prison until this day .
 “ My code word when I would call the F.B.I. , ” Ms. Green said , “ wa C-4 . ”
 Ms. Green said that Mr. Pellicano cornered her outside a Santa Monica , Calif. , dog groomer where she had taken her Shih Tzu for a haircut . He blocked her car and got in her face , then followed her to a Peet ’ s Coffee , where he boxed her in again and then shoved her inside the store . She said that she yelled to make a scene and fled .
 Mr. Pellicano often represented himself in various case , preferring to refer to himself in the third person . This sometimes created a difficult situation for witness and a variety of odd scene .
 Neville Johnson represented the plaintiff in several lawsuit against Mr. Pellicano and other organization , including the Los Angeles and Beverly Hills police department , where Mr. Pellicano had officer feeding him confidential information .
 Mr. Johnson recalled that during a deposition at a federal prison in Big Spring , Tex. , Mr. Pellicano would say thing like “ I hereby instruct myself not to answer . ”
 That deposition got off to an inauspicious beginning . As Mr. Pellicano sat in the prison cafeteria in his jailhouse uniform , the court reporter instructed him to raise his right hand and asked if he swore to tell the truth .
 “ He said ‘ no , ’ ” Mr. Johnson recalled .
 In addition to his other recording , Mr. Pellicano wa fond of taping his own phone call — including incriminating one — and many of those were recovered by investigator . But the F.B.I . suspected there were even more recording , because on the tape they did find , Mr. Pellicano spoke about storing some audio file outside his office .
 Or so said an F.B.I . agent , Jonathan Mosser , when he wa cross-examined by Mr. Pellicano at his trial :
 Mr. Pellicano : Who wa the person that told you that Mr. Pellicano took audio file and stored them off site ?
 Agent Mosser : Mr. Pellicano .
 Mr. Pellicano : Mr. Pellicano ?
 Mr. Mosser : Yes .
 Mr. Pellicano : When did Mr. Pellicano tell you that he stored information off site ?
 Mr. Mosser : In the audio recording .
 Those tape were never recovered .
 Mr. Pellicano very likely could have faced le time in prison if he had cooperated with the authority , but he never talked . In his interview last year with The Hollywood Reporter , he discussed “ omerta , ” the Mafia code of silence , and the value of keeping secret . Among them , he said , were Michael Jackson ’ s . Mr. Pellicano worked for Mr. Jackson in the 1990s but said he quit when he learned what The Hollywood Reporter described a “ truth even darker than those alleged in Jackson ’ s molestation scandal. ” The Jackson family and estate have denied all allegation of sexual misconduct against him .
 Mr. Pellicano emerges into a world of technology and surveillance vastly different from the one he left behind . With the landscape so changed , and his private investigator license revoked , it is not clear how he will make money now . Lawyers who sued Mr. Pellicano usually gave up because he had no money to pay any judgment .
 He doe , however , emerge with his secret , and whatever value they posse . In a Newsweek interview in 2011 , he claimed that he had offer to publish an autobiography , but that he could not write it because the clamor of prison wa too distracting .
 Bert Fields , a prominent entertainment lawyer in Los Angeles who had worked with Mr. Pellicano over many year , recalled him a doing “ superb work. ” ( Mr. Fields wa investigated in connection with Mr. Pellicano ’ s activity but said he had not used any wiretap in any of his case , and he wa not charged . )
 Mr. Fields said he made a “ minor contribution ” to Mr. Pellicano ’ s post-release trust fund .
 “ He served his time and paid his due , and I felt it wa appropriate to make a contribution , ” he said . “ It had absolutely nothing with trying to keep him quiet or anything like that , and if anyone were to say that , I would probably sue them . ”

 ( Want to get this briefing by email ? Here ’ s the sign-up . )
 Good morning ,
 We ’ re covering a purge of President Trump ’ s homeland security staff , a search for a Brexit path and protest inspired by the Arab Spring .
 A day after the U.S. homeland security secretary , Kirstjen Nielsen , resigned , the departure of the director of the Secret Service , the head of the U.S . Citizenship and Immigration Services , and the department ’ s general counsel were expected .
 The exodus appeared to be part of an effort by President Trump to clear out the department and steer it in a “ tougher ” direction .
 Many immigration policy change require congressional approval , however .
 Visas : The federal government want to issue more visa for foreign worker to take temporary job in housekeeping , landscaping and other field , even a Mr. Trump threatens to seal the border with Mexico , where most of those worker come from .
 In court : A California judge on Monday blocked the president ’ s effort to force asylum seeker to wait in Mexico while their case are adjudicated by the immigration court .
 Prime Minister Theresa May ’ s government continued meeting with official from the opposition Labour Party to discus a compromise plan for Britain ’ s withdrawal from the E.U. , which is currently scheduled for Friday .
 Over the weekend , Mrs. May suggested that a compromise could be worked out around immigration from the E.U. , which could pave the way for maintaining close economic tie with the bloc .
 What ’ s next : The Conservative government and Labour resume talk today , and European leader are expected to meet and consider Mrs. May ’ s request for another Brexit extension on Wednesday .
 Jeremy Corbyn , the Labour leader , face a decision after year of ambiguity regarding his stance on Brexit . Having accepted Mrs. May ’ s offer to negotiate , he will most likely face uncomfortable choice if she softens her stance and try to tempt him with a credible compromise .
 Tens of thousand of demonstrator in Sudan are demanding the ouster of an autocratic ruler . In Algeria , million of protester forced out their own octogenarian leader last week . And in Libya , an aging general is battling to establish himself a a new strongman .
 The hope inspired in 2011 by the Arab Spring uprising , or the wave of anti-government protest in Egypt , Libya , Syria , Tunisia and Yemen , are reverberating across the region , shaking autocratic government and posing question about the future .
 Protesters are seeking an end to closed and corrupt economy and authoritarian government that are unresponsive to the public . “ History repeat itself , ” said one leader of the Egyptian uprising of 2011 .
 What ’ s next : President Trump is expected to host President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt at the White House today . Some scholar say the upheaval is a warning of the risk of embracing such autocratic ally too closely .
 History lesson : Even the meaning of the Arab Spring remains contested . For authoritarian government , it ’ s that popular revolution lead to bedlam . For young people in Algeria and Sudan , it ’ s that nonviolent protest can oust even the most deeply entrenched dictator .
 The country head into a parliamentary election today with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , one of Israel ’ s longest-serving leader , facing stiff competition from a new rival , Benny Gantz , a former army chief .
 Mr. Netanyahu ha overseen healthy economic growth , but charge of bribery , fraud and breach of trust have loomed over his campaign .
 Political bombshell : Over the weekend , Mr. Netanyahu pledged that , if re-elected , he would extend Israel ’ s sovereignty over the West Bank , an apparent last-ditch attempt to woo right-wing voter .
 The West Bank is home to 2.6 million Palestinians . If Mr. Netanyahu carried out his promise , it could end any possibility of a two-state solution .
 Iran : In a move that could give Mr. Netanyahu a boost , President Trump designated an arm of the Iranian military — the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps — a a foreign terrorist organization , the first time the U.S. ha made such a declaration about part of a government .
 Our reporter got aboard a new train service from Ethiopia ’ s capital , Addis Ababa , to the Djibouti coast , part of a planned network that , with China ’ s help , is meant to eventually cover 3,000 mile .
 But even the existing segment offer a voyage of many discovery .
 Boeing : The company ’ s troubled 737 Max wa built on a 1960s design , and it lacked notable safety feature that have been offered for year on other plane . Our reporter look at the history behind the patchwork plane grounded after two crash in five month .
 Britain : The government ha proposed sweeping power to fight the online spread of violent and extremist content , false information and harmful material aimed at child in one of the world ’ s most aggressive plan to regulate the internet .
 Italy : Matteo Salvini , the most powerful figure in Italy ’ s government , announced the formation of a new European alliance of populist and far-right party ahead of critical European Parliament election in May .
 France : Citizens want lower tax and no reduction in public service , according to a three-month national consultation in which some 1.5 million French citizen let the government know what they wanted . It wa President Emmanuel Macron ’ s strategy for sucking the wind out of the Yellow Vest protest movement .
 Snapshot : Poland ’ s governing party ha made gay people it top enemy . Maciej Gosniowski , above left , one of Poland ’ s few drag performer , said that while the vitriol directed at gay wa alarming , he noticed an outpouring of support at the same time . “ The two wing of society seem to be spreading apart , ” he said .
 What we ’ re reading : This Medium collection of interview with writer about how they paid the bill while they wrote their book . Concepción de León , a staff writer for our Books section , recommends it , saying , “ Reading about the job these writer worked — librarian , paramedic , apartment building superintendent — lift the veil on the labor that made possible our favorite story , aside from the labor of writing them . ”
 Cook : Spicy sausage and sweet butternut squash are a perfect match for a sheet-pan dinner . ( Our Five Weeknight Dishes newsletter ha more recommendation . )
 Watch : “ Dumbo , ” Tim Burton ’ s live-action remake of the Disney tale about an airborne baby elephant , “ take a turn toward the fascinatingly weird , ” our critic writes .
 Read : A history of the moon landing 50 year later and a new novel from Sally Rooney are among the 10 book to watch for this month .
 Listen : “ Old Town Road , ” the viral hit by the rapper Lil Nas X that set off a debate about what is , isn ’ t or might be country music , is the focus of our pop music podcast .
 Smarter Living : The kitchen-wear entrepreneur Ellen Bennett organizes her kitchen like a professional chef , to keep from having to hunt around for ingredient and tool . Her method can work for you . Separate cookware by four main function : prep , cook , serve , store . Date and label spice and store them in transparent container . And good knife skill can replace any number of gadget .
 We also have guidance on how to securely mount your flat-screen TV .
 Lately , legging have become a cultural lightning rod . But a new retrospective of the British designer Mary Quant reminds u of an earlier fashion flash point : the miniskirt revolution .
 Ms. Quant , a trailblazer of Swinging Sixties fashion , famously said she “ didn ’ t have time to wait for woman ’ s lib. ” Her higher-than-high hemline insisted on young woman ’ s right to bare their leg .
 She named her trademark skirt after her favorite car , the original Mini Cooper .
 Pieces of clothing resembling miniskirt have been identified by archaeologist a far back a the 1300s B.C. , but it wasn ’ t until the mid-20th century that the mini really took off . Staying true to the Hemline Index ( whereby skirt hemline rise along with stock price ) , the miniskirt perfectly captured 1960s London . The trend ha followed a boom-and-bust cycle ever since .
 Bans on short skirt are enforced in several African country , however , and wearing a mini can prompt outrage — and even criminal arrest — in part of the Middle East .
 That ’ s it for this briefing . See you next time .

 The Carpetbagger

 The past two week have been some of the most hectic of the award-season calendar , but no one ha been busier than Alfonso Cuarón .
 The 57-year-old Mexican director wa a big winner at the Golden Globes on Jan. 6 , when his black-and-white film “ Roma , ” which chronicle a young domestic worker and the Mexico City family she work for , picked up prize for best director and best foreign-language film .
 The next day , Cuarón flew across the country to attend the New York Film Critics Circle Awards , where he wa honored for directing and cinematography and where “ Roma ” took best film , before heading back to the West Coast for more award presented by the Los Angeles Film Critics Association , including cinematography and best picture win .
 And then , after squeezing in some last-minute event during the final day of voting for the Oscar nomination — including a Chateau Marmont party held by Charlize Theron and Diego Luna — Cuarón wa spirited to the Critics ’ Choice Awards in Santa Monica on Sunday night . There , “ Roma ” picked up four more prize : best foreign film , cinematography , director and the final award for best picture .
 No other movie ha won more trophy this past week , or critical laurel over the entire season . But can “ Roma ” make history next month by winning the best picture Oscar , or is there still a ceiling on how high this Netflix-distributed art film can go ?
 First , let ’ s talk about all the thing “ Roma ” ha in it favor . Foremost among them is passion , and “ Roma ” fan are positively evangelical .
 I ’ ve spoken to industry voter who prefer film like “ A Star Is Born , ” “ Green Book ” and “ Bohemian Rhapsody , ” but many of them are almost bashful when divulging their ultimate pick . Not so “ Roma ” voter , who will shout their ardor from the rooftop . They feel an intense connection to Cuarón ’ s film , and though “ Roma ” begin quietly , the film build to some emotionally harrowing sequence that these audience haven ’ t been able to shake .
 Cuarón is no stranger to an award-season campaign — he won the best director Oscar for his last film , “ Gravity ” — and among this year ’ s aspirant , he is one of the warmest and most accessible auteur . I sat at the “ Roma ” table at the Critics ’ Choice Awards , and no commercial break went by without a procession of well-wisher making their way to Cuarón and his leading lady , Yalitza Aparicio and Marina de Tavira , to pay respect , which the director received with a big smile .
 It reminded me of the campaign waged last year by Cuarón ’ s friend Guillermo del Toro , whose “ The Shape of Water ” took home the top two Oscars . I talked to many academy member that season whose vote wa secured once they caught del Toro at a Q & A : They initially liked the film , but that deepened into love after the director passionately contextualized it . Cuarón drew much of “ Roma ” from his own experience growing up in Mexico City during the 1970s , and that personal link will count for a lot .
 [ Alfonso Cuarón take u around Mexico City . ]
 All this might be for naught if it weren ’ t for Netflix ’ s deep-pocketed award bid . Foreign-language Oscar contender usually merit a scant few tastemaker party if they ’ re lucky , but Netflix ha mounted a “ Roma ” campaign more akin to what you ’ d give a Marvel movie . Hollywood is blanketed in billboard bearing Aparicio ’ s face , “ Roma ” event are thrown nearly round the clock , and many industry figure received a heavy $ 175 book about the film published by Assouline . Rival publicist estimate that Netflix is spending $ 10 million to $ 20 million on award-season promotion , though some put that figure even higher .
 It ’ s an unprecedented campaign for a black-and-white foreign film , but then , a best picture win for Netflix would be unprecedented , too . The streaming service ha never so much a fielded a best-picture nominee , and the company is gunning for the win .
 Still , strain of anti-Netflix sentiment remain , and that ’ s one of the headwind facing “ Roma. ” Many in the industry fear that the theatrical component of moviegoing will be depreciated a Netflix continues to gain ground , and though the streaming service tried to assuage those concern by giving “ Roma ” a brief , exclusive theatrical window , the imminent arrival of Disney and Apple in the streaming space will only pull more focus from traditional distribution method .
 There is also the fact that no foreign-language film ha ever won best picture . The closest analog may be “ The Artist , ” another black-and-white movie that took the prize seven year ago , but though it wa made by the French director Michel Hazanavicius and starred French lead , it wa ultimately a Hollywood-set film made in English . In the academy ’ s yearslong bid to increase diversity , it ha begun courting a far more international membership , but a foreign-language best picture win would still prove notable in a year with plenty of homegrown Hollywood product to choose from .
 I also wonder if Aparicio ’ s lack of best-actress traction may indicate that passion for “ Roma ” is high but not wide . Though she wa nominated at the Critics ’ Choice Awards ( losing to Glenn Close and Lady Gaga , who tied ) , she wa snubbed by the Golden Globes and Screen Actors Guild , and the latter is particularly concerning given that actor make up the academy ’ s biggest voting branch .
 Foreign-language performer like Isabelle Huppert ( “ Elle ” ) and Marion Cotillard ( “ Two Days , One Night ” ) have broken into the best-actress category without the benefit of Netflix ’ s marketing money or the heat of a major best-picture contender , so if she ’ s left out of the final five when Oscar nomination are announced next week , Netflix ought to be concerned : Only 11 film have gone on to win best picture without scoring any acting nomination .
 It ’ s enough to keep Cuarón on his toe despite all those laurel from critic , and this unpredictable best-picture race is starting to become the sort of battle between art and commerce hinted at when the academy tried to introduce an Oscar for best popular film . Though “ Roma ” is more widely available than nearly any other Oscar contender by dint of it streaming distribution , it ’ s still an art movie that open with a long , unbroken shot of washed pavement , showing on a service that ha gotten impatient viewer accustomed to a “ skip intro ” feature .
 Several huge hit are likely to be in the Oscar mix this year : “ A Star Is Born ” and Golden Globe winner “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” will both vie to be the biggest best-picture winner at the box office since “ Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King , ” while “ Black Panther ” would be the highest-grossing film to ever win that top prize . Might they all be beaten by a foreign-language film whose theatrical gross weren ’ t even reported ? In an eccentric Oscar season , that might be the ultimate twist .

 DAILY CROSSWORD COLUMN
 Don ’ t judge this Sophia Maymudes and Jeff Chen puzzle by it cover .
 By Caitlin Lovinger
 SUNDAY PUZZLE — The first thing I wa struck by when looking at today ’ s grid wa the distinctive pattern — it ’ s got mirror symmetry , not unknown on a Sunday , but uncommon and very much like a Rorschach test , at least to me ( for statistical comparison , there were three such Sunday grid last year ) . I see a teddy bear today , flexing it muscle . The second thing I noted wa the return of young Sophia Maymudes , whose extremely adorable debut last December is a must-do-next for whoever missed it ( especially if you saw some cute creature hidden in this grid like I did . Hint . )
 According to Will Shortz ’ s note from the print magazine , Jeff Chen set up the interesting grid , Ms. Maymudes did the interesting fill , and both wrote clue collaborating over 100 or so email . According to Ms. Maymudes ’ s note below , they were on separate continent for this entire production . This seems like a book proposal for a 21st-centry epistolary tale , given the context of today ’ s puzzle .
 There is a charming high-low mix of fill today that might have to do with the puzzle ’ s collaborative origin . I ’ d put POOP , TPS and NAPPY on one side , and ATRIA , DIJON and SERIF on the other , for a start . I didn ’ t know ROEG or NIETO and I got stuck at SILENT ES , ERRATA , SAGES , FLAT RATE and a few other spot .
 For young child , both constructor did a good job pulling from all era for their vernacular cluing — the one thing I saw that might nonplus wa OWE , a Venmo giveth , and Venmo taketh away . On the other hand , GARP , GANGSTER and TITO , among others , drew from the last century .
 5A : At some point I had all but the first letter here and popped in “ oink ” for this clue , “ Squealer. ” Sort of make sense , in my opinion , but it totally ruined 5D and slowed me down considerably since I didn ’ t know Johnny OLSON , either , right beneath this clue . An “ oinker ” could be a squealer , but a jailhouse FINK definitely is .
 57A : You ’ re doing this now , probably ! This clue reminded me of someone I know talking about her small child staring out of a window of her apartment , bored , and repeatedly swiping left on the glass in pursuit of interesting new content . On a regular browser , when you “ go through your window , ” you ’ re liable to SCROLL a screen or so .
 81A : If you had “ opal ” for ONYX at 67D this wa tough ; even after I got the “ x ” at the end , I first entered “ gore tex , ” maybe because it ’ s the middle of March and still 36 degree here . Much like this puzzle , in mid-March a SPANDEX swimsuit is tight , am I right ?
 12D : This ha to be one of the most famous song from a seminal band from the late ’ 70 and 1980s , and a soon a I got a few cross PUMP IT UP dawned on me , but those opening lyric rang no bell , which made this a certifiably tricky clue a far a I ’ m concerned . Check out Elvis Costello ’ s foot and ankle in this video and do not try this at home , jeez . They are hypnotic .
 34D : Maybe because of some of today ’ s theme subject , I took “ outgoing ” in this clue to mean shuffling off this mortal coil , so this clue wa completely mystifying . LOOPY refers to the big balloon letter that some people use , but in the era of typing and touch screen I find myself using this technique out of sheer clumsiness with a pen .
 52D : A terrific pun clue , “ Not go overboard , ” for riding the wave without a prop , like someone who BODYSURFS . I liked the visuals of this entry and it neighbor to the right , WIND FARMS .
 95D : I imagine this is a true stumper for a lot of u , although I had my eureka moment a while after I ’ d figured it out on the cross . It ’ s also a surprising debut — “ Tupac ” ha been in the puzzle many time but never by his full name or surname . Tupac SHAKUR , despite having been killed at the age of 25 , had created so much content that his estate ha indeed provided material for seven album , so far , since his death .
 Ms. Maymudes and Mr. Chen have mixed up our library today , swapping the dust jacket on biography and other book , creating appropriate but quirky new title for notable life story . There are eight biographical subject referred to in the clue , five across and three down , including the momentous ( Willie Mays , Archimedes ) , the mysterious ( Amelia Earhart ) and the marble ( Venus de Milo ) .
 Let ’ s take Venus at 92A a a first example . Arguably one of the most famous sculpture in the world , on permanent display at the Louvre and instantly recognizable by what she doesn ’ t have , this tall Classical figure wa originally discovered in 1820 on the Greek isle of Melos , in several piece . Supposedly , her upper limb were either never found , or deemed later fake and left on the island when she wa taken to France . So she bid adieu to more than her home — she embodies the spirit of Ernest Hemingway ’ s title , at least : A FAREWELL TO ARMS .
 ( As an aside , New Yorkers , there are three headless Venuses de Milo in Midtown , courtesy of Jim Dine . There may be more of these in other city , and it ’ s always nice to notice street art . )
 O.K. , let ’ s do a character out of fiction : Ebenezer Scrooge from “ A Christmas Carol ” at 23A . Not a nice guy and the last mean old skinflint we ’ d associate with a destructive-but-lovable Labrador retriever . Lo and behold , though , the ghost behind the triple haunting of Scrooge that turn him , er , a bit more lovable is Scrooge ’ s business partner Jacob Marley . So perhaps it ’ d be more of an autobiography , if you follow me , but the answer here , vi a vi Scrooge , is MARLEY AND ME , the 2005 best-seller by John Grogan about a dog ( who wa named after Bob and not Jacob , unsurprisingly ) .
 Are you still with me ? We can do the one that I found hardest , 4D , modern hero Thomas Crapper of the plumbing Crappers ( you can , today , purchase a toilet with the Thomas Crapper name proudly embossed on it tank ) . I knew this name and assumed that I ’ d seen it in the crossword , but it ’ s never appeared in our grid , in total or just by surname , so who know . I definitely didn ’ t have a handle on the quirky biography title called for in this game , and figured it out tentatively on cross — A GAME OF THRONES . Never watched the show but I ’ d somehow learned a few title in the series of book that inspired it , by George R.R . Martin , and none of them wa this — turn out the whole series go by that title , which make sense , like “ The Chronicles of Narnia ” or what have you . Perfectly fair .
 The rest of the theme answer were more accessible to me , and really entertaining . One wa kind of mordant ( 31A , Amelia Earhart ) ; one wa kind of highbrow ( 34A , Archimedes ) . I knew only the title for the Elvis pick at 110/112A , but that wa enough , it ’ s famous enough that I probably should have read it at some point . 13D , Willie Mays , is a lifelong favorite , on the other hand , and a wonderful choice . Walt Disney , at 43/44D , might a well have a biography by that name sitting on a shelf somewhere , honestly .

 Jeff and I connected after I sent him a crossword I ’ d written about our other mutual passion : bridge . When we decided to try co-constructing , I sent him this theme . It ’ s one I ’ d been kicking around since a friend and I came up with the 23-Across clue/answer pair while solving a different puzzle , but I ’ d never found a set of theme answer I liked for a 15x15 . Jeff wa the one who suggested making a Sunday puzzle , which I ’ d never even attempted to create before , but Jeff wa great about helping me out when I got stuck , and I learned a lot .
 Thanks so much to Jeff for working with me on this puzzle and pushing me to make the grid the best it could possibly be . Ironically , even though we live in the same Seattle neighborhood , we ’ ve yet to meet in person — I wa studying abroad in Hungary during the entirety of this puzzle ’ s construction !
 Jeff Chen :
 Great fun to help Sophia develop this idea . She ’ s in college now , so doesn ’ t have that much time for crossword construction . But after she graduate , I think she could rise all the way to the top , if she decides to put more time into it .

 Critic ’ s Notebook
 By Manohla Dargis
 PARK CITY , Utah — Every year , the Sundance Film Festival arrives with the usual hype , unreasonable expectation and the audience ’ s ravenous appetite for the new . And each year , despite the reliably tough odds ( movie are hard to get made ) and the industry ’ s perpetual existential dread ( thing are always bad unless they ’ re awful ) , Sundance come through . It showcase good and sometimes great movie that affirm that there is more to contemporary American cinema than bland , branded product , a truism that will carry greater , deeper significance when these title enter the larger , Disney-dominated world .
 For movie lover exhausted by the circus called award season the arrival in January of the new and unseen is especially welcome . That ’ s the case even when there ’ s no consensus favorite like “ Beasts of the Southern Wild ” ( 2012 ) to ignite Sundance . More common are the year defined by low-key discovery , the one that seem unlikely to hit the cinema jackpot — the critic , box office and zeitgeist — a powerfully a Jordan Peele ’ s 2017 freakout , “ Get Out , ” did .
 This year ’ s best shot at mainstream success is “ Late Night , ” a smart comedy about a talk-show host , Katherine ( Emma Thompson , superb ) who receives a much-needed jolt from an unlikely new writer , Molly ( Mindy Kaling , who wrote the script ) . The director Nisha Ganatra doesn ’ t do much visually but she adroitly work around Kaling ’ s stand-and-deliver acting and give Thompson the room she need to turn a cliché into a striking character .
 The movie shrewdly lead with comedy — it ha belly laugh and zinger — even a it skitters over , and at time dive into , question of diversity and sexism in entertainment industry , including from other woman . Katherine , a transformational figure because she ’ s the only female late-night host , decides she need to shake thing up by bringing a woman onto her all-male writing staff . Once upon a time , she bashed through a glass ceiling without offering a hand up to other woman , a story with real-world sting . Katherine isn ’ t interested in diversity : She hire a woman for selfish reason . And Molly delivers because she ’ s talented — she just needed to get in the room .
 As is often the case , some of the best movie I saw at the festival arrived quietly , without celebrity and clamor , and are unlikely to rack up the sale that generate splashy news . Amazon went on a shopping spree here , buying a number of title , including “ Late Night ” and “ The Report , ” from Scott Z. Burns , who ’ s better known for his script ( “ The Bourne Ultimatum ” ) . Eminently watchable and rather too self-satisfied , “ The Report ” center on a Senate staffer ( a fine Adam Driver ) who is tasked by his bos , Dianne Feinstein ( a bone-dry , finely calibrated Annette Bening ) , with investigating the C.I.A. ’ s interrogation method in the wake of Sept. 11 .
 The presence of another great actress , Alfre Woodard , a Sundance veteran onscreen and off ( she wa on a 1985 jury ) , wa enough to send me to “ Clemency , ” the second feature from the writer-director Chinonye Chukwu and a standout in the dramatic competition . Woodard play Bernadine Williams , a coolly efficient warden who ’ s overseen some dozen execution . As she prepares for the death of another inmate — played by an outstanding Aldis Hodge — Bernadine begin disappearing into her own profound isolation . With visual austerity and not an ounce of sentimentality , Chukwu transforms a character study into an indictment of institutionalized murder , the horror of which is made harrowingly palpable a Bernadine ’ s face becomes a rictus of pain .
 The other dramatic competition high point wa the plaintive , gorgeous and finally exultant “ The Last Black Man in San Francisco , ” the first feature directed by Joe Talbot . It center on a young , romantically despondent skateboarder , Jimmie Fails ( actor and character share the name ) , who can ’ t let go of the glorious Victorian house that his family lost year earlier . When the house ’ s current owner conveniently exit , Jimmie and his sole friend , Montgomery ( Jonathan Majors ) , take possession in a story that doesn ’ t announce it theme but instead transforms lived-in idea about friendship , loneliness , artmaking , gentrification and the many face of black masculinity .
 The most heart-skippingly passage in “ The Last Black Man in San Francisco ” don ’ t so much drive the story a slow thing down , enriching it . In an early scene , Jimmie skateboard out of his neighborhood — the faithful Mont hop on the board behind him — into a city that becomes progressively white and visually static ( they breeze by in a different time signature ) . Other people often seem a mystery to Jimmie , who ’ s estranged from his parent and much of the world . But they ’ re fodder for Mont , who carry around a red sketchbook filled with portrait and scribble , and who eventually transforms a world of loss into touchingly reflexive art .
 Directed by Kirill Mikhanovsky , who share script credit with Alice Austen , “ Give Me Liberty ” at time brings to mind the work of Aleksei German , a Russian master of controlled chaos . It follows a young Russian-American , Vic ( Chris Galust ) , who over the course of a hilarious , poignant and very wild day and night in Milwaukee , ferry disabled passenger to and from their appointment while he try to deliver a boisterous gaggle of elderly mourner to a funeral . As he careen from one destination to the next , Vic begin a beautifully nuanced relationship with one of his passenger , Tracy ( Lauren Spencer ) , a young woman with A.L.S . who us a wheelchair .
 Completely , delightfully unpredictable from scene to scene , “ Give Me Liberty ” draw you in with it moving performance and blast of broad comedy — much provided by a visitor played by Maksim Stoyanov — that are delivered with whiplash camerawork , abrupt cut and sudden tone shift . Its matter-of-fact approach to disability , including in some deeply moving exchange between Vic and a profoundly disabled older man , is a tonic . Diversity is a mantra at Sundance , which ha long been publicly committed to inclusion , but disabled people haven ’ t always been part of that mix .
 Over the year , the diversity ha deepened , become more layered , partly because , I imagine , ambitious filmmaker of increasingly different background know that Sundance will be receptive to them . The festival still program familiar coming-of-age story about teenager who learn something important ; this year ’ s crop included male-driven tale like “ Adam ” and “ Big Time Adolescence ” a well a Minhal Baig ’ s “ Hala , ” about a young Muslim girl whose identity struggle evoke “ Pariah , ” Dee Rees ’ s 2011 Sundance dazzler . Palatable , easy-to-watch movie have always been part of the Sundance mix ; if only it programmer would embrace aesthetic and narrative diversity more fully .
 In time , moviegoer will be able to see some of the festival ’ s best title , including Joanna Hogg ’ s elegantly fractured drama “ The Souvenir , ” about a young film student and her older lover . Invariably , some attendee will insist that this year wa another disappointment , though it ’ s worth remembering that the 2018 edition — which included “ Leave No Trace , ” “ Sorry to Bother You ” and “ Three Identical Strangers ” — wa similarly pegged before the festival ended . By the time the 2020 edition arrives , some of this year ’ s finest movie — including must-see documentary like “ American Factory , ” “ The Brink , ” “ One Child Nation , ” “ Knock Down the House ” and “ Hail Satan ? ” — will have come and gone . And Sundance will be reliably ready to disappoint and delight all over again .

 Felicity Huffman hated the myth of the perfect mother .
 “ She should go the way of the dinosaur , extinct , ” Huffman wrote in exasperation a few year ago on her blog , where she agonized about losing her cool with her child and not being an easygoing mother — and where she also sold mug bearing cutesy quote like “ I Can ’ t Adult Today ” and “ Good Enough Mom . ”
 Yet Huffman , who is 56 , wa competitive and driven . Maybe no one could be a perfect mother , but she could still try to be a great one . She joined parent ’ committee , threw elaborate Halloween party using top of the line studio prop and , with her husband , William H. Macy , leveraged her celebrity to support the prestigious Los Angeles County High School for the Arts , where Sophia , the elder of their two daughter , studied theater and thrived .
 Huffman , an Emmy winner for “ Desperate Housewives , ” and Macy , an Oscar nominee for “ Fargo , ” taught acting workshop at the school , hosted fund-raising gala , and donated at least $ 20,000 to it foundation , while fellow parent basked in their proximity to such a beloved Hollywood pair .
 They are not quite a beloved anymore . Huffman wa led out of her Hollywood Hills home by F.B.I . agent on March 12 , accused of making a $ 15,000 payoff so a crooked test proctor could tinker with Sophia ’ s SAT answer . Her arrest came a part of a broad investigation of a cheating and bribery scheme that involved 50 people and ha fueled a national debate about fairness in college admission .
 [ Here ’ s what you need to know about the college cheating scandal . ]
 The scandal left some administrator at the high school in damage-control mode , and people close to Flicka and Billy , a the couple are still known in their old theater circle , reeling and conflicted : What on Earth had Huffman and Macy been thinking ?
 In the criminal complaint outlining the case , investigator said multiple email and recorded telephone conversation showed that Huffman ’ s involvement in the cheating conspiracy began in summer 2017 and continued into February of this year . Macy ha not been charged , but the complaint said that he had agreed to the cheating plan for Sophia , and accused him of plotting the same cheating arrangement for their younger daughter before the couple abandoned the idea .
 Huffman , who wa arrested on two charge — conspiracy to commit mail fraud and conspiracy to commit honest service mail fraud — ha not yet entered a plea . She wa released on $ 250,000 bond , and is due in federal court in Boston , where the investigation is based , on April 3 . Her lawyer would not comment .
 Friends and fellow parent at Sophia ’ s school lamented the fact that Huffman ha become one of the few public face of the scandal , even though her case involves a relatively small sum compared with what others are accused of spending ; one father is said to have made $ 1.2 million in payoff .
 The theater producer Frederick Zollo , who worked with Huffman and Macy on play year ago , said that while payoff were “ obviously a very stupid thing , ” Huffman had already been punished enough . “ I think the public humiliation is more than sufficient , ” he said .
 The playwright David Mamet , the couple ’ s friend and collaborator of many decade , sprang to their defense in an open letter urging people to hate the game of corrupt college admission rather than hate these player , whose parental instinct were understandable .
 But some who knew the couple in the past saw hypocrisy in Huffman and Macy ’ s action and in the friend who protectively stood by them . “ People shield people of power ; nobody want to speak truth to power because they might need them , ” said Théo Cohan Feldman , who , along with Huffman , Macy and Mamet , wa among the founding member of the Atlantic Theater Company in New York . Feldman rejected the notion that this might have been a mere mistake . The couple , she said , had always been very smart and very deliberate .
 “ I don ’ t think that ha changed with fame and success , ” Feldman said . “ They took a calculated risk . ”
 Huffman met Macy in New York in the early 1980s when he wa leading acting workshop with Mamet and she wa a theater student at New York University . Huffman came from privilege : Her maternal grandfather helped found Morgan Stanley , and her father wa a partner there . She wa the youngest of eight , and joked that her mother named her Flicka — officially it wa Felicity — because she had run out of name . When Huffman wa 7 , the family moved from Bedford , a New York City suburb , to Little Woody Creek , Colo. , and into a white clapboard house that sat on 27 acre , where six of the sister , including Felicity , would later get married .
 In an interview with the Television Academy , Huffman said she vividly recalled first meeting Macy , with his sweep of blond hair and Lacoste shirt ; per the fashion of the time , he had flipped the collar up . He wa 12 year her senior — and married — and Huffman found him funny , cool and smart . “ Like a god , ” she said . The pair eventually began dating and , after year of being on and off , married in 1997 .
 Among their theater friend in New York , they were deeply admired . “ She and Bill are such caring people , intelligent people , ” said Bradley White , an actor who knew them here . Huffman , he said , wa “ someone with a strong spine , and a heart of gold. ” She wa also known for being unafraid to be forthright , sometimes to the point of harshness , a trait of which she wa evidently aware . One friend recalled visiting the couple ’ s home in the Outpost Estates neighborhood of the Hollywood Hills and spotting a largish sign in Huffman ’ s office. “ Be nice , ” it read .
 By the time Sophia wa born , in 2000 , Macy had hit like “ Fargo , ” Boogie Nights ” and “ Air Force One , ” behind him , and Huffman had starred in Aaron Sorkin ’ s acclaimed television show “ Sports Night. ” Her star continued to rise after their second daughter , Georgia , wa born in 2002 .
 Huffman landed a starring role in “ Desperate Housewives ” and received an Oscar nomination for her lead role in the 2005 film “ Transamerica. ” In 2012 , when “ Desperate Housewives ” ended and a year after Macy ’ s show “ Shameless ” began , she started her blog , and named it “ What the Flicka . ”
 It wa pulled offline a few day after her arrest . But before it vanished , it wa a gold mine for anyone seeking inconsistency between the action Huffman is charged with and the version of parenting she espoused on the blog , where she touted the importance of honesty , confronting fear and reading book like “ The Blessing of a B Minus , ” which caution against micromanaging the life of child .
 Huffman used the blog to deploy you-go-girl affirmation and confessional . “ If our kid are alive and decent citizen at 18 , we all deserve a medal , ” she wrote at one point , punctuating the thought with an expletive before “ medal. ” In another post , she wrote , “ I have made so many mistake a a parent it actually make me nauseous to think about it . ”
 [ Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin : How college admission scandal ensnared star . ]
 She also seemed painfully aware of her privilege and ability to disconnect from troubling world event , wondering , in a 2014 post , how she could stomach shopping at Target given the massive garbage patch in the ocean , or blithely prepare for her daughter ’ s slumber party when hundred of Nigerian schoolgirl had been kidnapped by Boko Haram .
 The High School for the Arts , where Sophia is a senior , is tuition-free and highly selective , and it 600 student must audition to get in . Though the school is public , a well-connected foundation help bridge the nearly $ 1 million annual gap between taxpayer funding and the art program ’ s operating cost . Its donor list includes Disney , ABC , NBCUniversal , Showtime , Sony , Paul Thomas Anderson and Frank Gehry , who ha one son teaching at the school and another who is an alum . In 2017 , another parent , the comedian Jeff Garlin , hosted a fund-raiser for the school featuring Jane Lynch , Sarah Silverman and Tommy Chong .
 Even against this high-octane backdrop , Sophia , who is 18 , stood out . She won award and accolade and frequently landed leading role in dramatic production , including the part of Mary Jane in a one-act Spider-Man play in January .
 It is unclear if Sophia knew anything about her SAT answer getting fixed . According to the criminal complaint , after a bribed proctor got involved , her score improved by some 400 point from her Preliminary SAT exam .
 At the school , student and parent interviewed largely feel Sophia wa unfairly swept up in the scandal . Beyond feeling disappointment and anger , people were puzzled . Sophia wa talented in her own right . Some university were now threatening to reject student whose parent had been arrested . Why would Huffman and Macy take the risk ?
 Not everyone wa surprised that a parent might cross a line like this one . Camilo Estrada , who graduated from the vocal program there in 2012 , said he had seen parent hector teacher — including one incident backstage during a school performance — for not giving their child more stage time .
 Melanie Lundquist , a philanthropist whose foundation ha donated $ 60 million to Los Angeles public school , said bribe and payoff were just a logical next step for parent with resource to buy special access to college . “ It progressed from buying a building to being this bold about it , ” she said .
 Chris Hunter , 24 , an alumnus of the high school and co-director of it opera program , said rumor and barbed joke were flying . “ It ’ s college admission time , and one student got into an opera school , ” he said , “ And other student have said , ‘ Guess your parent paid your way . ’ ”
 Parents worry about the fallout , especially since Huffman and Macy were such prominent booster . “ They were the face of the school , ” said Mark Mothersbaugh , the frontman for the band Devo , who ha a daughter there .
 A few day after Huffman ’ s arrest , Rabbi Jonathan Aaron and his congregant at Temple Emanuel of Beverly Hills spent a Shabbat session talking about the scandal and debating unfair privilege . Was editing a daughter ’ s essay unfair ? Was tutoring ? One congregant said the couple should be in jail . Another said celebrity often acted without consequence .
 The rabbi admitted he wa angry , too . His daughter wa a senior at the school , waiting for word on what college she herself would get into .

 Three year to the day after the death of David Bowie , two eminence of American music will come together in Los Angeles to pay tribute .
 John Adams is set to conduct the Los Angeles Philharmonic in the premiere of Philip Glass ’ s Symphony No . 12 , “ Lodger , ” at Walt Disney Concert Hall on Thursday . The work is inspired by Bowie ’ s 1979 collaboration with Brian Eno and the producer Tony Visconti , the final album in what ’ s usually called their Berlin trilogy , which also includes “ Low ” and “ Heroes , ” both from 1977 . Mr. Glass ’ s First Symphony , back in 1992 , wa based on “ Low ” ; his Fourth ( 1996 ) , on “ Heroes . ”
 “ I put off the third for a long time — 20 year — before I realized that I owed them something , ” Mr. Glass said in a recent telephone interview .
 Mr. Adams wa also on the conference call — he in Berkeley , Calif. , Mr. Glass in New York — to discus the symphony , Bowie and whether Mr. Glass ’ s music is hard to conduct . Here are edited excerpt from the conversation .
 How did this symphony come about ?
 PHILIP GLASS It ’ s part of a commitment I had made to David Bowie and Brian Eno to take three of their record and turn them into symphony . In “ Lodger , ” to me the most interesting thing wa the lyric , the poem .
 In the earlier one , the musical idea wa quite challenging and worthwhile to work on , but when I got to “ Lodger , ” I didn ’ t find that interest in the musical part of it ; the interest wa in the text . After hedging a little bit , I thought I might a well make a song symphony . Mahler , of course , wa the great one at that . I used seven of the text ; I didn ’ t use all 10 . That would have pushed me over an hour , and I didn ’ t want to go there .
 I don ’ t know , John , if you ’ re aware of this , but this wa written — the word were written — when David wa living in Berlin .
 JOHN ADAMS Yeah , you mentioned that to me .
 GLASS And Brian wa there , and Iggy Pop wa there ; those were his companion . They were there trying to make a movie out of “ The Idiot ” by Dostoyevsky . None of them spoke Russian , or German , even . But on the other hand , these were three really interesting people in our music world and music life , and made big statement — icon , all of them .
 ADAMS A really great text is just so generative ; it produce the best music . If I have a concern about some opera these day , it ’ s that the text are just not good enough . It doesn ’ t have to be someone with a deep literary background ; it can be a David Bowie or Brian Eno . The great thing about American music is the total bleed-through of , if you want to call it that , high or low , popular versus art . I think both Philip and I share this . We have very loose filter in term of classification .
 When did you first hear each other ’ s music ?
 ADAMS The thing I remember most vividly is a tour of the ensemble doing excerpt from “ Einstein on the Beach , ” which I heard in San Francisco sometime in the 1970s . Then I actually conducted quite a bit of his music — a little piece , “ Facades , ” and then I think we did the very first performance of part of “ Akhnaten ” in L.A. on a Phil program , 50 minute ’ worth . I did the Ninth Symphony , again with L.A. , and then this .
 I came of age during what we now call the bad old day , when the world said you had a choice between European modernism and it American version , or Cagean aesthetic . Hearing Philip ’ s music and Steve [ Reich ’ s ] music wa this wonderful , new possibility of a language that embraced both tonality and sort of living with a pulse , new , original and fresh .
 GLASS I wa very much taken with hearing John ’ s work — of course , “ Nixon in China , ” we talked about a number of time . It ’ s not enough to create a style of music or identity of your own ; what you really want to be is in the company of other people . It ’ s more meaningful to be part of a large group of people sharing idea .
 He wa the first time I met someone who wasn ’ t part of my immediate generation but had the interest and talent . How many opera do you have now ? Five or six ?
 ADAMS [ Laughing ] Not a many a you do ! [ Depending on how you count , Mr. Glass ha composed nearly 30 . ]
 Is Philip ’ s music tough to conduct ?
 ADAMS It continues to be a slow absorption of Philip ’ s orchestral music into the regular repertoire ; I ’ m surprised that more conductor haven ’ t taken it on . He ha a couple of symphony , like the Eighth , where there are some real challenge rhythmically .
 But it ’ s not hard to conduct on a technical level . I think the challenge is creating a sound , and with some orchestra it ’ s simply getting them into the right frame of mind . Something like the Ninth Symphony , which is nearly an hour long , it demand a kind of Zen-like concentration by the player , the way some Bruckner symphony do . It ’ s not like doing “ The Rite of Spring , ” where there ’ s a thrill every 10 second . You have a steady build and a long line .
 What doe it pair best with ?
 ADAMS I don ’ t think there ’ s a great challenge there . You could put anything with it . I see program that have put a piece of Philip ’ s together with a Baroque piece ; that make sense in certain way . I ’ ve put his smaller piece on program with my own music , but sometimes with Steve or Terry [ Riley ] : obvious harmonious conjunction . This program we ’ re doing at the L.A. Phil , I ’ m doing with an old piece of mine , “ Grand Pianola Music . ”
 GLASS I ’ m delighted to be able to hear it again . I haven ’ t heard it in a long time .
 Philip , doe it annoy you that these symphony are still not done more widely ?
 GLASS Quite the opposite : I ’ m astonished at the size of audience I ’ m getting now . I never thought that this music would be accepted in the way it ’ s being accepted . I had my first performance with the New York Philharmonic when I wa 80 year old . I mean , come on !
 I think it ’ s partly that I ’ ve been helped by a younger generation that ha very broad idea and taste , and I don ’ t seem nearly a strange a I used to be . I ’ ve become — not mainstream , that seems a little too far — but still I can tell from the Ascap [ the music licensing agency ] report that the music is being used .
 ADAMS A central thing about Philip ’ s music is it is utterly original , it is immediately identifiable a his , and that is an extraordinary thing , and it ’ s actually a very rare thing . It ’ s such an astonishing thing that Philip did , which wa to take very , very simple material and a simple mode of expression , and create something that wa original . And it just caught on in an immensely popular way . It ’ s an honor to be a part of it .
 GLASS I have to publicly apologize for getting you the score so late .
 ADAMS [ Laughing ] It ’ s O.K . ; we all do it .

 ( Want to get this briefing by email ? Here ’ s the sign-up . )
 Good morning ,
 We ’ re covering a White House whistle-blower ’ s account of security clearance irregularity , intensifying scrutiny on Joe Biden , and a rash of racehorse death at a track in California .
 Politicians might not have figured out Britain ’ s departure from the European Union , but for much of the business world , Brexit ha effectively happened .
 Banks and other financial service company have shifted job and asset to the Continent , and Japanese automaker have scrapped expansion plan . Whatever come next , the job and money are unlikely to return .

 We often ask reader for Back Story idea . Zach Lewis of Chicago suggested we look at the naming of black and white rhino , both of which are in fact gray .
 They have different face . The black rhino , which tends to eat tree and bush , ha a pointed upper lip , while the grass-grazing white rhino ha a broader one .
 In 2003 , Kees Rookmaaker , a rhino researcher , analyzed 10 theory about the name .
 A popular idea wa that the Afrikaans word “ wyd , ” or Dutch “ wijd , ” meaning “ wide , ” became “ white. ” “ Black ” wa simply an easy contrast .
 Some other theory : The grazing rhino looked white in grassland ; it rolled in lighter mud or wa often covered in bird droppings ; albinism is more common among white rhino ; and that at some point , the rhino were noticeably lighter and darker .
 The mistranslation theory wa the one he found least likely . “ There is no record of ‘ wydrhinoceros ’ in the literature , ” he emailed recently , noting that Dutch speaker would have used “ breed , ” meaning “ broad , ” rather than “ wijd . ”
 Speaking of eye-catching fauna , a new specie of tarantula ha become a scientific celebrity . But the discovery ha renewed an old ethical debate about specimen collection and “ biopiracy . ”

 As a part of what ’ s been called jazz ’ s “ neoclassical ” period , the virtuoso trumpeter Roy Hargrove won acclaim a a formidable standard improvisor in the hard-bop mode .

 Between the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600 and the 1868 Meiji Restoration , Japan wa unified and at peace under the Tokugawa Shogunate . Popular art flourished , and , though the country wa officially closed for most of the period , foreign influence did trickle in .
 “ The Poetry of Nature : Edo Paintings from the Fishbein-Bender Collection , ” which you can catch for just a few more week at the Metropolitan Museum of Art , offer two ink painting by Mori Sosen that are inflected with Western anatomical realism to mesmerizing effect .

 Let u help you start your day .
 By Penn Bullock
 ( Want to get this briefing by email ? Here ’ s the sign-up . )
 Good morning .
 Venezuela ’ s opposition leader vow to return to the country , India and Pakistan are still at loggerhead and we go inside the Trump-Kim talk . Here ’ s the latest :
 Venezuela ’ s opposition leader , Juan Guaidó , ha toured South America for much of the past week . Defying a government-imposed travel ban , he met with the far-right president of Brazil and the center-left president of Ecuador , among others , to demonstrate the broad international support for his claim to be the legitimate leader of Venezuela .
 Each day he spends out the country , though , he risk losing the unity of opposition party , already reeling after President Nicolás Maduro last month reduced Mr. Guaidó ’ s promised “ aid avalanche ” at the border to a few flake . Mr. Guaidó had vowed to re-enter Venezuela a those aid shipment broke through Mr. Maduro ’ s blockade . He ha now set a deadline of this morning for his return .
 Mr. Maduro ha threatened to have him arrested .
 Bigger picture : With Mr. Maduro firmly controlling the border , and defection from his military so far a trickle , the opposition is realizing that the government ’ s rule appears to be more durable than Mr. Guaidó had painted it .
 Looking ahead : The secretary general of the Organization of American States , Luis Almagro , who is one of Mr. Guaidó ’ s chief international supporter , softened his demand on Mr. Maduro , saying he would not object to his running for office again in new election if they were free and fair .
 The two nuclear-armed neighbor exchanged artillery fire on Saturday , killing at least five civilian and two soldier and making it clear that hostility over the disputed Kashmir region are hardly over .
 The recent flare-up , with both side accusing the other of firing first , came just a day after Pakistan returned a captured Indian pilot a a good-will gesture .
 Dispute : Independent security analyst continue to question India ’ s claim that it targeted a “ large number ” of terrorist at a major training camp in Pakistan last week . Satellite imagery of the area showed India “ didn ’ t hit their target , ” according to a think tank in Washington .
 Go deeper : After an aging Indian warplane wa shot down by Pakistan , New Delhi ’ s military preparedness is under renewed scrutiny . The Indian military is in such a troubled state that , according to government estimate , if intense warfare broke out tomorrow it troop would have enough ammunition for only 10 day .
 On the ground : Kashmir ’ s complicated history , tugged in different direction by two muscular power , ha left it local population with a dark future and under the constant threat of death .
 The nuclear talk in Vietnam last week between President Trump and Kim Jong-un , the North Korean leader , were doomed before they even started , with no basic starting point established and some of Mr. Trump ’ s aide questioning whether they should happen .
 Banking on the force of his own personality and their rapport , Mr. Trump offered Mr. Kim the same deal North Korea ha rejected for a quarter-century : total nuclear disarmament in exchange for full sanction relief . For his part , Mr. Kim miscalculated that Mr. Trump might accept a more modest offer .
 In an effort to maintain Mr. Trump ’ s détente with Mr. Kim , the Pentagon will hold off on large-scale military exercise with South Korea this spring , though a limited version is still expected to go forward . Mr. Trump first suspended the military exercise after his initial meeting with Mr. Kim last year , surprising the Pentagon .
 Another angle : North Korean hacker kept up attack against European and American target last week even during the meeting , cybersecurity researcher said .
 If the French language ha a fortress , it is the imposing Académie Française , so exclusive that some of the greatest French writer have been turned away . Since the 17th century , member known a the Immortals have updated the definitive dictionary of French in an effort to protect the language against such ravage a the “ deadly snobbery of Anglo-American . ”
 But lately the academy ha struggled to fill vacancy , a paralysis that reflects France ’ s own struggle to adapt to the 21st century . “ We ’ re the reflection of the society , and it ’ s a society that ’ s questioning itself , ” one member said .
 Saudi Arabia : Walid Fitaihi , a U.S. citizen initially detained at the Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh a part of what the Saudi government ha billed a a crackdown on corruption , ha been imprisoned without any public charge or trial since 2017 . His friend say he ha also been tortured — including being shocked with electricity and whipped .
 Britain : Landlord check on a prospective tenant ’ s immigration status lead to racial discrimination and violate human right , a court found . The ruling wa a blow to Prime Minister Theresa May , who ha championed “ hostile environment ” policy to deter illegal immigration .
 China : The country ’ s vast detention program for Muslims ha required more and more police officer . Some of them are being recruited from the very ethnic group that are being targeted .
 Syria : The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons found “ reasonable ground ” that chlorine weapon were used in the assault on the town of Douma last year that killed 43 people . The U.S. and it ally blamed President Bashar al-Assad for the attack and launched punitive airstrikes against government target at the time .
 Turkey : A suburb made up of Disney-style chateau is no magic kingdom — it is unfinished , in bankruptcy and much criticized for it architecture — but the minicastles are still for sale .
 Chris Grayling : The political survival of Britain ’ s transport minister ha baffled many who accuse him of staggering incompetence , but his loyalty to Mrs. May ha protected him .
 Medicine : In the U.S. , a colossal battle is underway over the regulation of fecal transplant , a revolutionary procedure used to treat life-threatening problem .
 Jeff Bezos : For year , Amazon ’ s chief executive kept a low profile . But in recent week , his discreet , focused life ha become tangled in Hollywood ’ s gossip machine .
 Kidfluencers : Brands like Mattel and Crayola are striking lucrative deal with toddler and tweens with large social medium following ( some deal can fetch up to $ 50,000 ) .
 In memoriam : Zhores Alferov , a Russian physicist and committed communist who shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2000 for research that underpinned invention integral to modern life like solar cell and cellphone , ha died at 88 .
 Tips for a more fulfilling life .
 Recipe of the day : Start the week with a bracing , spicy dinner of vegetarian mapo tofu .
 If you have friend or loved one who are survivor of sexual abuse or assault , here are way you can help their recovery .
 Traveling while holding down a full-time job sound too good to be true . But it can be done .
 On Tuesday , the end of the woman ’ s ready-to-wear season in Paris , the last of Karl Lagerfeld ’ s enormous set for Chanel will be revealed — the final gesture of a man who shaped fashion a we know it . He died on Feb. 19 .
 Though many designer have created dramatic show — most notably Alexander McQueen , John Galliano when he headed his own brand and currently Thom Browne — none reached the extreme of Mr. Lagerfeld . He once imported ( and then returned ) a Swedish iceberg , had a rocket launch and created a sandy beach with real surf — all within the glass-roofed confines of the Grand Palais .
 Though I wa never a big a fan of these fantasy moment a many of my peer ( I believed the money could be better spent elsewhere , like on a charitable foundation ) , they were the marker of a time that is coming to a close , symbol of a vision that bridged the couture and Instagram era .
 Get ready for the farewell hurrah . Given that Mr. Lagerfeld never did anything by half measure , it is bound to be a doozy .

 The first skirmish have already been fought in what could turn into a tech cold war . “ The game is on , ” said the Netflix chief executive , Reed Hastings .
 By Edmund Lee
 Apple and Netflix , for better and for worse , have changed how we spend our leisure hour . In the process , the two company have upended old medium habit and created new one .
 Apple ’ s iPhones have already ported over big portion of people ’ s brain , and Netflix exploded TV time slot , creating the binge and the endless content screen . Where else can you find a soothing Japanese reality show like “ Terrace House ” and a Brechtian , mind-bending drama like “ Russian Doll ” in one place ?
 While setting the standard in their chosen area , Apple and Netflix have gotten along in the past , for the most part . But that period of peace between the two tech giant is about to change .
 On Monday , Apple will unveil it most ambitious medium project yet — a news and entertainment bundle that is likely to offer access to magazine , newspaper , music and , perhaps most intriguingly , original show and film . And when a tech giant like Apple jump into entertainment , it ’ s going to create wave .
 Famous for it teasing product demonstration , Apple will play host to Hollywood at it Cupertino , Calif. , campus so that it can show off what Reese Witherspoon , J.J. Abrams , M. Night Shyamalan and Steven Spielberg ( he of the recent Netflix-films-should-not-get-Oscars argument ) have done with the more than $ 1 billion the company ha laid out for it new ambition .
 The amount it ha spent on new material is nowhere near the $ 10 billion Netflix will plow into content this year , but Apple ha something Netflix doe not : more than a billion device all over the world , which amount to an infrastructure . That beat out the 139 million people worldwide who have subscribed to Netflix . If Apple is suddenly able to fill the screen of those device with it own content , a well a programming from other company it ha struck deal with , it will turn itself into a beast sure to put a scare into Netflix .
 The cordial relation between Apple and Netflix showed sign of fraying last November , when Netflix , led by Reed Hastings , stopped allowing people to sign up for it service through Apple ’ s iTunes store .
 Apple had been charging Netflix 15 percent on every sale , a blanket condition of being in the App Store . Now , new subscriber can still download the Netflix app on an Apple device , but they will be sent to an external website to submit payment detail . ( In the wonky world of internet transaction , where you make the purchase determines how , or if , Apple get a cut . )
 In a second sign of frayed relation between the two company , Netflix ha decided to opt out of the Apple bundle , which will upsell subscription to HBO and CBS in addition to it original programming . Netflix ’ s absence from the new platform say a lot about the state of play in the highly competitive streaming industry : a fight is brewing over how content is distributed .
 Mr. Hastings explained it at a Netflix event earlier this week : “ Apple ’ s a great company . We want to have people watch our service — or our content on our service . And so we ’ ve chosen not to integrate into their service , because we prefer to have our customer watch our content in our service . ”
 The key word here is “ service . ”
 Put it another way : Netflix is a service , or a pipe , that would sit on another service , or pipe , if it agreed to be included in the Apple bundle . And if it had joined force with Apple , Netflix also would have received little to no data about who is subscribing or watching it stuff . Further muddying the company ’ s identity , from the Netflix point of view , would be the fact that Apple user who spooled up “ Stranger Things ” or “ Orange Is the New Black ” may not be aware that they ’ re watching a Netflix show . Retaining the brand is a important a owning the data .
 Apple and Netflix ( and others ) are now in competition to become the main pipe for digital video — what television is fast becoming — and fixating on other contest , like who win the most Emmys , is secondary to owning the pipe . The company are battling for credit card number , email address and direct access to consumer .
 The focus on Apple ’ s programming make for a tantalizing narrative , given how long Silicon Valley in general and Apple in particular have remained agnostic about owning content . But original Apple fare , like the program set at a morning show starring Ms. Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston , is just the appetizer . The main draw is the bundle , the one-stop service for all kind of medium . Apple ’ s show are likely to be free for a period to entice user into other subscription , such a CBS and HBO and Starz , with Apple functioning a the reseller .
 But Netflix is also in the resale business . Although the company promotes it many “ original , ” it doesn ’ t actually own a lot of the show associated with the service . “ House of Cards ” and “ The Crown , ” to cite two example , are licensed .
 Netflix ’ s programming strategy is something of a mystery , because there isn ’ t a clear through-line on the show it buy or make , resulting in a hard-to-define hodgepodge . But that ’ s by design . Netflix ha long maintained that it brand isn ’ t about any particular aesthetic , like HBO ’ s . It ’ s a service that aim to serve up show for all kind of viewer , from people who like the teenage thriller “ You ” to those who are tempted to click on the tile for the dystopian Polish sci-fi show “ 1983 . ”
 The same might be said for Hulu , Amazon or Comcast , all of which fund original content while also marketing other content from channel — like HBO or CBS — within their platform .
 Not coincidentally , Comcast announced it own streaming bundle just day ahead of the Apple showcase . Customers who only have Comcast ’ s broadband service can spend an extra $ 5 a month to get free streaming movie and TV show from ad-supported service like Pluto and YouTube . They can also go through Comcast to purchase an HBO or a Netflix subscription . It ’ s meant to be a one-stop shop for your streaming need , not so different from what Apple is proposing .
 A nuance worth noting : Netflix is willing to work with Comcast — a competing distributor — and not with Apple because Netflix see Apple a the bigger threat . Netflix executive are worried the tech giant will crack the streaming code faster than Comcast , according to two people familiar with the company who were not authorized to talk publicly . Another way of putting it : Silicon Valley company are wary of what their next door neighbor are capable of .
 Netflix ha 60 million customer in the United States , making it one of the largest distributor in the country . Comcast , the nation ’ s largest cable company , ha 25 million broadband customer . Hulu ha 25 million . Amazon Prime ha 97 million , but not all are watching it video .
 Their reach is minuscule compared with Apple , which ha more than 1.4 billion device in use around the world , including more than 900 million iPhones . That scale explains how Apple Music , a streaming service the company started offering in 2015 , garnered more than 50 million paying user so quickly .
 It also explains why HBO ( owned by AT & T ) , Showtime , CBS and Starz could show up on Apple ’ s service Monday . The sheer volume of mobile device in circulation is hard to ignore . Even before it start offering original programming , Apple is arguably the biggest entertainment distributor on the planet .
 Still , HBO ’ s inclusion in the Apple bundle raise question . Its owner , AT & T , is already a large distributor , with roughly 160 million wireless customer . The company also plan to start it own streaming service — which will include HBO program and the property it gained through it acquisition of Warner Bros. , like “ Wonder Woman ” and “ Friends ” — by the end of the year .
 From HBO ’ s perspective , allowing itself to become part of Apple ’ s streaming effort is not that different from selling it ware via Comcast or DirecTV . It ’ s just another sale outlet . Even HBO ’ s own streaming service , HBO Now , had a slow start until Amazon Prime started marketing it . With the push from Amazon , the number of HBO Now subscriber nearly doubled , to five million . ( HBO currently ha more than seven million online customer , with those who subscribed through Amazon counting for a smaller proportion . )
 But that kind of indifference could cut against AT & T ’ s own plan to sell content directly to people . The wireless giant will have to weigh the value of the distribution muscle of Apple or Amazon or Hulu against it own need . Why did AT & T buy Time Warner ( which also included CNN , TNT and Warner Bros. ) if not to jump-start it own streaming bundle ?
 It ’ s worth noting that Apple is hyping it new service at a time when sale of it most lucrative product , the iPhone , have started to lag . It stopped reporting how many device it sold a of September . Now , it want investor to look at another line item — it foray into the medium business , which is stable and steadily growing . Apple hope it will grow even faster with the help of Hollywood .
 Interestingly , that line item ( listed a “ Services ” on the Apple income statement ) wa once little more than a balance-sheet curiosity . Now , it ’ s a $ 40 billion business . The forthcoming bundle could add more than $ 12 billion to that , according to an estimate from Goldman Sachs .
 For comparison , the entirety of the Walt Disney Company generated $ 59 billion in sale last year . CBS , $ 14 billion . Netflix , $ 16 billion .
 Without explicitly trying , Apple ha built itself into a medium colossus .
 So what doe mean for everyone else ?
 Mr. Hastings said it best on an October earnings call when he talked about the flurry of new entrant into his area of expertise : “ The game is on . ”

 Chicago — The list of thing born in this city includes the skyscraper , the Ferris wheel and ( supposedly ) brownie . And then there are it wonkier claim to fame .
 Chicago wa the crucible of 20th-century urban sociology . It wa also midwife to today ’ s boom in audio storytelling , thanks to “ This American Life , ” which originated here .
 Jeremy McCarter , the founder and executive producer of Make-Believe Association , a new nonprofit podcast production company , make no claim to inventing anything . But he ’ s hoping that the company ’ s first season , which made it debut this week , might usefully combine those last two Chicago creation .
 Each episode in the season , titled “ Grown Folks ’ Fables , ” feature an audioplay based on a traditional folktale representing one strand of Chicago ’ s cultural diversity , reinterpreted by a homegrown writer . The play are recorded live and presented along with excerpt from the post-show discussion among an audience carefully selected to reach beyond the usual theatergoer , who in this deeply divided city ( a elsewhere ) tend to run whiter , older and wealthier than the overall population .
 Make-Believe , a Mr. McCarter like to put it , is a podcast that ’ s “ one part live theater , one part TV production , one part social science . ”
 When it come to bridging social divide , he said recently over breakfast , “ story have an important role to play . ”
 Stories , of course , are also easier to come by than ever , thanks to the internet . The podcast universe is vast , and the biggest challenge for any new offering isn ’ t getting people talking , but simply being heard .
 But some important player in Chicago — where about 80 people turned out at the National Museum of Mexican Art to celebrate the release of Make-Believe ’ s first episode , “ Brava , ” a feminist update of a traditional Mexican tale — are already paying attention to Make-Believe ’ s model .
 “ We ’ re watching their evolution very closely , ” said Brian Bannon , the commissioner and chief executive of the Chicago Public Library , who attended two Make-Believe taping held at it flagship Harold Washington Library .
 “ Chicago ha a very close-knit , collaborative culture , ” Mr. Bannon added , noting that Make-Believe ’ s goal dovetail with the library ’ s own mission of engaging the broadest possible public . “ What Jeremy is doing is an example of a lot of really cool thing going on here . ”
 Mr. McCarter , 42 , who moved here from New York in 2014 , brings a résumé long on the civic engagement side of theater . He interned with Anna Deavere Smith after college , and more recently spent five year at the Public Theater , where he created the event series Public Forum . ( His wife , Julie Bosman , is a reporter for The New York Times . )
 He wa the co-author , with Lin-Manuel Miranda , of “ Hamilton : The Revolution , ” and last year published “ Young Radicals , ” a group portrait of five idealistic intellectual wrestling with the challenge to American democracy posed by World War I .
 Mr. McCarter ’ s approach to audio storytelling similarly mix idealism and high-flown intellectual scaffolding . As an “ overture ” to Make-Believe ’ s first season , he posted an interview about the power of story with the star Harvard philosopher Michael Sandel .
 Describing Make-Believe , he weave in reference to the work of the political scientist Robert Putnam ( the author of “ Bowling Alone ” ) , the social critic Jane Jacobs and the philosopher John Dewey — a Chicagoan , he ’ s quick to note .
 “ Grown Folks ’ Fables ” is also 100 percent local , starting with a core writing team of up-and-coming collaborator . ( The first season , whose budget Mr. McCarter described a running into the low six figure , is sponsored by the Poetry Foundation . )
 First onboard wa Nate Marshall , 29 , a South Side-born poet and editor who wa commissioned to reinterpret the African-American folktale of Brer Rabbit , the trickster figure who wa sanitized in Disney ’ s gauzy plantation reverie “ Song of the South. ” ( Mr. Marshall ’ s title : “ Bruh Rabbit . ” )
 Next Mr. McCarter recruited Nancy Garcia Loza , 35 , a producer-turned-playwright with family root in Jalisco , Mexico , who wrote “ Brava , ” based on a traditional Jalisco tale featuring a dragon-slaying heroine . Ms. Garcia Loza also wrote an original corrido , a traditional Mexican ballad form , which wa performed by an all-female mariachi band .
 Mr. Marshall and Ms. Garcia Loza had never met . They and Mr. McCarter spent six month developing the play in the writer ’ room : in this case , a space at The Den , a hub of Chicago ’ s storefront theater scene . The first rule : Drafts would only be read out loud , not circulated in print .
 “ Some of my theater friend were surprised by that , ” Ms. Garcia Loza said . “ But you learn so much by just hearing it . ”
 Mr. McCarter also had skin in the game . The third episode feature his adaptation of Zachary Mason ’ s novel “ The Lost Books of the Odyssey , ” which imago 44 variation on the story of Odysseus . ( Mr. McCarter settled for five . )
 The fourth , which ha yet to be recorded , is an outlier : a presentation of “ What Use Are Flowers ? ” — a little-known dystopian short play by Lorraine Hansberry ( another Chicagoan ) , written for television in 1961 . Subtitled “ a fable , ” it asks whether humanity , if nearly wiped out in a cataclysmic war , would be worth salvaging . ( The episode , to be released biweekly , are about an hour : a roughly 40-minute audioplay , plus audience discussion . )
 Mr. Marshall , also a co-organizer of the annual Chicago Poetry Block Party , said that it took a while for Make-Believe ’ s approach to storytelling to take shape . But where the show would be taped ( non-theater space , they decided ) and “ how the audience is built and invited into the space wa something we talked about from the very beginning , ” he said .
 Daniel Kyri , 25 , an actor , director and filmmaker who is directing the Hansberry play , grew up in the Jackson Park neighborhood on the South Side . He ha performed at the city ’ s most prestigious theater ( the Goodman , Steppenwolf , Lookingglass ) , a well a in his own crowd-funded web series , “ The T ” ( created with Bea Cordelia ) , which explores queer and transgender friendship across Chicago ’ s divide of race , class and geography .
 The first time he ever interacted with a white person , Mr. Kyri recalled , wa when he wa 9 , on a school field trip .
 “ Chicago is multiple city , ” he said . “ The discourse becomes more authentic when you can bridge — let ’ s call it what it is — segregation . ”
 During the post-show discussion of “ Bruh Rabbit , ” Mr. Marshall ’ s mother talked about the “ invisible line ” on Rainbow Beach , a public beach in the South Shore neighborhood , where , in 1961 , white attacked an interracial group staging a “ freedom wade-in . ”
 The excerpt from audience discussion included with “ Brava ” emphasize how Latina woman in the audience identified with it heroine . But the experience also stirred some different jolt of recognition .
 “ There were people there who hadn ’ t heard a radio play since they left Mexico , ” Ms. Garcia Loza said . “ They recognized this kind of oral tradition . ”
 After “ The Lost Books of the Odyssey , ” the conversation gravitated in a different direction : toward the placeless place of the internet , and the way social medium allows u to act out different identity , different self , different story .
 Mr. McCarter hope Make-Believe ’ s story will get people who find them online talking too .
 “ We want to open up a space and try to get people to travel an imaginative distance together , ” he said .

 The 15 or 20 minute before the performance ticked by the same way they do on night when Rome Neal presides over jazz at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe on the Lower East Side of Manhattan . But this time Mr. Neal wa directing a reading of a play . It take aim at the sensation that is the theatrical juggernaut “ Hamilton ” and it creator , Lin-Manuel Miranda .
 So this wa different from the jazz night . There wa no music , in contrast to the rap-infused lyric of “ Hamilton , ” one of the biggest critical and commercial success in Broadway history .
 The play , “ The Haunting of Lin-Manuel Miranda , ” wa written by Ishmael Reed , 80 , a prolific and often satirical writer who , a a critic reviewing one of his book once said , “ ha made member of every constituency angry ” during his long career .
 Mr. Reed ’ s most recent work should prove to be no exception .
 “ The Haunting of Lin-Manuel Miranda ” target “ Hamilton , ” the play , and “ Hamilton , ” the best-selling biography by Ron Chernow , which inspired Mr. Miranda . The program handed out at the reading said , “ The Haunting of Lin-Manuel Miranda ” wa “ about a playwright who is misled by a historian of white history into believing that Alexander Hamilton wa an abolitionist . ”
 “ He take no prisoner , ” Mr. Neal said of Mr. Reed , who wa awarded a MacArthur fellowship in 1998 . Mr. Miranda also received a MacArthur , in 2015 . ( The fellowship are often referred to a genius grant . )
 In “ The Haunting , ” there is a character named Lin-Manuel Miranda who is visited by ghost . They help Mr. Reed accomplish his main goal , which he said in an interview wa “ to give the voice that were left out of the musical some speaking line . ”
 But Mr. Reed also wrote in some dig at Mr. Miranda . Midway through “ The Haunting , ” a character say he expected Mr. Miranda to be “ busy rehearsing for his role in ‘ Mary Poppins. ’ ” ( Mr. Miranda play a London lamplighter in “ Mary Poppins Returns , ” the Disney sequel to the beloved 1964 movie-musical . )
 “ By directing it , I wa standing up for Ishmael Reed ’ s work , ” said Mr. Neal , who ha directed eight of Mr. Reed ’ s play . “ He right wrong with his play . He brings light or understanding to the situation that ’ s going on . ”
 Mr. Miranda wa in Puerto Rico last week for a three-week run of “ Hamilton , ” and a publicist for the show said he wa unavailable to talk about “ The Haunting. ” Another publicist connected with “ Hamilton ” said that Mr. Chernow would not answer question that had been sent by email .
 But Mr. Neal said he believed that Mr. Miranda wa aware of the reading , because he had sent Mr. Miranda a direct tweet and also a flier . Mr. Neal said he had not received a reply from Mr. Miranda .
 The issue raised in “ The Haunting of Lin-Manuel Miranda ” involve question that scholar have debated about “ Hamilton ” — “ Ishmael Reed revives an old debate ” wa part of the headline on an article about the reading on The New Yorker ’ s website . Among some historian , the discussion ha touched on whether Mr. Miranda ’ s play — which moved from the Public Theater to Broadway in 2015 — overstated Alexander Hamilton ’ s opposition to slavery and whether it devoted enough attention to other , le appealing element of Hamilton ’ s legacy , such a arguing that the president should be more like a monarch and that senator should serve life term .
 Last year , for example , Rutgers University Press published “ Historians on Hamilton : How a Blockbuster Musical Is Restaging America ’ s Past , ” with chapter by 15 scholar who look at how Mr. Miranda ’ s play ha changed the general public ’ s perspective about colonial history .
 Mr. Chernow ’ s book wa widely praised for it portrayal of one of the Founding Fathers when it wa published . The historian Edmund S. Morgan called it “ a superb study ” of someone who had a voice in the new nation but “ who wa himself uncertain of who he wa and of what he and his colleague did . ”
 Toward the end of the book , Mr. Chernow called Hamilton “ a fervent abolitionist. ” Earlier , he wrote , “ Few , if any , other founding father opposed slavery more consistently or toiled harder to eradicate it than Hamilton — a fact that belies the historical stereotype that he cared only for the rich and privileged . ”
 “ The Haunting of Lin-Manuel Miranda ” treat Hamilton and slavery far differently .
 “ Probably Ishmael is right . ‘ Hamilton ’ ha been given a free pas or there ’ s been an exaggeration of Hamilton ’ s antislavery , ” said Eric Foner , a professor emeritus of history at Columbia University . “ It ’ s a legitimate outlook that he ha . It ’ s not the only outlook , but it ’ s within the realm of legitimacy . ”
 Alexander Hamilton “ did not like slavery , there is no question about that , ” Professor Foner said . But he added that antislavery “ wa low down on Hamilton ’ s list of priority compared to other thing , ” including “ uniting this nation , which required compromise on slavery . ”
 Economic development , another Hamilton priority , wa also complicated by slavery . “ He wasn ’ t interested in disrupting the plantation economy of the South , which wa producing a lot of the wealth of the country . ”
 Professor Foner , who said he had seen “ Hamilton ” but did not attend one of the reading of “ The Haunting , ” also mentioned Hamilton ’ s own ambition . “ He married into a slave-owning family , ” he said . “ That ’ s where the money wa , people who owned slave . ”
 Lyra D. Monteiro , an assistant professor of history at Rutgers University , Newark , who wrote one of the chapter in “ Historians on Hamilton , ” said “ The Haunting ” wa “ entirely correct to bring attention ” to Hamilton and slavery .
 “ The Haunting ” also imagined conversation between Mr. Miranda and Native Americans — “ Chernow doesn ’ t even mention u , ” a Native American character declares . Professor Monteiro said the history of Native Americans wa “ even more erased in our imagination than slavery is . ”
 When the time came for the reading , Mr. Reed wa in the cast , playing the role of Mr. Miranda ’ s agent in imagined conversation about celebrity endorsement and , in Act 2 , an offer to write a musical about Christopher Columbus , a heroic figure discredited in recent decade by those who say his voyage opened the way to the destruction of native culture and the importation of slave .
 Mr. Neal said he had not seen “ Hamilton ” or read Mr. Chernow ’ s book . He said he had not gone to “ Hamilton ” even though Jasmine Cephas Jones , the actress who originated the role of Peggy Schuyler and Maria Reynolds , had appeared at one of his jazz show at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe .
 “ I didn ’ t see it at the Public Theater , ” he said of “ Hamilton. ” And when it went to Broadway , he said , “ I just didn ’ t want to spend that kind of money . I try to get people to come into the Nuyorican Poets Cafe for $ 15 , $ 20 . I admire Broadway production , but not out of my pocket at this point . ”
 Money for the reading came from Mr. Reed — $ 5,000 , he said . “ That ’ s like lunch money for the investor in ‘ Hamilton. ’ This is a David-against-Goliath effort . ”
 Now Mr. Reed and Mr. Neal are trying to raise $ 50,000 ( Mr. Reed said they already had $ 20,000 ) toward a staged version at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe in May . “ It ’ s going to be marvtastic , ” Mr. Neal said . “ It ’ s going to be marvelous and fantastic . ”
 “ The Haunting ” end with the Miranda character promising to give away money he made from “ Hamilton ” in the future to organization in New York like Medgar Evers College . ( The production in Puerto Rico is a fund-raiser for a Miranda family effort to support Puerto Rican artist a the island continues to recover from the devastation of Hurricane Maria . )
 “ That ’ s not likely at all , but he could have remorse , ” Mr. Neal said . “ But it ’ s water under the bridge . Now it ’ s time for Ishmael Reed to have his say . ”

 What happens when the creative heart and soul of a studio retires ? If it ’ s Hayao Miyazaki , the studio shutter with him .
 Not long after the legendary anime director , now 78 , announced in 2013 that he wa calling it quits ( not his first time ) , his movie home , Studio Ghibli , halted production , ending it three-decade run with two Oscar-nominated film , “ The Tale of the Princess Kaguya ” and “ When Marnie Was There. ” The news left animation fan across the globe wondering if the maker of such beloved film a “ Princess Mononoke ” and “ Spirited Away ” would ever release another feature .
 The decision also raised other question . Could Miyazaki — one of the world ’ s most ambitious and tireless director — actually stay retired ? And what would all those other creative mind at the studio do ?
 For the Ghibli producer Yoshiaki Nishimura ( “ Princess Kaguya ” ) the answer wa simple , at least in theory . He would create his own studio , pulling some of the top talent from Ghibli ’ s deep stable of feature film animator .
 The result is Studio Ponoc , which began life in 2015 in Kichijoji , a neighborhood in western Tokyo that ’ s home to the Ghibli Museum and a major center for Japanese animation . Despite a tough start — low budget and a reported staff of “ two to three ” — Ponoc quickly expanded it work force to more than 400 .
 The studio ’ s first feature , “ Mary and the Witch ’ s Flower , ” wa a hit , becoming one of Japan ’ s biggest box-office draw in 2017 . Its second , “ Modest Heroes , ” wa released in the United States on Thursday , Jan. 10 .
 The transition looked pretty seamless until Miyazaki announced in 2017 that — surprise ! — he wa coming out of retirement to direct one more feature . Theories abounded : he wanted to create one more film for his grandson ( the Ghibli producer Toshio Suzuki ’ s explanation ) . The master wa lured back by the sweet promise of computer animation ( a revealed in the 2016 documentary “ Never-Ending Man : Hayao Miyazaki ” ) . He got tired of hearing up-and-coming animator dubbed the “ new Miyazaki . ”
 [ All of Studio Ghibli ’ s film , ranked . ]
 “ Honestly , I think Miyazaki isn ’ t Miyazaki unless he ’ s creating something , ” Susan Napier , author of “ Anime : From Akira to Princess Mononoke ” and “ Miyazakiworld : A Life in Art , ” said . She added : “ That ’ s where he is alive . He love to create and imagine . ”
 What looked like an ending became something else — the continuing tale of two studio , one rising and going unexpected place , one resurrected and returning to it focus on a revered filmmaker , all set against the backdrop of a Japanese animation industry thriving a never before . ( The 2016 box-office smash “ Your Name ” brought in $ 350 million to become the highest-grossing anime feature of all time . )
 If Ponoc ’ s first movie , “ Mary and the Witch ’ s Flower , ” had element in common with a previous Ghibli classic , 1989 ’ s “ Kiki ’ s Delivery Service ” ( the young female witch protagonist , the black cat familiar , the broom-borne aerobatics ) , it second , “ Modest Heroes , ” is something else entirely . First , it ’ s not a feature at all , but a collection of short , a format that Ghibli would never release in commercial theater . If you want to see , say , “ Mr . Dough and the Egg Princess ” or “ Water Spider Monmon , ” there ’ s only one theater in the world where you can see them .
 “ Studio Ghibli doe create short film for exhibition at the Ghibli Museum , ” Nishimura said . “ But these are all designed and planned by director Hayao Miyazaki . Other creator are not able to realize their plan . ”
 With “ Modest Heroes , ” some of those same artist are making short meant to be seen outside of a museum setting , and directing their own work for the first time .
 In “ Kanini & Kanino , ” the Academy Award-nominated director Hiromasa Yonebayashi ( “ The Secret World of Arrietty ” ) tell the story of two crab brother who encounter menacing minnow and stampeding raccoon ( the crab boy are very , very small ) on a quest to save their dad . In “ Life Ain ’ t Gon na Lose , ” the animator and first-time director Yoshiyuki Momose ( “ Spirited Away ” ) find high drama in a young boy ’ s life-threatening food allergy ( fried egg and squeeze-bottle mayo have never looked so fearsome ) .
 And in “ Invisible , ” Akihiko Yamashita ( “ Mary and the Witch ’ s Flower ” ) tell the story of a guy who becomes the unlikeliest of animated action hero . “ ‘ Invisible , ’ with it motif of an invisible man , took on the considerable challenge of using hand-drawn animation to draw what is essentially undrawable , ” Nishimura said .
 The Ponoc film are a major departure from two of Ghibli ’ s most recent work : “ The Wind Rises ” ended with the hero losing his young wife to tuberculosis ; “ The Tale of the Princess Kaguya ” with the heroine leaving her earthborn parent to return to her home on the moon .
 “ Many of the story we created at Studio Ghibli a the studio wa winding down were about separation , ” Yonebayashi , the director , said . “ But a we started production anew at our new studio , we turned away from story of separation to story about coexistence and encounter . ”
 “ Modest Heroes ” wa initially envisioned a four film , with the director and Ghibli co-founder Isao Takahata contributing a seven-minute segment based on a story from the Japanese epic “ Heike Monogatari. ” But that project wa canceled when Takahata died in 2018 at 82 . Nishimura worked with the director during the last 10 year of his life , and said he wa inspired to join Ghibli after seeing Takahata ’ s critically acclaimed “ Grave of the Fireflies ” a a young boy . “ When Isao Takahata died , I cried like I have never cried before , and I felt like a part of me had been chipped off from the shock , ” he said . “ Modest Heroes ” end with a dedication to him .
 Studio Ponoc is in the midst of planning another short film and several feature-length one ; Studio Ghibli ’ s next film , “ How Do You Live ? , ” based on a 1937 fantasy novel by Genzaburo Yoshino , is slated to open in 2020 or 2021 . The current boom in Japanese animation ha led to a shortage of capable animator , a major issue in an industry notorious for it often breakneck work schedule . “ Some people I met who had worked with Miyazaki on ‘ Princess Mononoke ’ are still traumatized by it , ” Napier said . “ Miyazaki himself acknowledged it . He used the term ‘ boro boro , ’ which mean ‘ crumbling. ’ They really rode people to the limit there . ”
 Ponoc felt the pressure early on . “ There wa always a group of talented staff member on ‘ standby ’ from the beginning of production of director Hayao Miyazaki ’ s film at Studio Ghibli , ” Yonebayashi said . “ With ‘ Mary , ’ we had to start from scratch , with no one . ”
 In addition to releasing both of Ponoc ’ s film in the United States , the distributor GKids also hold the North American theatrical right to Studio Ghibli ’ s classic ( right acquired from Disney in 2011 ) . If the star align , GKids could release a Ponoc film and Miyazaki ’ s latest “ last ” film at the same time . “ Of course we would love to get ” the Miyazaki film , the GKids president , Dave Jesteadt , said . “ That would be a huge honor . But separate from the business side , I ’ m just very excited to see it , just like any other fan . ”
 And the prospect of Ghibli and Ponoc making film at the same time ? “ It wa unexpected , ” Jesteadt said . “ Although maybe not so much in hindsight ? There have been multiple time that Miyazaki ha retired and unretired . But I think that while there ’ s great fellowship and a lot of shared animator and talent between those studio , it ’ s also great for both company to have a little artistic competition . There ’ s always room for more great film . ”

 Whenever there is a plane or major highway crash , federal investigator descend immediately to the scene to collect evidence . Their goal is to find the accident ’ s cause so that future tragedy can be prevented .
 But during the 35-day government shutdown , the National Transportation Safety Board furloughed all but a handful of it 400 staff member . And investigation into at least 18 fatal accident in the United States that normally would have meant sending expert to the scene were not begun , according to the agency .
 Only now are investigator who returned to work this week beginning to examine the accident , which led to at least 32 death . And some expert fear that crucial evidence ha been lost .
 “ Trying to go back after the fact and reconstruct all the fact , element and circumstance will be very difficult , or impossible , ” said Greg Feith , a former senior air safety investigator at the agency who is now a private consultant .
 Most of the accident were crash of small plane , like one that plunged into Chickamauga Lake , Tenn. , on Jan. 7 , killing the pilot , Frank Davey , and sole passenger , Lynda Marinello .
 Ms. Marinello ’ s husband , Chris , a pilot for 20 year , said he feared that once the safety board wa finally able to examine the wreckage , it would default to a finding of “ pilot error ” because evidence supporting other cause might have been spoiled with no one from the agency there to safeguard it .
 In an interview , Mr. Marinello said that Mr. Davey wa a good pilot , and that three camera were recovered from the wreckage that could yield clear evidence of what brought the plane down . But he worry the information on the camera may be badly degraded .
 “ If the N.T.S.B . guy would have been on the scene , they would have understood the importance of getting those SIM card to Washington or to some facility that had the ability to get the data , ” he said . He say he ha asked but ha not been told where the card are , or whether they are locked with other wreckage in storage .
 While safety board member are appointed by the president , it is an independent federal agency . The potential impairment of so many investigation ha prompted some air-safety expert to question why the agency did not keep more investigator working in the United States , even a some were taken off furlough to help with crash in other country .
 Those included the October crash of Lion Air Flight 610 , a Boeing 737 that plunged into the Java Sea shortly after takeoff , killing all 189 on board .
 [ Behind the Lion Air crash , a trail of decision kept pilot in the dark . ]
 “ Who made the decision that the board is going to perform some of it function , but not others ? ” asked Jim Hall , who wa chairman of the safety board during the 1990s , when he said he kept investigator working during government shutdown .
 Mr. Hall added , “ The fact of the matter is that if you are not able to respond , you have weakened the investigation . ”
 Just how much ha been lost is not clear . The safety board declined to characterize which investigation had been most impaired by passage of time and spoilage of evidence .
 A spokesman , Christopher O ’ Neil , said the agency “ closely followed ” guidance from the federal Office of Personnel Management during the shutdown .
 Under the law , Mr. O ’ Neil said in an email , staff member “ could only be recalled to investigate an accident if their work wa necessary to prevent imminent loss of life or significant property damage . ”
 He said agency official assessed every accident reported during the shutdown . Only two — the failure in late December of a United States-manufactured engine on a South Korean airliner , and the continuing inquiry into the Lion Air crash — met the threshold for recalling furloughed investigator .
 But the agency concedes that investigator may never visit some accident site , and opportunity to learn thing that could prevent tragedy have been missed .
 “ Important evidence wa lost that we would normally examine following an accident , ” Mr. O ’ Neil said in a statement . That , he added , “ potentially could prevent determination of probable cause . ”
 Another accident not investigated during the shutdown wa a fiery multivehicle highway crash in Florida on Jan. 3 that killed five child headed to Walt Disney World , and two others . An eight-member team is being dispatched , the agency said on Wednesday .
 In addition , the agency did not gather evidence needed to determine whether investigation were warranted in five other highway , railroad and pipeline accident that left eight more people dead .
 Federal investigator returning to their job in many case will have to rely on information collected by local law enforcement , whose evidence gathering may not be a precise or granular .
 And a lot is simply lost , too , by not being able to see the disaster firsthand , and how wreckage wa strewn about .
 Examples of important but highly perishable evidence include the distance between propeller mark in the snow or mud — which help estimate an aircraft ’ s speed at impact — or chunk of ice shaped like a leading edge , which tell investigator that ice may have been on a wing .
 By now , Mr. Feith said , at many crash site the wreckage will have been hoisted onto truck , often after being cut into piece , and shipped to storage facility .
 There , agency investigator will sift through the piece , not always knowing which fracture and fatigue happened before the crash , which were caused by the crash , and which were caused by moving the wreckage afterward .
 “ They may not be able to decipher what is an artifact of the accident , versus what is an artifact of the post-accident recovery , ” Mr. Feith said .
 Moreover , another key evidence collection — request for air traffic control data normally made quickly after a crash — may not be possible in some case . “ A lot of that information is lost in the abyss , ” he said .
 The significance of getting investigator to accident site speedily is underscored by how the safety agency organizes it inquiry : A “ Go Team ” of rotating expert fly immediately to the most significant crash site . They are on call 24 hour a day , with a bag of audio recorder , camera , flashlight , screwdriver , wrench or other tool at the ready .
 “ The importance of being on site a soon a possible is why the agency is structured the way it is , ” said Mr. Hall , the former agency chairman .
 It is not only the physical evidence that fade or break down , he added .
 “ Individuals ’ memory further away from the event can be le than certain than what might have been , had they been interviewed a soon a the event occurred , ” he said .
 The shutdown also may have slowed some investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration — including an inquiry into a Jan. 21 near miss above a heavily populated neighborhood of Oakland , Calif .
 During the mishap , which ha not been previously reported but wa confirmed by the F.A.A. , two single-engine plane came within 100 to 200 foot of each other , the two pilot said in interview . The Oakland control tower mistakenly instructed them to fly at the same altitude even a they flew toward each other , the pilot said .
 “ I wa shocked by how close he wa , ” one pilot , Isaac Reynolds , said of the other aircraft . “ We very easily could have hit each other . ”
 An F.A.A . spokesman , Ian Gregor , said the Oakland control tower filed a report about the near miss on the day it occurred , and that it wa investigated the next day .
 But Mr. Reynolds said he wa never contacted . And the other pilot , who requested to remain anonymous because he did not want his family to know about the near miss , said when he called the airport to report the incident after landing , he wa told the investigation would be slower because of the shutdown .
 “ They said thing were slower than usual because the person who would investigate wa on furlough , ” the pilot said . “ I ’ m not trying to throw anyone under the bus , but I do think that shutdown matter . Whether or not this contributed or not it ’ s hard to say , specifically . But it ’ s certainly not helping safety . ”

 Robert Greenblatt is a theater junkie . He keep a piano in his office . He wa an investor in “ Hamilton. ” He helped usher in an era of live musical on the broadcast network . And he ’ s friend with Dolly Parton .
 As of Monday , he is also the executive charged with the formidable task of bringing HBO into a more digital future without it Emmy-winning series “ Game of Thrones ” or “ Veep , ” both of which will end their run in the coming month .
 Mr. Greenblatt , 58 , wa named the chairman of entertainment at AT & T ’ s Warner Media , giving him oversight of TBS , TNT , a future streaming service and — the crown jewel — HBO . Thanks to a reorganization brought about by the veteran AT & T executive John Stankey , Mr. Greenblatt ha become one of the most powerful player in the industry .
 “ There are only a few thing I wanted to do , ” he said in a telephone interview . “ These opportunity in these kind of job aren ’ t open that often . ”
 Mr. Greenblatt , who go by Bob , wa the beneficiary of corporate change signaling that AT & T will not be a passive overseer of the medium empire it acquired last June for $ 85.4 billion . He spent much of the last two decade a the head of entertainment at Showtime and NBC , and his expertise make sense for a company that is looking to increase it output while trying to hang on to is core fan .
 His first big assignment will be to remake the structure that wa in place in the year when HBO , TBS and TNT were owned by Time Warner , under which HBO operated independently .
 The overarching goal is to produce enough quality content to make the new incarnation of AT & T — with it planned streaming service front and center — a fearsome competitor to the deep-pocketed tech company Netflix , Amazon , Hulu and Apple . Don ’ t forget the Walt Disney Company , which ha plan to enter the digital fray in a substantial fashion , thanks , in part , to the trove of content it acquired with it purchase of the bulk of 21st Century Fox for $ 71.3 billion .
 And Mr. Greenblatt will become the caretaker of something dear to those who have spent their Sunday night glued to “ Sex and the City , ” “ The Sopranos ” and “ Game of Thrones ” : HBO . The network ’ s chief executive , Richard Plepler , who had spent 27 year at the network , the last six at it head , announced his resignation last week .
 Mr. Greenblatt noted that he wa not some wildly out-of-the-box pick . “ I ’ m not a much a an outsider that could have been brought in , ” he said . “ I don ’ t want to just come in and upend everything and destroy what they ’ ve built . ”
 Mr. Greenblatt said he wa approached by Mr. Stankey , the longtime AT & T executive and Warner Media chief executive , last fall , not long after he had stepped down from NBC . Talks accelerated in January .
 “ I wa immediately excited about it , ” he said . “ Though not undaunted by it . You know from my history I like a challenge . ”
 A meaningful change will come about in short order : HBO ’ s center of gravity will shift from New York , Mr. Plepler ’ s base of operation , to Los Angeles , where Mr. Greenblatt built his career .
 He dreamed of being in show business when he wa growing up in Rockford , Ill. , about 90 mile from Chicago . “ Literally in the cornfield , ” Mr. Greenblatt said . He set his sight on becoming a producer when he saw “ That ’ s Entertainment ! ” , the 1974 film filled with clip from classic MGM musical . But he had no connection : His father worked on air-conditioners and heating system , and his mother wa a travel agent .
 Oddly , the Catholic high school he attended — “ He ’ s definitely got to be the only Catholic Robert Greenblatt in the world , ” Ms. Parton said when she presented him an award in 2011 — wa a musical-theater training ground . His classmate included Joe Mantello , who went on to be a Broadway director , and the musical star Marin Mazzie , who died last year .
 After piling up degree at the University of Illinois , the University of Wisconsin and the University of Southern California , Mr. Greenblatt landed a job at the Lorimar studio in the late 1980s . That wa where he worked with Peter Chernin , the executive and producer who would play a role in virtually every turn of his career in the year to come .
 “ Peter is my ultimate mentor , my uber mentor , ” Mr. Greenblatt said .
 Mr. Chernin left Lorimar for a new TV network — Fox — and persuaded Mr. Greenblatt to join him . The timing wa impeccable . Fox wa entering it go-go ’ 90 phase , with addictive soap like “ Beverly Hills 90210 ” and “ Melrose Place ” and the family drama “ Party of Five. ” Mr. Greenblatt also helped put “ The X-Files ” on the air , despite his initial hesitation .
 He decided to strike out on his own a a producer in the late 1990s , forming a studio with the producer David Janollari — with financial backing from 20th Century Fox , thanks to Mr. Chernin . In that role , he squired a few network show and had a critically acclaimed hit with “ Six Feet Under , ” Alan Ball ’ s darkly comic funeral-home series . It lasted five season on HBO and won the Golden Globe for best television drama in 2002 .
 “ I felt the HBO glow way back then , ” Mr. Greenblatt said .
 He rejoined the executive rank at Showtime , where Mr. Chernin had worked in the 1980s . “ When I wa at Showtime we were , of course , in the shadow of HBO , ” Mr. Greenblatt said .
 At the time , HBO wa known for gritty , male antihero like Tony Soprano . Showtime went in a slightly different direction under Mr. Greenblatt , programming show like “ Weeds ” with Mary Louise-Parker and “ Nurse Jackie ” with Edie Falco . A personal favorite for Mr. Greenblatt wa “ Dexter , ” starring the former “ Six Feet Under ” star Michael C. Hall . Showtime became a serious home for original programming on his watch , with the number of subscriber rising to 19 million , a 52 percent jump over his tenure there .
 In 2010 , a NBC wa trying to recover from the decision to replace it 10 p.m. drama with a nightly Jay Leno talk show , Comcast wa closing on it purchase of NBC Universal . When Comcast executive were looking for a new entertainment head , Mr. Chernin suggested his protégé .
 Mr. Greenblatt orchestrated a turnaround at NBC , taking it from last place to first among viewer 18 to 49 year old , who are prized by advertiser . At the network , he followed the strategy that he ha relied on throughout his career : find a difference-maker . At Fox , it wa programming teen-friendly soap when no one else wa doing them . At Showtime , it wa a new twist on the antihero . At NBC , it wa “ The Voice , ” the uplifting hug-in of a show that struck a new note in a genre dominated by the acerbic “ American Idol. ” And it wa not such a big jump from the heartwarming quality of “ The Voice ” to the unapologetically emotional NBC hit “ This Is Us . ”
 Mr. Greenblatt also made live musical an unexpected force on broadcast television , with NBC ’ s production of “ The Sound of Music , ” “ The Wiz , ” “ Hairspray ” and “ Jesus Christ Superstar , ” a winner of five Emmys . And he showed off his musical chop at an NBC presentation for advertiser , accompanying Ms. Parton on piano for a performance of her song “ I Will Always Love You . ”
 When Mr. Greenblatt left the network last September , he had his piano — an 1898 Steinway grand , with ivory key , which he bought at age 20 — moved from his NBC office to his home . But he wasn ’ t through with show business , saying at the time that he would love to run a company . Once again , his mentor stepped in .
 Mr. Chernin had a relationship with Mr. Stankey and AT & T ’ s chief executive , Randall Stephenson , having worked with them on a joint venture called Otter Media , a company AT & T bought last year .
 “ I know he had conversation with John and Randall about me over the last six month or so , ” Mr. Greenblatt said . ( Mr. Chernin declined to comment for this story . )
 Now that he ha the big job , the work begin . Mr. Greenblatt gave HBO ’ s programming president , Casey Bloys , a vote of confidence , saying he ha done an “ extraordinary job. ” He also pledged to be a “ friend to the creative programmer . ”
 “ Nothing is more exciting to me than , ‘ Who ’ s directing ? Who ’ s doing it ? ’ ” Mr. Greenblatt said . “ All of that is very exciting to me , and I have no doubt I ’ ll be plugged into all of that . ”
 Mr. Bloys announced last month that HBO would begin rolling out programming on Monday night , an example of the network ’ s expanded slate and beefed-up budget . Will that plan continue ?
 “ The Monday night thing , I haven ’ t thought much about , ” Mr. Greenblatt said . “ The scheduling of these network are always tricky , le so in the modern age , with streaming platform and watching thing when you want . There ’ s probably too much programming for Sunday , and maybe Monday make sense . ”
 In his new role , Mr. Greenblatt will split his time between HBO ’ s office in Santa Monica and the Turner Broadcasting office in Burbank . For the time being , he said , the piano will stay at home .

 Q . How can teacher , librarian and parent use this challenge ?
 A . Through the year , adult have told u over and over that participating in this contest ha made their student both more aware of and more interested in what ’ s going on in the world . Many see it a a low-stakes way to help teenager start building a news-reading habit .
 If that ’ s not enough of a reason to assign it , our contest is also an easy way to add more nonfiction to your student ’ reading list — and to encourage teenager to make their own choice about what to read , a anything published in The Times in 2019 is fair game .
 Participating also meet the recommendation given in this joint statement on independent reading given by the International Reading Association , the National Council of Teachers of English , and the Canadian Children ’ s Book Centre .
 But maybe the most compelling reason to assign this contest is what student themselves say about it . Reflecting on participating in 2017 , a teenager named Emma Weber , from London , told u :
 Prior to this summer , the only writing I did wa for school assignment or Google search . And if I did get around to it , I never reread what I wrote . That ’ s why , a the week went on , I surprised myself when I began double and triple checking my comment for mistake , of which there were far more than expected !
 Another transformation is my newfound interest in the news . I used to be the kind of person who opened a newspaper and went straight to the puzzle section , and though that may be unchanged , I now feel compelled to read a few article that catch my eye too . In return , exposing myself to current affair ha fine-tuned my political opinion , and through consistent writing I learned to express them in a way that accentuates them .
 The result ? I feel grounded in my view and understand what ’ s going on in the world . It ’ s amazing what a change 1,500 character a week make .
 Thank you for making this contest a hit year after year , and please spread the word that it ’ s back for it tenth season .
 Good luck !

 How ha an enclave for emo kid and mall goth resisted the retail apocalypse ? With merch .
 By Paula Mejía
 On a recent afternoon , the Hot Topic store at the King of Prussia Mall , outside of Philadelphia , teemed with teenager , 20-somethings and stroller-pushing parent . The shopper sifted through rack of “ Harry Potter ” plush doll , “ Riverdale ” sweater and “ Kiki ’ s Delivery Service ” jewelry , seeking the perfect physical manifestation of their — or their child ’ s — fandom .
 Demitri Benton , 19 , of Reading , Pa. , had come to browse the shop ’ s “ Deadpool ” offering . “ It ’ s usually the first or maybe second place I come to , ” he said . “ It ha so many thing that you probably wouldn ’ t be able to find in any other store a far a , like , anime , video game , TV show . ”
 Former mall goth , punk and emo kid may remember the store differently . In the ’ 90 and early aught , one did not so much enter a descend into Hot Topic . The suburban shopping center staple wa dungeonlike , with hellish gate that led shopper into a dark commercial corridor .
 Inside , a wall of T-shirts emblazoned with the name of rock band and irreverent saying wa flanked by pile of studded belt and rubber bracelet . Manic Panic hair dye could be purchased in a wide range of parent-infuriating hue . Often the shopping experience wa set to a blaring soundtrack of Nine Inch Nails and My Chemical Romance ( whose frontman — fun fact — once worked at Hot Topic ) .
 The massive T-shirt display is still there , and so is much of the infernal darkness . “ Literally I have seen people run to the door , and their parent steer them away and say , ‘ They worship Satan , we can ’ t go in there , ’ ” said Alexis Monkiewicz , a key holder at the King of Prussia location .
 But these day , the store known for inciting parental panic is also home to a dizzying array of obsession . There ’ s merch for die-hard fan of BTS , Billie Eilish and Black Sabbath stocked alongside collectible designed for those who love My Little Pony , Care Bears and the Disney princess . They ’ ve even turned the light up a bit .
 Though Hot Topic ha not publicly disclosed it financials since the private equity firm Sycamore Partners acquired it in June 2013 for about $ 600 million , the brand ’ s endurance in the narrowing market of junior apparel suggests that the brighter , broader inventory is selling . ( Sycamore Partners declined to comment for this article . )
 The company ’ s sustained brick-and-mortar presence may also indicate it health amid report of record-high mall vacancy and closure . Hot Topic currently operates 676 store in the United States and Canada , up from 662 location in 2014 , in addition to an online store where one can buy good from hundred of entertainment franchise .
 In a 2018 report , the youth marketing research firm YPulse found that Gen Z and millennial shopper deemed Hot Topic the top retail destination for “ unique style , ” with Nike coming in second .
 “ What Hot Topic ha managed to do really amazingly — and quietly — is to pivot their product and their brand perception to cater to the next generation and what they ’ re most interested in , ” said MaryLeigh Bliss , the vice president of content at Ypulse . “ They have completely kept up with what young consumer want . ”
 Steve Vranes , the C.E.O . of Hot Topic since June 2016 , said that he had watched the company ’ s evolution “ from afar ” through his work in retail before he joined the company . His résumé includes the child ’ s clothier Gymboree and Urbio , a design company that manufacture vertical garden .
 “ I knew it had changed a little bit and had gone from being considered solely a more of a goth brand to really evolving to be a much broader set of product over time , ” Mr. Vranes said . “ It ’ s kind of organically continued to change all the time , and I think that ’ s part of why we ’ re successful . We continue to question every single year , ‘ What do customer want that they ’ re not getting anywhere else ? ’ ”
 What they want , it seems , is merch , and Hot Topic ha plenty . According to a company representative , more than 75 percent of Hot Topic ’ s product are the result of agreement with intellectual property owner , including record label and entertainment studio , to license their official merchandise .
 That mean you can buy an Ariana Grande “ Sweetener ” T-shirt on the artist ’ s website , if you want . Or you can buy it on hottopic.com , where you won ’ t get a digital album download with your purchase , but you ’ ll spend le money .
 Hot Topic ha always been home to affordable fan gear . Orv and LeAnn Madden , who started the store out of their Southern California garage in October 1989 , sold “ The Nightmare Before Christmas ” stocking and “ South Park ” sticker when those franchise had but nascent fandom .
 Hot Topic wa also among the first youth retailer to offer plus-size option , which sold so well that the company started a plus-size label , Torrid , in 2001 . Seeing a growth opportunity , Sycamore Partners spun off Torrid into it own company in 2015 . ( Such investment have been key to Sycamore ’ s success — and caused the ire of some interested party . Hot Topic Inc. bondholder sued Sycamore in 2017 for what they described a an “ insider scheme ” to profit from the company ’ s “ crown jewel . ” )
 Hot Topic ’ s wholesale catering to fan likely began around 2004 , said Ed Labay , the vice president of merchandise . That wa the year “ Napoleon Dynamite ” became a cultural phenomenon — Hot Topic ’ s “ Vote for Pedro ” T-shirts flew off the shelf — and when , Mr. Labay said , “ we really started to see these pop culture moment hit in a much bigger way than I think they ever had before . ”
 The company experienced another surge in 2008 , when “ Twilight ” fan were treated with in-store event and merchandise around the first film ’ s release .
 But even Edward Cullen couldn ’ t inoculate Hot Topic against the retail apocalypse that ha roiled physical store and shopping center since the Great Recession . That same year , the company announced a music discovery platform , ShockHound , which never took off and cost the company at least $ 3 million . In late 2010 , The Los Angeles Times reported on a financial dip at Hot Topic that led to staff cut and store closure .
 “ Hot Topic wa not immune to the broader consumer spending slowdown during the recession , ” Mr. Vranes said .
 Ultimately those loss were cause to think bigger , not smaller . In 2012 , Hot Topic began a partnership with Her Universe , a woman ’ s wear company for “ fangirls , ” then acquired it in 2016 .
 In 2015 , Hot Topic Inc. founded BoxLunch , another chain offering licensed and unlicensed fan merchandise . The brand also established a presence at Comic-Con in San Diego , Los Angeles and New York . For year , Hot Topic ha been a sponsor of a “ geek couture ” fashion show at San Diego ’ s Comic-Con with Her Universe .
 The company still relies heavily on in-store sale . In a recent credit analysis , Moody ’ s projected that Hot Topic would see “ modest ” revenue growth in 2019 , in part from the uptick in it e-commerce sector , it reasonable price ( the average cost per item is $ 12 ) and the promotional surge surrounding big-ticket movie release .
 The expansion of Hot Topic ’ s mandate ha helped keep the company afloat in an uncertain retail landscape . It is also evocative of a cultural shift : Now people can be a part of many fan community , even seemingly divergent one , and be taken seriously .
 “ When we were in our early teen , you had to label yourself a something . You were a punk , or a jock , or you listened to hip-hop . That wa your whole identity , ” said T.J. Petracca , a founder of the roving party Emo Nite , which license some of it merchandise to Hot Topic .
 These day , he said , “ if you like Drake , you can also like Panic ! at the Disco . There ’ s not a much separation a there used to be . ”
 The specific density of object and apparel within the store conveys that , too . Mr. Labay likened Hot Topic ’ s layout to the inside of “ a teen ’ s mind , ” or a constantly updating social medium feed .
 Mr. Vranes said that the store “ is a reflection of all of the change from a content perspective , and all of the access that fan have to these different property and band and artist and shows. ” ( His fandom of choice is “ Game of Thrones . ” )
 The internet , especially Tumblr , ha helped bring these world together . It ha also changed the meaning of community for fan across the pop culture spectrum .
 The ability to connect over the internet , said Susan Kresnicka , who run the business anthropology firm Kresnicka Research & Insights , changed “ what made you feel like an outsider and slightly abnormal in a previous era ” into a mean of connecting with other obsessed fan .
 “ If you can go online and find that there are people all over this world that are fan of this one little idiosyncratic television show that you happen to love with all your heart , you don ’ t feel quite so weird or not mainstream yourself , ” Ms. Kresnicka said .
 For teenager who don ’ t have the money to attend concert or Comic-Con , and particularly for those who don ’ t live in urban area , Hot Topic ’ s store function a critical meeting place .
 “ The presence of Hot Topic in mall is related to the presence of convention , ” said Louisa Stein , an associate professor of film and medium culture at Middlebury College . “ There ’ s a place you can go and kind of have your fan identity acknowledged in physical space and see other fan in that space with you . ”
 The company also frequently hold contest where people can submit T-shirt design for movie and TV merch . The winner ’ artwork are sold in store nationwide .
 The conversation between fan and Hot Topic can be highly specific . In the fall of 2018 , the retailer caused a stir by listing a T-shirt on it website a “ Destiel ” : a portmanteau of two “ Supernatural ” character , Dean and Castiel , whose onscreen chemistry is the subject of much fan fiction , a well a contention .
 ( The dedication of the “ Supernatural ” fandom is largely what ha kept the show on the air for 14 season despite poor rating , and the show ’ s writer have been known to make cheeky reference to fan theory in script . “ Supernatural ” is now set to end after it 15th season . )
 Hot Topic wa seen to be taking a side in the dispute by naming the shirt Destiel , and fan feverishly discussed whether the show would pursue a more explicit Destiel story line , said Rachel Aparicio , a medium and gender study scholar at Kresnicka Research & Insights , and a “ Supernatural ” fan herself .
 “ It definitely signaled a shift to me in watching how the company is engaging with fandom , and doing it at a level that is very insider with something like that , ” she said .
 To wit : On one “ Supernatural ” episode , Castiel buy a younger character a plush toy and say , “ I got it at the Hot Topical. ” Hot Topic then began selling shirt that read : “ I got it at the Hot Topical. ” ( Hot Topic ha since pulled the Destiel shirt . When asked , Mr. Labay said he “ can not confirm or deny ” that he know anything about it . )
 Some may call it a niche reference . But for fan , that ’ s the whole point .

 Given the actor ’ s long history in show business and political cause , it is all the more baffling to friend that he would risk so much .

 CHICAGO — Ever since he wa a child actor growing up in a show-business family , Jussie Smollett ’ s life blended activism with the make-believe world of television and movie .
 As he got his early break in a television mini-series and Disney ’ s 1992 hockey comedy “ The Mighty Ducks , ” and did press junket for a short-lived ABC sitcom starring him and his five sibling , Mr. Smollett wa also steeped in cause like AIDS activism and ending apartheid . He spoke of his mother ’ s closeness with the Black Panthers and prominent civil-rights leader , and how she had encouraged Mr. Smollett and his brother and sister to create art and live out their belief .
 But now , fantasy and politics have collided in a way that ha upended everything Mr. Smollett worked for . He is facing prison time and widespread public scorn over accusation that he concocted and carried out a false attack with racist and anti-gay detail , capitalizing on broader anxiety about hate crime under President Trump .
 Given his long history in show business , it is all the more baffling to friend and associate that Mr. Smollett , who is black and openly gay , would risk so much on a story that seems to have crumbled under intense scrutiny by police investigator .
 The Chicago police say that Mr. Smollett had been upset over his salary and wanted to stir up publicity when he filed a police report saying that two masked men had beaten him and thrown a noose around his neck a he walked home at 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 , in the wealthy Streeterville neighborhood of downtown Chicago .
 According to police and court record , Mr. Smollett staged the attack a if he were a director putting on his first play . He paid two brother who had worked on “ Empire ” $ 3,500 , asked them to buy ski mask and a noose to use a prop and told them which epithet to hurl when they attacked him . The police say Mr. Smollett even scoped out neighborhood security camera to ensure the assault would be recorded .
 Mr. Smollett ’ s lawyer say he is innocent , but his career now hang in doubt after “ Empire ” executive producer wrote him off the season ’ s final two episode , and his tale of hatred and racism ha instead become a cultural brawl over deception and “ fake news . ”
 The Hollywood friend who rallied behind Mr. Smollett the loudest are now struggling with where to place their allegiance — with their outspoken friend Jussie , or with the Chicago Police Department , an agency long criticized for it treatment of black people . In this case , though , the police laid out an unusually expansive and detailed timeline that appears to undermine Mr. Smollett ’ s claim .
 “ I stand with Jussie , under the principle that he is family to me , and he ’ s always stood for me , ” said Ralph Harris , who starred with Mr. Smollett and Mr. Smollett ’ s five sibling on a short-lived 1994 ABC sitcom , “ On Our Own , ” about orphaned child trying to stay together by outwitting the authority .
 “ But I ’ m a realist , and I respect law , and I respect what I ’ ve been seeing and hearing a well of the investigation — although Chicago doe have it reputation , ” Mr. Harris added . “ But what I say in that case is if this is something that he ’ s responsible for , I stand by him — because then we need to get him help . ”
 Conservatives who had publicly doubted the story from the start seized on the criminal charge against Mr. Smollett a evidence that the news medium and liberal would credulously run with any narrative that tarnished Mr. Trump and his supporter .
 Democratic politician and liberal supporter of Mr. Smollett who had called the assault a modern-day lynching and an example of the rise in hate crime since Mr. Trump ’ s election are now grappling with feeling of shock , anger , confusion and shame . Activists worry that victim of hate crime will now face greater skepticism , or might not report future crime at all .
 “ Jussie Smollett understood this moment , and understood the heightened sensitivity to hate , to racism , to homophobia , and sought to manipulate it to his own benefit , ” said David Axelrod , who covered Chicago politics a a journalist long before becoming a top adviser to President Barack Obama .
 For Mr. Smollett , art and activism were intertwined throughout his childhood .
 His parent met while campaigning for civil right in the Bay Area of California , and his mother had worked with the founder of the Black Panthers and prominent civil-rights leader , according to a New York Times interview with Mr. Smollett in 2016 . Between child-acting gig and press junket that the six sibling did for their 1994 ABC sitcom , their mother , Janet Smollett , made sure the child played sport and read about figure like Malcolm X and Langston Hughes , she told The Los Angeles Times in 1994 . ( His family did not respond to phone or email message . )
 “ I know their mother , Janet , ha always taught them to stand up for themselves , and for what they believe , ” Mr. Harris said . “ They seemed like they were beyond their year . ”
 Mr. Smollett embraced social movement . He worked for Artists for a New South Africa . He served on the board of director of the Black AIDS Institute , and grew outspoken a Black Lives Matter took shape . In 2017 , Mr. Smollett released a politically charged single , “ F.U.W. , ” a sort of resistance anthem with a black-and-white video taking aim at the Trump administration and white male privilege .
 His breakout role wa Jamal Lyon , a talented member of the “ Empire ” hip-hop dynasty who struggle to get his family to accept that he is gay .
 When Mr. Smollett learned that the show ’ s creator Lee Daniels wa casting the role , he sent a direct message to Mr. Daniels saying that he sang , acted , danced and wrote music , Mr. Smollett told Entertainment Weekly . Mr. Smollett said he had promised Mr. Daniels that “ I am Jamal Lyon in more way than one. ” He got an audition , and he got the part .
 Mr. Smollett reportedly earned between $ 65,000 and $ 100,000 per episode , and had not previously raised objection about his salary to Fox , which broadcast the show , people familiar with the show have told The Times .
 But the Chicago police superintendent , Eddie T. Johnson , said that Mr. Smollett had been dissatisfied with the money he wa making and decided to do something about it .
 On Jan. 25 , Mr. Smollett sent a text message to a friend , Abimbola Osundairo , who had worked a a stand-in for the love interest of Mr. Smollett ’ s “ Empire ” character . Mr. Smollett had befriended and worked out with Mr. Osundairo , a bodybuilder and former college football player , and that morning , Mr. Smollett had a mission in mind , according to court document .
 “ Might need your help on the low , ” he texted . “ You around to meet up and talk face to face ? ”
 As the two men drove around Chicago together , Mr. Smollett said he wa dissatisfied with how the “ Empire ” studio had responded to a threatening letter he said he had received on Jan. 22 at the Chicago facility where the show film . The letter wa laced with a powder — determined to be crushed ibuprofen — and said “ Smollett Jussie you will die black , ” followed by an anti-gay slur , according to prosecutor . It ha been turned over to the F.B.I .
 Superintendent Johnson later said at a news conference that Mr. Smollett had actually sent the letter to himself a a way to get attention .
 According to prosecutor , Mr. Smollett told Mr. Osundairo that he wanted to stage an attack on himself and cast him and his older brother , Olabinjo , who had been an extra on “ Empire. ” The brother are of Nigerian descent , but were born in the United States .
 The Osundairos — who go by Abel and Ola — were struggling financially on the outer edge of show business . They had each declared bankruptcy in September 2016 and had been weighed down by credit-card debt and student loan .
 The brother lived together in a small apartment on a busy boulevard on Chicago ’ s North Side , and had been trying to develop business venture that married physical fitness , entertainment and their religious faith . John King Johnson , a friend , described them a “ inseparable . ”
 “ They have always had an acting dream and it seems like it ha grown over the year , ” said Devin Allen , another friend who played college football with the brother at Quincy University in southwestern Illinois . Referring to Olabinjo , whom he wa closer to , he said : “ Nobody is perfect . Nobody ha a spotless past . He wa temporarily overcome at the time with whatever he wa tempted with , like money . ”
 After Mr. Smollett reported the attack , investigator painstakingly used security-camera footage and record from taxi cab and a rideshare to identify the brother and track their movement that freezing cold night . They were detained and questioned by the police , but have not been charged and are acting a cooperating witness in the case .
 Across Chicago , the whipsawing anger wa still raw for observer who watched Mr. Smollett walk silently out of court this week and disappear into a dark-windowed SUV .
 “ I ’ m disgusted , ” said Ja ’ Mal Green , a community organizer on Chicago ’ s South Side , who offered prayer of support for Mr. Smollett on the day that news of the attack broke . “ Those of u who wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt , who wanted to listen and support him , it push u up against the wall . ”

 LOS ANGELES — “ Green Book , ” about a white chauffeur and his black client in segregation-era America , won best picture and two other trophy at the 91st Academy Awards , overcoming a series of awards-season setback and mixed critical notice .
 In honoring “ Green Book , ” voter slowed the rise of Netflix , which had aggressively pushed “ Roma ” in the best-picture race . Netflix made significant inroad , however , with “ Roma , ” about a domestic worker in 1970s-era Mexico City , winning three Oscars , including best director and cinematographer for Alfonso Cuarón . ( Netflix had previously received only one Oscar for a feature-length film . )
 [ Here ’ s the full list of winner . ]

 A gobsmacked Colman gave a giggling , circuitous acceptance speech that nonetheless managed to address the elephant in the room — that her victory had denied one to Glenn Close ( “ The Wife ” ) , who had been expected to break her seven-nomination losing streak .
 “ This is not how I wanted it to be , ” Colman said , a the camera cut to Close in the audience . Close smiled and offered a c ’ est la vie shrug .
 Spike Lee wa not a sanguine . When “ Green Book ” won best picture , he made a disgusted gesture and started walking out of the theater a “ Green Book ” producer gave their speech . Backstage , Lee said , “ No comment , ” when asked about the coronation of “ Green Book , ” which detractor complain ha a retrograde view of race .
 Lee then added , “ I thought I wa courtside at the Garden and the ref made a bad call . ”
 In a major shift from the # OscarsSoWhite year of 2015 and 2016 , this year ’ s ceremony , which lasted a little over three hour , wa notable for the diversity of honoree . Two “ Black Panther ” crew member , Hannah Beachler ( production design ) and Ruth E. Carter ( costume ) , became the first African-Americans to receive Oscars in their respective category . Cuarón received the prize for best cinematography for “ Roma , ” making him the first director to win for shooting his own film .

 Asian-Americans were represented in the victory of “ Free Solo , ” which wa named best documentary . ( “ Bao , ” which won best animated short , wa made by a Canadian filmmaker of Asian descent . ) L.G.B.T . people were acknowledged with “ Bohemian Rhapsody .
 “ We made a film about a gay man , an immigrant , who lived his life just unapologetically himself , ” Malek said . “ We ’ re longing for story like this . ”
 And Lee ( “ BlacKkKlansman ” ) won a competitive Oscar for the first time in his celebrated career — albeit for writing and not directing . It wa the lone award for the film . “ Let ’ s all mobilize , ” Lee shouted , referencing the coming presidential election a he accepted the adapted screenplay award . “ Make the moral choice between love versus hate . Let ’ s do the right thing ! ”
 “ Green Book ” also won best original screenplay . It wa written by Nick Vallelonga , Brian Currie and Peter Farrelly . Vallelonga , who wrote the book on which the film wa based , thanked his parent . Farrelly thanked his cast , agent , publicist , production executive , family and the entire state of Rhode Island .
 “ Shallow , ” the duet between Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper that serf a the centerpiece of “ A Star Is Born , ” won best song . The film came up short during much of the award season , but “ Shallow ” proved irresistible to voter .
 And the Oscar for best Academy Awards host go to … nobody !
 The original plan , of course , wa for the comedian Kevin Hart to preside over Sunday night ’ s award , until he wa dropped for his history of homophobic tweet . So instead of a comedian delivering a monologue , there wa a mini-medley from Queen — whose original singer , Freddie Mercury , wa celebrated in “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” fronted by the former “ American Idol ” contestant Adam Lambert .
 So began this hostless , in-a-hurry Oscars , itself a longtime institution moving forward and putting on a show without the public face it started with .
 And a it turn out , Hart — or whoever might have replaced him — wa hardly missed .

 The show took it lead from the Grammys , opening with a rowdy rendition of “ We Will Rock You ” by Queen .
 “ Welcome to the Oscars ! ” shouted Adam Lambert , who ha taken over for Mercury a Queen ’ s frontman in recent year , a a waterfall of spark fell to the Dolby Theater stage .
 Tina Fey , Amy Poehler and Maya Rudolph then took the stage and — while explaining they were not the host — gave a mini-performance that drew relaxed laughter from the audience and seemed to make the case that the three woman should be hired to co-host next year , pronto . In a quick segue , they began presenting the Oscar for best supporting actress at the show ’ s eight-minute mark . Last year , it took the show 18 minute just to get through Jimmy Kimmel ’ s monologue .
 Regina King won the supporting actress trophy for her role in the lyrical art film “ If Beale Street Could Talk . ”
 “ I ’ m an example of what it look like when support and love is poured into someone , ” King said , composing herself after breaking into tear .
 Two subsequent award also found African-American woman called to the stage . Carter , a three-time nominee ( “ Amistad , ” “ Malcolm X ” ) , won best costume design for her Afro-futuristic “ Black Panther ” attire . Beachler made history herself for her work ( with Jay Hart ) .
 “ When you think it ’ s impossible , just remember to say this , ” Beachler said , reading off her phone during an emotional speech . “ I did my best , and my best is good enough . ”
 The film also won for Ludwig Goransson ’ s score .
 “ Roma ” won best foreign-language film .
 “ Free Solo , ” about a daring rock climber , took the prize for documentary feature .
 “ Thank you National Geographic for believing in u , and for hiring woman and people of color , ” said one of it director , Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi .

 The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences had pressed the producer of this year ’ s ceremony to drastically reduce the running time . Last year , the Oscars stretched to almost four hour — beyond the endurance of viewer , with rating dropping to a record low . In one abandoned plan , the academy wanted to award four Oscars , including hair and makeup , during the commercial break , with the winning moment edited and aired later in the broadcast .

 Perhaps a a protest , intentional or not , the three winner for hair and makeup , honored for their work on “ Vice , ” took their time at the microphone . In an awkward and halting set of thank yous , they fumbled with a piece of paper containing name and went way over their allotted 90-second time . Producers started the playoff music and ultimately cut sound to the microphone .
 Notably , none of the winner from “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” thanked Bryan Singer , who wa fired a the film ’ s director because of erratic behavior on the set and ha been dogged by sexual misconduct allegation .
 The first win for “ Green Book ” wa a supporting actor victory by Mahershala Ali . It wa Ali ’ s second supporting actor win in recent year . ( He previously won in 2017 for his role in “ Moonlight. ” ) Ali became the second African-American man to win two Oscars for acting , joining Denzel Washington .
 “ I want to dedicate this to my grandmother , who ha been in my ear my entire life telling me that if at first I don ’ t succeed , try , try again , ” Ali said from the stage .
 “ Spider-Man : Into the Spider-Verse ” won best animated feature for Sony Pictures , a expected . The win wa a blow to Disney and it Pixar studio , which have dominated the category since it creation in 2001 and had two nominee this year , “ Incredibles 2 ” and “ Ralph Breaks the Internet . ”
 Peter Ramsey , one of the three-credited “ Spider-Verse ” director , spoke about the importance of inclusion in animated film . “ We see you , we ’ re powerful , ” he said to fan who identified with the diverse character in the film .
 Pixar did not leave empty-handed , thanks to it win for “ Bao , ” conceived and directed by Domee Shi . Even the space-race thriller “ First Man ” picked up an award , for visual effect .
 [ Spike Lee won an Oscar . Here ’ s his passionate speech . ]
 An earlier version of this article misstated the ancestry of the filmmaker of “ Bao. ” The filmmaker is a Canadian of Asian descent ; she is not an Asian-American .

 On Comedy
 By Jason Zinoman
 Are you obsessed ?
 The comic Catherine Cohen , 27 , frequently asks her audience this question , and the way she swan around the stage tell you she find the answer self-evident .
 To be fair , Cohen ha earned a pretty obsessed following in part because of her finely sharpened first impression , that of a preposterously preening , rigorously self-regarding , sexually arrogant diva in Lululemon legging . But it ’ s when she start singing that her act deepens , and joke about buffoonish bravado segue into one about vulnerability and delusion . “ Boys never wanted to kiss me , so now I do comedy , ” she sings , smiling . It ’ s her thesis statement of a song , and the refrain “ Look at me . Look at me . Look at me . Look at me ! ” is accompanied by Norma Desmond eye and hustling footwork .
 Cohen is part of a resurgence of young comic making joke you can hum , the latest to join a long tradition that includes star from Steve Martin to Weird Al Yankovic . These day , comic are singing almost every night of the week at intimate space like Union Hall , Caveat and Club Cumming , packed with the kind of 20-something audience that New York theater ha long courted ( mostly unsuccessfully ) .
 Frequent program like “ Pop Show , ” with the charismatic host Ziwe Fumudoh , dedicated to original comic song , regularly draw crowd ; and traditional cabaret venue like Don ’ t Tell Mama in Times Square have recently started weekend stand-up night accompanied by a piano player .
 In her finest tune , Cohen dream aloud about leaving the city for an ideal life upstate . It begin meditatively mundane ( “ Think of the Instagrams I ’ d take/Think of the four page of a novel I ’ d read/upstate ” ) . Then she speed up , dancing furiously , a she spiral into a yearning moan about the joy of apple picking . Only in song doe she reveal the true insecurity of her character , the comic desperation of someone whose boasting hide some conventional aspiration : getting a boyfriend and living in Beacon , which in her fevered fantasy are related .
 Some of the popularity of these artist , who still fall under the hopelessly vague yet somehow enduring term of alternative comedy , may be a function of the decline of contemporary musical comedy . If you ’ re a musically inclined comedian who grew up in the past few decade , you are more likely to have laughed at work from Flight of the Conchords or the Lonely Island than at a Broadway show .
 Many of these young performer appear to be artistic descendant of “ Our Hit Parade , ” the defunct downtown showcase where dynamic artist like Erin Markey , Cole Escola and Bridget Everett blended comedy , cabaret and the pop chart . Its end in 2012 left a vacuum that ha been filled by comedy . Neal Medlyn , one of the founder of that influential show , performs in the outlandish persona of the pink onesie-wearing rapper Champagne Jerry , and at a recent performance at Joe ’ s Pub , he paused to ask of his own evening : “ Is it a comedy show ? Is it a music show ? Is it a tractor pull ? ”
 Younger performer are more likely to just call themselves comic . Larry Owens , a dynamo who appeared later in this show , is a good example . He studied drama and improvisation at the Steppenwolf Theater Company in Chicago and is well versed in Stephen Sondheim . But at the moment , you are most likely to see him on a bill of stand-ups . ( This may change in May , when he star a an aspiring artist in the new musical “ A Strange Loop ” at Playwrights Horizons . )
 While Cohen ’ s act is more like a musical that break into song when the character need to express something more emotional , Owens is at his best when he quickly jump right into a song . Of all the comedian who sing , he ha the most virtuosic voice , a powerful , nimble instrument that can inject a cover of the “ Fresh Prince of Bel-Air ” theme with an ominous intensity or imbue a ballad to Oprah Winfrey with the kind of gravitas that could make you weep .
 The pianist Henry Koperski is the connective tissue for many of the artist in this scene , including Owens and Cohen , whom he writes music for and play alongside on Wednesdays at Club Cumming in the East Village .
 On a recent Wednesday , when Cohen wa performing at Joe ’ s Pub , Matt Rogers , who also work with Koperski , substituted for her , asking the Club Cumming crowd stuffed into it long hallway of a space : “ Any straight people in the audience ? ” When a few woman shouted , he responded wryly : “ No , this is like 1912 . Women don ’ t count. ” Then the room went quiet . “ If you ’ re a straight , that ’ s O.K. , ” he said . “ Some of my best friend are straight . ”
 He delivered a velvety-voiced , soulful breakup tune about his love for Disney World that is the funniest tribute to Orlando since “ The Book of Mormon. ” His song lean on a strong premise with a twist , but end not with a hard joke , but on a delicate emotional note .
 At the same show , Marcia Belsky , who ha written a musical version of “ The Handmaid ’ s Tale ” set in 2028 Brooklyn , sang about how annoying it is when rich people get really into nature . “ Don ’ t stress because deep down we ’ re all animal , ” she sang , describing a dialogue with a wealthy man . “ Yes , but you ’ re an animal who owns a yacht . ”
 Take away the music , and these song could be turned into stand-up bit , though not a funny . When the joke lean on an exaggerated reaction to the ordinary , it help to have some dramatic note to belt out .
 Musical comedy may be even more popular among artist who work online since comic song tend to go viral faster than joke told at a microphone , which may be why musical segment Leslie Jones ’ s tribute to the Upper East Side last week are a integral to the mix of sketch on “ Saturday Night Live ” a ever . It ’ s also why so many musical comedian work online . Demi Adejuyigbe , an inventive writer for “ The Late Late Show With James Corden , ” post pop-culture spoof , including a spot-on Childish Gambino and an annual and increasingly elaborate re-edit of the Earth , Wind & Fire song “ September . ”
 But the artist who capture the low-rent spirit of early Bo Burnham video best is Matt Buechele , who ha a gift for spotting and lampooning musical clichés in only a few second at his keyboard . His impression reflect a perceptive ear , whether for that moment in a musical right before the romantic couple break out into song or how movie remix their hit song for the end credit .
 Improv comedy ha not been immune to this trend . Baby Wants Candy , a musical juggernaut that started in the late 1990s , now ha permanent show in Los Angeles , Chicago and New York . Its alumnus have also started their own company , including North Coast , a hip-hop improv troupe that mount a “ Hamilton ” -inspired show called “ Anybody ” at Caveat that tell the story of a historical figure . But the most impressive improvised musical I have seen is “ Your Love , Our Musical , ” also at Caveat , a double act in which Rebecca Vigil and Evan Kaufman interview a couple from the audience and turn their romantic origin story into a fluidly structured , tuneful show .
 On the night I attended , the artist were lucky enough to find a couple who met at a rationalist association and began a polyamorous relationship . And yet , a fertile material a this may be , part of the reason crowd roar at these show is undeniably the perceived level of difficulty . If you think improvising an entire show seems like a magic trick , doing it with a full band and joke that rhyme is like making the Statue of Liberty disappear .

 ATLANTA — After the N.F.L. ’ s best season in year , Roger Goodell , the league ’ s commissioner , got his chance to crow on Wednesday afternoon ahead of it showcase event .
 “ This season ha demonstrated that there ha never been a better time to be a part of the N.F.L. , ” Goodell said . “ Our game is getting better and better , and our engagement and popularity is unmatched in today ’ s medium landscape . ”
 Under Goodell , the N.F.L . ha tried to be everywhere all the time . The combine , the draft and the minicamps have become manufactured event unto themselves ; there are now game on Thursday night and some , played in London , early on Sunday morning ; and most game have remained on network television even a other sport have largely moved their game to cable and now streaming .
 A year ago , the strategy wa under stress . Then the emergence of a new crop of young star and a largely controversy-free season combined to drive up television rating and produce a spectacular weekend of conference championship , capping a winning streak that began with a surprisingly fervent auction for right to the league ’ s least popular slate of game .
 Coming off the 2017 season , after television rating had dropped 17 percent over the previous two year , the league entered the medium market trying to sell the right to “ Thursday Night Football. ” CBS and NBC had both said they lost money showing Thursday game , and they weren ’ t willing to pay much more than the $ 450 million combined they were paying each year .
 Then , a in 1993 , when an audacious bid for N.F.L . right ignited a scramble that sent their value soaring , Rupert Murdoch came to the rescue . Fox agreed to pay $ 660 million annually to show “ Thursday Night Football . ”
 Murdoch ’ s market-resetting bid came shortly after he agreed to sell the vast majority of his empire to Disney , leaving him with a significant need for marquee programming on his network . Also , there wa real competition from a tech company .
 Brian Rolapp , the N.F.L. ’ s chief medium and business officer , said in an interview in September that Fox did not submit the highest bid . A tech company did , he said , though he would not reveal which one .
 “ We turned down higher bid , ” he said . “ When you put a game exclusively on digital , are you growing the distribution and availability , or are you limiting it , and to the extent how much ? And for u , we weren ’ t sure we wanted to do that yet . ”
 In other word , the N.F.L . stuck to it foundational game plan to be everywhere and accessible . After two season of turmoil , the league opted not to break away from it longstanding strategy , but instead doubled down on it .
 Plenty of danger still lurk . Football ’ s concussion crisis threatens the viability of youth football . Colin Kaepernick ’ s collusion case against the league drag on , suggesting he ha a chance to win , and attendance wa down to it lowest level in eight season . Instead of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady or Rams Coach Sean McVay , the biggest topic ahead of the Super Bowl remains atrocious officiating . The league ’ s collective bargaining agreement with it player expires in two year , and negotiation will be tough .
 But Rolapp ’ s big bet paid off . Every time slot for N.F.L . game , including Thursday night ’ s , earned higher television rating this season , a total gain of 5 percent .
 Incidents of violence against woman continued to plague the league . The Kansas City Chiefs cut the Pro Bowl running back Kareem Hunt during the season after video showed him shoving and kicking a woman . The New York Times later reported that the N.F.L . failed to question Hunt about the incident during an interview earlier in the year .
 The San Francisco 49ers cut Reuben Foster after his second arrest on domestic violence charge in 2018 , and three day later he wa claimed by Washington , a move that garnered substantial criticism . TMZ also published video of Washington safety Montae Nicholson punching out a man .
 But Goodell and the N.F.L . limited their unforced error . There wa nothing like the drawn-out legal battle over deflated football in 2015 and 2016 . And once the N.F.L . realized the opposition it would face if it pushed ahead with a rule mandating player on the field to stand during the national anthem , the league backed off .
 Young player like Patrick Mahomes , Baker Mayfield , Mitchell Trubisky and Saquon Barkley became star in 2018 , pointing the way to a post-Brady world . High-profile quarterback like Russell Wilson and Andrew Luck returned to form . High-octane passing offense took over the league .
 It all came together in the conference championship game , which featured the four highest seed and the four highest-scoring team . Two veteran quarterback , Drew Brees and Brady , took on the best young quarterback , Jared Goff and Mahomes , in high-scoring shootout that went to overtime .
 David Berson , the president of CBS Sports , which will televise the Super Bowl on Sunday , said fewer off-the-field story were getting attention “ because the on-field product is so compelling. ” Whether Berson is correct or whether the league simply had a year with fewer controversy ultimately doe not matter all that much to the league ’ s medium partner because , a Berson put it , “ The focus is on the football , and the football is really exciting . ”
 There were blown call and rule controversy , of course . The N.F.C . championship game hinged on an egregious no-call , and Brady and the Patriots also benefited from a questionable ruling and a rule that did not allow Mahomes — probably the league ’ s most valuable player — to get his hand on the football in overtime . But the argument garnered more attention for the game , which wa just what the league wanted .
 The question now is whether this fundamentally violent sport can be made safer . Before the season , the N.F.L . introduced a rule barring player from using their helmet a weapon when tackling . Six week into the season , it enforcement wa essentially abandoned , underscoring how difficult it is to legislate between acceptable and unacceptable level of violence .
 According to league statistic , concussion were down 29 percent in 2018 , to 0.5 per game from 0.7 . Jeff Miller , the N.F.L. ’ s executive vice president for health and safety , cautioned on a recent conference call that “ there is no finishing line ” when it come to player safety , but touted the work being done to get player to wear better helmet and to present team with targeted intervention to prevent concussion .
 The league ’ s own concussion data show that the number of concussion each year fluctuates , and that previous reduction were reversed in following season . The N.F.L . ha also not been able to reduce the instance of A.C.L . and M.C.L . tear , ligament injury that commonly end player ’ season .
 The youth tackle football participation rate ha been dropping for a decade , and now the high school tackle football participation rate is declining , too . Just one insurance company is willing to cover professional football league for head trauma , according to ESPN , and youth football league and school district are facing insurance premium that they are struggling to afford .
 In the off-season , the N.F.L . is likely to receive a ruling in the Kaepernick collusion case . His grievance , which wa filed 15 month ago , still hasn ’ t been heard . It remains difficult for collusion to be proven , but if Kaepernick win , he could be awarded ten of million of dollar , and evidence uncovered in discovery and deposition could become public .
 Attendance in 2018 fell to it lowest level since 2011 . This drop will be rectified in part in 2020 when the Los Angeles Chargers move from a 27,000-capacity soccer stadium to a 70,000-capacity football stadium , but Washington , Tampa Bay and Cincinnati all suffered big drop .
 The N.F.L . operates on two plane : the day-to-day of small crisis and opportunity , and the issue that could take a bite out of the $ 15 billion-a-year league . Most thing fall into the first bucket , with no chance of harming a league whose revenue inch upward each season because of television contract signed earlier in this decade .
 Over the next decade , the N.F.L. ’ s ability to handle the changing medium and technology environment and the mounting health and safety challenge is likely to determine whether it reach it goal of $ 25 billion a year in revenue by 2027 and remains at the pinnacle of American sport .
 Arthur Blank , the owner of the Atlanta Falcons , is confident the league will continue to prosper . He belief the N.F.L . will receive even more money when contract to telecast Sunday and Monday game expire after the 2021 and 2022 season because of “ the number of way the product is distributed these day , ” he said .
 But the root of Blank ’ s confidence is the league ’ s longstanding strategy . “ The core of it is still going to be over-the-air free television , ” he said . “ That ’ s not going to change . ”

 Dan McCready wa a starry-eyed novice . Then his House race in North Carolina wa stolen .
 By Frank Bruni
 Opinion Columnist
 CHARLOTTE , N.C. — Election meddling needn ’ t be a foreign power planting fiction on Facebook and courting the ragtag disciple of a real estate magnate .
 It can be local . It can be low-tech : going door to door to round up and forge absentee ballot in a candidate ’ s favor . That ’ s what apparently happened last fall in North Carolina ’ s Ninth Congressional District , in one of the most egregious instance of federal election fraud in anyone ’ s memory .
 Results initially showed that the Republican , an evangelical minister named Mark Harris , beat the Democrat , a Marine veteran named Dan McCready , by just 905 vote . But then question about Harris ’ s operation emerged , and state official saw enough evidence of illegality to take the step last month of ordering a whole new election for later this year .
 It ’ s an extraordinary sequence of event , all the more so because McCready wa a first-time candidate driven by a degree of patriotism and idealism I don ’ t encounter in politician all that often . He ’ s 35 but could pas for 10 year younger , with a face that ’ s almost a caricature of Howdy Doody wholesomeness . He and his wife , Laura , a lawyer , have four kid , the oldest of whom is 8 , and two Labradoodles .
 I spent some time with him in North Carolina last May , before this unholy mess , and kept in touch through occasional phone call a the election drew closer and professional handicapper gave him even odds or better to wrest a House seat that Republicans had held for 55 year . He wa pumped .
 He wa le so when I reconnected with him here in Charlotte about a week ago and , over several hour of conversation , took stock of that patriotism and idealism , noting that his campaign mantra — country over party — exhorted Americans to rise above precisely the kind of vicious partisanship that infected his race .
 “ There ’ s this big tension that I feel , ” he told me . “ I will always be someone who genuinely want to work with both side . ”
 But when one side behaves despicably , he asked , how do you not call it and them out a passionately a you can ? How do you keep the faith ? “ The way these two thing come together — it ’ s muddy , ” he said .

 He had known , he said , that Republican official in North Carolina “ cheat to draw the district lines. ” In fact their gerrymandering wa deemed unconstitutional by a panel of federal judge last year and is now being examined by the Supreme Court . But he ha learned that on top of that , “ They cheat to steal vote . And now they ’ re sending email attacking Democrats , saying Democrats forced a new election . It ’ s like zero moral compass — literally zero . I didn ’ t expect that . ”
 President Trump wa asked late last month about what went down in the Ninth District , which ha led to the indictment of an operative who worked for Harris , Leslie Dowless , on felony charge of obstruction of justice and unlawful possession of absentee ballot . He responded that all fraud wa bad and pivoted into his self-pitying , delusional lament about an epidemic of illegal voting by undocumented immigrant . “ This didn ’ t fit the narrative , ” McCready said .
 What an optimism-straining odyssey he ha been on . He belonged to the bevy of military veteran who ran for office for the first time in 2018 , and he stood out even among them for his avoidance of divisive issue , his insistence on the possibility of post-partisan consensus , his buoyancy . He ’ d been a Boy Scout in his teen . A chess champion , too . His dad , a history buff , made him memorize the Gettysburg Address in the seventh grade .
 At Duke University , he majored in economics and thought about a career in consulting or finance . But 9-11 had happened when he wa a freshman , America wa fighting war in both Iraq and Afghanistan and he wa struck by how few of his classmate went into the military . He felt an obligation to serve and “ figured if I wa going to do it , go all the way. ” So he joined the Marines .
 He gave them four year , including seven month in Iraq , where he at one point had a religious awakening , “ became overwhelmed with joy and really felt God ’ s presence , ” and wa baptized by the chaplain for his battalion with water from the Euphrates River .
 Later he went to Harvard Business School , and later still he and a friend started a firm that rounded up investment for solar farm . “ I wa building a thriving business that helped make our state No . 2 in solar power , ” he said .
 But after seeing how ugly the 2016 presidential campaign wa , how nastily divided the country had become and how many politician seemed to be ethically unmoored , he decided on a congressional bid . Democratic leader quickly recognized him a the kind of candidate who could compete in a purplish state and help them win the House majority .
 He loved campaigning — I could hear it in his voice . He loved the excuse it gave him to mingle with a range of people he might never otherwise meet and to make the le fortunate among them feel seen and heard . He loved the rigor of the trail , the way it tapped into and tested his reserve of energy . He loved the learning curve . He loved the way he got better and better at his stump speech , until it wa fluid and reflexive .
 On Election Day he wa confident that he ’ d win , though he sensed it would be a squeaker . It wa , so much so that he didn ’ t concede to Harris until 24 hour after the poll closed . He wa crestfallen , and Laura , who ’ d been wowed by how tirelessly he ’ d worked , took it even harder . “ I wa surprised by how bad I felt — physically — about it , ” she told me . “ I felt like I wa punched in the gut. ” They took the kid to Disney World , for the kind of family time they ’ d missed out on during the race .
 But that wa hardly that . Over the next week , there were louder and louder rumbling about something amiss in two of the district ’ s eight county , where the count of absentee ballot didn ’ t make sense . One of those county , Bladen , wa the only one where the majority of those ballot went to Harris . In late November , the state board of election announced that it would not yet certify the result , pending further investigation . McCready wa shocked .
 And he remained so a he learned more about what investigator were looking into and how long it had been ignored .
 Dowless had been suspected in year past of tampering with absentee ballot . The United States attorney in the area had been alerted , but had spent his energy instead looking for the supposedly widespread voting by undocumented immigrant that Trump kept ranting about — and that ha never been proven .
 The executive director of the state Republican Party had been warned about Dowless ’ s alleged scheme but nonetheless let Harris hire him . What ’ s more , Harris had done so in a manner apparently meant to avoid detection , having a third party pay him .
 As this and more came to light , Republicans in North Carolina and in Washington were either silent or accusatory , saying that Democrats were sore loser trying to overturn an election they ’ d narrowly “ lost ” — though that loss wa very much in question . Meantime , many Democrats shrugged , figuring that dirty trick were part and parcel of local politics , they were hard to prove , and the board of election would never go so far a to throw out the vote count , which is pretty much unheard-of .
 “ There wa this air of fatalism , ” Aaron Simpson , the director of communication for the McCready campaign , recalled . Laura McCready described the mood a : “ There ’ s fraud in Bladen County , and the sky is blue . ”
 Dan McCready said that he wa also tempted to shrug , given his exhaustion and the unlikelihood of any remedy . But he wa too incensed . “ This is our most sacred right in America — to vote , ” he said . “ It ’ s a right that people have fought and died for. ” To have it corrupted like this wa wrong .
 So he and his aide joined other concerned North Carolinians in rounding up affidavit , pressuring investigator , guiding reporter . That effort came to a climax with hearing last month during which Harris ’ s sworn testimony — that he knew nothing of Dowless ’ s shady reputation — wa contradicted under oath by his own son , who also made clear that his father had hidden email from investigator . Disgraced and reeling , Harris claimed memory problem , reversed course and himself insisted on a new election .
 He ’ s not running , but nearly a dozen other Republicans are , and whoever win their primary will face off against McCready in September or November . Meantime the district hasn ’ t been represented in the House since January . It ’ s not at all clear that McCready will win , but it is clear that local Republicans , far from being abashed , will brand him a troublemaker .
 If McCready doe prevail , it will be a a changed man . “ Why did it take a big congressional race and a candidate and a team to get so angry for this whole thing to come out ? ” he asked . “ This is why voter think all politician are a bunch of crook . I bet if you polled and you asked , ‘ Are politician a bunch of crook in it for themselves , bought , sold ? , ’ you ’ d get a vast majority of people who believe that — about Democrats and Republicans . ”
 I can ’ t imagine the McCready I met nearly a year ago sounding that bitter . Back then , he conceded , “ I didn ’ t realize how bad it wa . ”
 So why doe he still want this House seat , and from where doe he draw hope that he can make a difference ? Well , from the fact he did make a difference : There ’ s no telling if , without his persistence , Dowless would have been indicted and the election nullified . In the end , the system did work . And if McCready doe get to Washington , he can lend all that energy of his to the cause of election integrity and voting right , which many Democrats are rightly prioritizing .
 “ This probably sound , like , totally cheesy , ” he said , “ but I just love this country , and we ’ re not going to fix what ’ s wrong with it until we get better people there . ”
 Amen to that . And good luck to him .

 Colleen and Lauren Mullen , who rose through the coaching rank and married , have a girl and twin boy . For now , Colleen is on the sideline and Lauren is cheering and child-watching .
 By Kevin Armstrong
 ALBANY — Lauren Mullen pulled her black hat low over her eye , paid $ 10 for a ticket and entered Sefcu Arena just before tip-off recently . She sat in Section 150 . There were 18 row between her and any other fan . She trained her focus on the two head coach .
 On the visiting bench sat the University of Massachusetts , Lowell coach , Tom Garrick , a former N.B.A . player . Last spring , Mullen , then the woman ’ s basketball coach at New York University , interviewed for the position that Garrick now hold . It wa the third time in four year that she had been a finalist for a Division I head-coaching job . Her résumé included a 103-58 record and five postseason berth with the Violets .
 On the home sideline stood Mullen ’ s wife , Colleen , the coach of SUNY Albany . Colleen got the job one month after Lauren lost out to Garrick . An associate coach at West Point for six year , Colleen reached the N.C.A.A . Division I tournament twice . When Albany hired Colleen , Lauren resigned from N.Y.U . to stay at home with their child : Maggie , 3 , and their 1-year-old twin , Brennan and Callan .
 “ When you think about it , if I had gotten the Lowell job , I would ’ ve been over there , ” Lauren said , pointing to Garrick . And Colleen , she added , would have been with the child . “ Crazy , just crazy , ’ ’ she said .
 It is , though , the path they are taking a a same-sex coaching couple with three small child and all sort of demand and challenge .
 Indeed , Colleen joined a small sorority when Albany hired her . Although the Supreme Court approved same-sex marriage three year ago and college campus can be among the more progressive place in the United States , Colleen say she is one of only five woman she know of who are openly gay head coach in college basketball . She recalled how Sue Johnson , her coach at the University of New Hampshire at the time who is now the athletic director at Concord Academy in Massachusetts , came out 16 year ago , when Colleen wa a senior . At the time , Johnson ’ s longtime partner , Kelly , wa pregnant , and Johnson informed the team of their relationship after a practice .
 It wa the chaos familiar to a lot of dual-income household that led Lauren and Colleen to a crossroad last winter . After four year of matching basketball calendar to Colleen ’ s biological clock to plan birth for the off-season , timing recruiting call around nap schedule , and wrestling with nanny problem and a merry-go-round of fill-in babysitter , they needed a change .
 “ We were at a breaking point , ” Colleen said . “ A lot of coming and going . ”
 “ Absolute insanity , ” Lauren said . “ To be frank , at the end of last year , it wa like , ‘ O.K. , what are we going to do ? ’ ”
 Both 38 , the Mullens knew one of them needed to get a Division I head coaching job so the other could afford to step back into a supporting role .
 A pact wa made early on . They would not pursue the same job , though they had competed for employment once before .
 That occurred when they met , in 2007 . At the time , Lauren wa a graduate assistant at Lehigh . There wa an opening for an assistant coaching position , and Lauren applied for the internal promotion . Colleen , then an assistant at Southern New Hampshire University , also applied . They possessed similar credential . Colleen stood 5 foot 2 inch and had starred at the University of New Hampshire a a pass-first point guard . Lauren wa 5-foot-4 , and wa a facilitator at Hofstra . Colleen , who is six month older , got the job .
 Soon after , they played one-on-one for the first and only time . Lauren beat Colleen . Any lingering tension turned to mutual interest . On opening day of practice that season , they went on their first date .
 “ She didn ’ t hate me for that long , ” Colleen said . “ She got a master ’ s from Lehigh . She ’ s in good shape . ”
 Early in their relationship , they visited Colleen ’ s family . While there , they realized they had played in the same Florida tournament when they were 13 . Colleen found a photo that captured Lauren guarding her on an inbounds play .
 They kept their relationship quiet a they began to climb the coaching ladder , drawing interest from South Carolina to Connecticut . Once , while Colleen wa at Long Island University and Lauren wa at Sacred Heart in Connecticut , they were in the same conference . L.I.U . beat Sacred Heart both time they played .
 “ I slept on the couch , ” Colleen said . “ It ’ s fine . ”
 “ She ’ s lying , ” Lauren said . “ She would have made me sleep on the couch . Takes her a little time to let the steam off . ”
 Colleen went north to West Point to become an assistant coach in June 2011 . Weeks later , President Obama ended the United States military ’ s “ don ’ t ask , don ’ t tell ” policy , the 17-year-old law that banned openly gay men , lesbian and bisexual from military service . Colleen then found herself in competition with Lauren once more , this time for a recruit . Her name wa Kelsey Minato , from Huntington Beach , Calif .
 Minato wa a prolific outside scorer and Lauren wa the first to reach out to her . She and Colleen had sat side-by-side in the stand watching Minato at a tournament in Arizona , and Colleen encouraged Lauren to speak with Minato ’ s coach afterward . Lauren followed through .
 A few week later , Army realized it needed a guard , and Colleen asked Lauren whether she would mind if Army pursued Minato . Lauren welcomed the competition . Minato wa unaware of the relationship between the recruiter , and narrowed her choice to Sacred Heart and Army . She eventually became the best player in Army history , scoring 49 point in one game , breaking record and having her No . 5 jersey retired .
 “ I wa going to ride that wave for a long time , have a nice halo around my head for finding her , ” Colleen said .
 But it wa Lauren who became a head coach first . That summer , she signed on to lead N.Y.U . While Colleen sold recruit on West Point ’ s structure , Lauren pitched West Fourth Street ’ s freedom . One day , Lauren announced that practice wa canceled . In came the West Point woman in camouflage gear for a boot camp .
 “ My player were all like , ‘ Oh , no ! ’ ” Lauren said . “ They wanted no part . ’ ’
 In any case , win at both program followed , along with a wedding in May 2014 .
 “ New experience for me , ” said Dave Magarity , the head coach of the West Point woman ’ s team . “ There were a lot of cigar floating around . ”
 The Mullens were living in Ossining , N.Y. — 26 mile from West Point , 36 mile from Greenwich Village . And Colleen , known a The Mullenator at West Point , recalled that Magarity defended her sexual orientation . When a recruit ’ s parent asked which member of his staff were married , Magarity said , “ Don ’ t ever ask that question again . ”
 “ Dave wa like papa bear , ” Colleen said .
 Last May , Albany , which ha reached six of the last seven N.C.A.A . tournament , hired Colleen a it head coach . After starting 1-9 , the Great Danes have gone 10-5 and are tied for third place in the America East .
 As a head coach , Colleen , who ha been openly gay since college , now find herself calculating when to mention Lauren , who came out when she wa in her mid-20s .
 “ When I am talking to certain people , and I bring up my wife , there ’ s a second thought in my head , ” Colleen said . “ It ’ s like , ‘ Should I just talk about my kid ? ’ It doesn ’ t feel right when you censor yourself . ”
 Up in the stand , it ha not taken long for Lauren to find her voice a a spectator . When the season schedule wa announced , she cleared her calendar to be in attendance at Albany ’ s opener at the University of South Florida . She had not been able to make one of Colleen ’ s game in year . In the stand , Lauren described herself a “ out of control . ’ ’
 “ I knew it , but I couldn ’ t help myself , ’ ’ Lauren said . “ I wa like , I need to calm down , but then I ’ d say , ‘ That ’ s a walk ! They walked ! ’ ”
 She and Colleen bought a house in Bethlehem , N.Y. , last August . On a recent night there , Maggie played with Disney princess stamp a Lauren cut chicken nugget for the boy . A chalkboard featured a to-do list above a diagram of “ Double Horns , ” an offensive set .
 “ We ’ re like a sociology experiment because Maggie want gown and she ’ d maybe seen her mom in like 10 dress combined , ” Lauren said . The boy , she added , had all girl toy to choose from but are indicating an interest in truck .
 And Maggie is learning what come with winning . After a victory over the University of Maryland Baltimore County , the Great Danes awaited Colleen in the home locker room . Maggie wa hesitant to go inside , so Lauren let her know that she would be waiting in the hallway . After Maggie and Colleen entered , the door closed behind them . A roar could be heard a guard Kyara Frames lifted Colleen in the air , per their celebratory custom . Eleven second later , Maggie ran out cry .
 “ Mom ’ s having fun , ” Lauren told her . “ The girl are having fun . ”

 Naturalistic pet performer , in movie like “ Can You Ever Forgive Me ? ” and “ Widows , ” are making Toto look like a hack .
 By Amanda Hess
 The movie had a dead cat problem .
 As the director Marielle Heller prepared to shoot “ Can You Ever Forgive Me ? , ” a biopic about the literary forger Lee Israel , she knew that she would need a highly realistic prop to pull off the pivotal scene where Israel find her beloved pet cat , Jersey , dead . Heller wanted a dead cat with heft . She wanted an inanimate object that her star , Melissa McCarthy , could act against . “ I wa really intense about it , ” Heller said over the phone recently . “ We discussed strategy a number of time . ”
 So important wa the dead cat that Heller sought to secure it even before casting the film ’ s real live Jersey . She ’ d just find a feline that looked like her wonderful prop . How much difference could the real one make , anyway ? On her first film , “ The Diary of a Teenage Girl , ” she had saved money by tossing her own cat , Willie , in front of the camera . So when the movie ’ s animal trainer promised to bring in what she called her highest-performing cat , Heller wasn ’ t sure what that could mean . That it wasn ’ t going to pee everywhere ?
 The cat ’ s name wa Towne . He wa a lanky black and white guy with green eye and a petal pink nose , and to everyone ’ s surprise , he wa amazing . Yes , he followed direction — hitting his mark with the help of a trainer equipped with a clicker and a laser pointer — but he also seemed to do something more . “ Towne had a very expressive face , ” Heller said .
 There is a moment in the film where he gaze toward McCarthy “ sort of sympathetically , and also judgmentally , and you feel all of that , ” she added . Heller ended up commissioning a prop modeled after Towne that cost thousand of dollar — the most expensive one for the production .
 Towne ’ s effort did not go unnoticed . “ This cat is out-acting me , ” McCarthy thought a they worked . “ The Marlon Brando of cat , ” Deadline raved upon the film ’ s release . Declared Jezebel : “ This Cat Deserves an Oscar ! ”
 Towne ’ s turn in “ Can You Ever Forgive Me ? ” is emblematic of a new class of animal performance , one that are recognized a much for what the animal doe not do a for what it doe . These animal are not filmed talking like human or fetching thing . They don ’ t shake hand or roll over . Instead they are captured somewhat naturalistically . Towne spends much of “ Can You Ever Forgive Me ? ” gazing languidly from the couch . At the emotional core of “ Roma ” sits a family dog , it incessant barking , and it accumulating waste ; Borras is a professional dog behaving a if woefully untrained . And in “ Widows , ” a fluffy white terrier named Olivia pant calmly , the image of unsuspecting innocence , a violent criminal creep around her . Olivia is “ paving new ground for the canine acting community , ” Alyssa Bereznak wrote at The Ringer , and she ha ambled into her own grass root Oscar campaign .
 By these modern standard , Toto is an amateur . Mister Ed ? A hack . A year of buzzy pet performance raise the question : Are animal getting better at acting ?
 Before we get to that , some sad news : After a decade-long career , Towne himself died last year . In a phone interview , his trainer described him a a really nice cat who loved people . He is survived by his look-alike brother , with whom he often acted .
 Towne wa never really acting , at least , not in the human sense . If animal have any “ motivation ” for their performance , it lie largely in delicious treat . Towne loved jar of baby food , while Olivia dined on hot dog on the “ Widows ” set . Our sense of a “ good ” animal actor is a combination of it behavioral training and our own emotional projection .
 But are they getting better ?
 They are , kind of .
 Animals were among the first silent film star , and they ’ ve been hailed a natural performer ever since . “ A certain critical tradition ha taken animal a the standard by which to judge all acting , animal or human , ” said James Leo Cahill , a professor of cinema study at the University of Toronto . The appeal lie in their “ lack of self-consciousness before the camera . ”
 But while animal have often been coded a natural , they have not always been filmed that way . It wa once common to use physical restraint , shock collar and trip wire to produce unnatural animal behavior on film . Consider the “ Dogville ” comic short that played before feature in the 1930s , in which dog appeared to play instrument , walk on two leg , and kiss each other , effect that could be achieved by attaching piano wire to the dog ’ limb and manipulating their body like puppet .
 Those practice drew protest from animal right group , and by the 1940s , animal welfare regulation had arrived in Hollywood . “ One of the biggest shift in how animal are filmed ” arose from “ cultural re-evaluations of what constitutes cruelty toward animal , ” said Courtney E. White , an instructor at Columbia College Hollywood who study the intersection of cinema and animal welfare . As Jonathan Burt noted in his 2002 book “ Animals in Film , ” the focus of filmmaking flipped from serving what the director wanted to what the animal needed .
 The shift helped fuel a swiftly professionalizing animal training industry . A highly skilled and thoroughly prepared animal became much more important to a production ’ s success . Burt writes that while it wa once typical for trainer to show up on set cold , they now received exacting instruction in advance . At the same time , training method were growing more sophisticated : applying B.F. Skinner ’ s operant conditioning theory allowed trainer to reward more precise behavior in animal and delay their gratification , too — helping animal to “ act ” in a scene without always looking to a trainer for instruction or treat .
 As the treatment of animal changed , so did viewer expectation . Film became a powerful tool for animal right activist , a trend that ’ s culminated in PETA ’ s sophisticated viral video operation . Modern audience are now hypersensitive to image of animal harm . Just a whiff of force can make them uneasy , even when the animal on set is perfectly safe . Part of what wa so unusual about Olivia in “ Widows ” wa her apparent Zen calm even while in the clutch of a villain .
 These changing norm can appear almost like a stylistic shift . Cahill call the effect “ not unlike pre- and post-Method acting , which dramatically changed the criterion upon which naturalistic acting wa both approached and judged. ” Today ’ s animal are , paradoxically , both better trained and styled a more “ natural ” than their predecessor .
 It ’ s probably not a coincidence that “ natural ” animal actor are earning rapturous praise just a we enter a new era of unreal image , thanks to the rise of C.G.I . Olivia ’ s trainer , Greg Tresan of Animal Casting Atlanta , said that his animal are now routinely submitted for full body scan before filming . Disney ’ s forthcoming “ live-action ” adaptation of “ The Lion King ” will star a savanna of computer-generated animal . A performer like Towne — who , Heller assured me , wa unassisted by C.G.I . — is now an outlier .
 C.G.I . can achieve feat that real animal can not , but like the piano wire before it , it can also disturb in it unreality . “ A lot of film theory would argue that no matter how good the fake animal get , it won ’ t produce the same emotional resonance in viewer a a real animal , ” White said . Perhaps Hollywood ’ s wave of elaborate fake creature ha inspired a bit of a backlash , too , and a renewed desire for animal image that feel studiously real .
 After all , on YouTube , hyper-realistic animal performance abound , filmed by amateur who have all the time in the world to capture interesting behavior from their pet . We ’ ve never been more aware of what cat and dog look like in the natural wild of our living room . The social internet is fueled by such image . Hollywood is panting to catch up .

 An appreciation of the classic that define the city and set the bar for comforting food , skilled service and community .
 By Tejal Rao
 LOS ANGELES — It wa Friday night in Cypress Park , and King Taco glowed with neon . Inside , teenager in sweatshirt and shiny puffer coat tipped cup of salsa on beef-tongue taco . Cooks hustled , calling out order in Spanish .
 Angelenos don ’ t usually know where I live if I rattle off the cross street , but add just one detail — that the first location of King Taco is close by — and many of them can drop a pin on a map . A few have reminded me that Raul Martinez Sr. , who started the California chain in 1974 , drove one of the city ’ s first food truck , altering the course of culinary history in Los Angeles with little more than an old ice cream van and a stack of tortilla .
 The first King Taco is a cramped , vaguely peach-colored building at the end of a residential street . The window are covered up with poster of chimichangas and champurrado . The grout is stained . It ’ s nothing fancy . But like many old restaurant in Los Angeles , it ’ s a landmark in the city ’ s consciousness .
 As a new critic in town , I knew I had to start by paying respect to elder like this one — the steakhouse and the taco stand , the diner and the burger joint that have endured and collectively defined the city , a new contender have come and gone .
 The restaurant business is punishing , and Los Angeles is often misunderstood by outsider a a city without history . These place defy the stereotype , and draw diner of all age and background .
 I appealed to Angelenos for their favorite then set out to learn more . Slowly , I worked my way through a map of 30 or so restaurant , connected by a squiggly , grease-smeared line that traced a history , stretching back in some case more than a century .
 On the edge of Chinatown , I kicked around sawdust inside Philippe the Original while waiting for a couple of French-dips — the sandwich stuffed with thinly carved beef and lamb , the soft roll drenched with salty brown pan-roasting juice .
 Philippe ’ s wa founded in 1908 and moved to it current location in the 1950s . The menu reflects the grizzled taste of another era : I pulled the meat and elastic tendon from pickled pig ’ s foot , and marveled at hard-boiled pickled egg , still tender , dyed purple with beet juice , smeared with nose-tingling hot mustard .
 Just down the street , in the heart of old Los Angeles , I ate at Cielito Lindo , a small stand open since 1934 and largely responsible for the popularity of taquitos in the city . The tiny roll full of shredded beef are fried in wide pan , then soaked in a thin avocado sauce while still hot . They were properly drenched , but remained delicately crunchy .
 Locals and tourist stood in the sunshine , picking the taquitos up with their finger , talking between bite .
 Dan Tana ’ s , the low-key celebrity hangout in West Hollywood , took my reservation over the phone . I sat in a slippery booth with a burly , well-built veal parm , saturated in red sauce , almost hidden beneath a shining layer of molten cheese , watching the well-dressed server dress bowl after bowl of Caesar salad on a trolley in the middle of the room . ( And I did my best to ignore Alfred Molina and Eric McCormack at the next table — even a they broke into song . )
 When the weather turned cold and rainy , and the city got dark at 5 p.m. , I fortified myself with spicy clam broth at Beverly Soon Tofu , a small restaurant with shiny redwood table in a strip mall in Koreatown . Monica Lee , an immigrant from Seoul , opened her place in 1986 . Originally on Beverly Boulevard , it wa the first in the neighborhood to specialize in a menu of soondubu , or tofu stew .
 She bought soy milk to make the tofu in-house , and gave diner several option to customize their bowl — to choose not only the general direction of their stew but also the level of it heat .
 Ms. Lee , 65 , buy the fresh , soft , wobbly tofu now , but still get up early a few time a week to shop for produce . ( She tried vegetable delivery , briefly , in 1987 , but missed picking out the cabbage and spring onion herself . ) The tofu is ghostly pale and delicate , but the stew come out hot , bubbling vigorously and viciously , stained red with a chile paste that Ms. Lee make herself .
 While new restaurant in Los Angeles struggle to train and retain staff , the cook at Beverly Soon Tofu have worked with Ms. Lee for decade , fermenting kimchi and frying kelp . “ They speak broken Korean to me , I speak broken Spanish to them , ” Ms. Lee said . “ And this is how we work together . ”
 At the Tam O ’ Shanter , a Scottish-themed pub in Atwater Village , I lined up in front of Stevie Delgado for six ounce of prime rib with mashed potato and creamed spinach — a generously portioned plate lunch . The restaurant ha been open since 1922 , and Mr. Delgado ha worked at it carving station , by the bar in the dining room , for the last 30 year . He filled my plate in an instant , ladling it with gravy .
 Mr. Delgado slice five ounce of blush prime rib for sandwich , and either six or 10 ounce for a plate . The scale , which doesn ’ t move from Mr. Delgado ’ s side , isn ’ t for him — I think he could cut precisely 10 ounce with his eye closed . It ’ s for the occasional suspicious diner who doesn ’ t think Mr. Delgado is getting it right .
 The Tam O ’ Shanter server wear tartan skirt and wool hat , which can give the place the look of a fusty tourist attraction . But to dismiss it a such is to misunderstand the vital role it play for regular .
 Though the Tam O ’ Shanter wa a clubby hangout for Disney executive in the 1950s , the lunchtime crowd that now fill the kitschy pub is a more diverse representation of the city : elderly couple with their elbow locked together , immigrant family and group of young woman , clinking their pint of beer . They ’ re drawn in not just by the restaurant ’ s unfussy comfort food , but by it consistency and warmth .
 I enjoyed the steakhouse chain Lawry ’ s the Prime Rib , run by the same company a the Tam O ’ Shanter , even more after I learned that the Los Angeles chef Roy Choi ha been going to the location on La Cienega Boulevard since he wa about 5 .
 Mr. Choi ’ s father worked there in the 1960s , a a dishwasher and busboy , and the restaurant later became a place to celebrate important family occasion , like birthday and graduation .
 “ It ’ s been a part of my life before I wa born , ” Mr. Choi said . “ I think the moment my father could afford it , and I could chew , he took us. ” Mr. Choi , a founder of Kogi BBQ who also wrote the cookbook “ L.A . Son , ” compared Lawry ’ s old-fashioned banquet-hall environment to “ an American dim sum parlor . ”
 It ’ s never just about the food . Culinary institution often have the kind of professional , experienced employee that new restaurant can only dream about : Bartenders who can read the slightest change in body language . Unflappable server .
 At the U-shaped counter inside the Apple Pan , a sparse diner in West Los Angeles , the smoky burger in squishy bun are wrapped in paper and unceremoniously plopped onto the counter by a highly efficient staff with total command over the lunch rush .
 And when the server in a pressed red jacket at the Musso & Frank Grill learned that my dining companion wa pregnant , he wa attentive but not patronizing . Witty , but not inappropriate . This shouldn ’ t be so remarkable , but it is .
 Musso ’ s , in Hollywood , maintains an impossibly charming dining room with faded wallpaper and warmly lit burgundy booth . Under the influence of a bracingly cold martini , I wondered if it cold jellied beef consommé , eaten with a spoon — the kind of thing you ’ d feed a sickly Victorian schoolchild — stood a chance at a comeback . Maybe not , but the cocktail and steak are unfailing . The wedge salad are dignified .
 For hot pastrami , I headed to Langer ’ s , in Westlake , and to Canter ’ s , a 24-hour deli that opened in a former theater in Fairfax in 1953 .
 On return visit to Canter ’ s for sandwich and matzo-ball soup — and simply to be in it bustling dining room , among it regular — I found it particularly fulfilling to check in on the pastry case , crammed with sweet . I noticed how the word “ banana , ” written in bright yellow frosting on the chocolate-iced loaf cake , changed drastically depending on who had decorated it .
 The longer my tour of classic went on , the le dutiful it felt . There wa nothing campy or insincere about the pleasure of old Los Angeles . Not even it fast food .
 Mr. Martinez , who founded King Taco , went on to build a small empire of Mexican restaurant in Southern California , and the taco al pastor that he first peddled from a truck — a style of taco he helped popularize in Los Angeles before it became a staple — is still a reliably good snack in what ha become a neighborhood hub .
 The tortilla are hot and flexible , the meat crisp at the edge , pleasingly greasy and deeply seasoned . The salsa are one-note , but sing with power .
 Though the table were all full , a few people scooted down , pushing their bag and coat to the side , making room , gesturing for me to sit . To join them . To eat by their side . They might a well have said it out loud : Welcome to Los Angeles .

 Vows
 By Leah Beckmann
 On the very last day of March — a month that would prove very important to Mitchell Messinger and Deb Kaplan Jacoby — the couple danced their first dance a newlywed .
 The song they chose wa “ I Lava You , ” from Disney ’ s 2014 animated film “ Lava , ” a short played before theater screening of “ Inside Out. ” The song tell the story of a patient kind of fairy tale , about a lonely volcano who sits isolated in the middle of the Pacific for thousand of year . Despite his desolation , he remains hopeful that one day he will find his love . What he can ’ t know is that another lonely volcano ha been living just below him under the sea , listening to his song all these year .
 Days after she and Mr. Messinger shared their first date , Ms. Kaplan Jacoby took her son , Josh , to see “ Inside Out. ” And there in the theater , tear streaming down her face at the sight of two volcano defying odds and geology to be together , Ms. Kaplan Jacoby recognized a version of her own love story .
 But first , there wa heartache .
 Mr. Messinger , 48 , a publicity director of ABC Entertainment , wa born in Manhattan to Barry and Lynda Messinger . Mrs. Messinger disliked the city , and they quickly moved to New Jersey when Mr. Messinger wa just 6 . He attended Syracuse University , where he wa for two year the school ’ s mascot , Otto the Orange . Soon after college , he married Michelle Levine .
 Mr. Messinger and Ms. Levine had been married for almost 17 year when , in May of 2014 , she died , at 42 , of breast cancer . Their daughter , Jillian , wa just 10 at the time . Suddenly a single father and grieving widower , Mr. Messinger found himself in the midst of the kind of tragedy people whisper about while knocking wood or tossing salt , in the hope that this kind of loss will somehow swerve around them .
 Slowly however , Mr. Messinger began to heal . After about a year , he decided it wa time to give dating a try . But now with apps and social medium to navigate , Mr. Messinger found the dating world completely transformed from the one he had first known . “ I felt like , O.K. , I ’ m not a millennial . I have a child. ” Mr. Messinger said . “ I just knew I wanted something more organic . I asked some close friend to start scanning their Rolodexes , which I don ’ t even think people use anymore. ” Before he knew it , every friend , cousin , and mom at the elementary school his daughter attended wa scanning their real or virtual Rolodexes .
 Meanwhile .
 Ms. Kaplan Jacoby , 46 , wa born to Dr. Howard and Georgie Kaplan . She grew up in Salt Lake City , and later attended Emerson College in Boston . She is currently a senior client success manager at CareerArc .
 By 2015 , Ms. Kaplan Jacoby had also decided to give dating a second shot . She had left her marriage in 2010 , and wa officially divorced from her husband in 2012 . Her daughter , Sarah , wa 8 , and her son Josh , almost 5 . The separation had been difficult , and Ms. Kaplan Jacoby waited year before she wa ready to date again . But when she wa ready , she wa ready . “ I went on a lot of date , ” she said laughing , but nothing sparked . “ I wa ready to swear off dating all together . And then Sharon called to ask if I would be interested in a blind date with a widower . ”
 Sharon Rosenthal and Ms. Kaplan Jacoby met in the 1990s a co-worker who quickly became close friend . Ms. Rosenthal knew Ms. Kaplan Jacoby well , but she wa hesitant to get involved in any kind of setup . “ It made me nervous , ” she said . “ You don ’ t want to accept the responsibility if it doesn ’ t work out . I wa just cautious. ” But when Ira Sherak , a close friend of Mr. Messinger , told Ms. Rosenthal that he had an idea about two friend whom he thought might really hit it off , she paid attention . Mr. Sherak , after all , had introduced Ms. Rosenthal to her own husband . In fact , Mr. Sherak ha quite the track record a a professional yenta . They couldn ’ t know it yet , but this would be his fourth setup to result in marriage .
 Mr. Sherak had been close friend with the Messingers for year . He ’ d known Mr. Messinger ’ s first wife well , and he wanted to see his friend happy again . “ The story I ’ d heard about Deb through Sharon reminded me so much of Michelle , ” Mr. Sherak said . “ They were both sharp and funny . And they shared the same core value . All of these little thing just added up. ” Apparently that age-old adage applies to couple and matchmaker alike : When you know , you know .
 Ms. Kaplan Jacoby and Mr. Messinger had their first date March 25 , 2015 . This is a date Ms. Kaplan Jacoby can confirm with certainty because she diligently kept a journal entry of each one of the date she and Mr. Messinger shared . Their first date wa sushi . Later , they hiked , saw movie , and took small weekend trip away . Both avid Broadway fan ( their honeymoon is a Broadway-themed cruise to Alaska , hosted by Sirius XM ’ s Seth Rudetsky ) , they attended show at the Pantages theater in Los Angeles .
 One afternoon , Mr. Messinger took Ms. Kaplan Jacoby to a French restaurant . As she gamely admired the Parisian décor , she asked him if he knew how to say anything in French . “ J ’ adore Deb , ” he told her . She asked him what it meant , smiled , but said nothing in return . It wasn ’ t until several hour later that it dawned on her : he ’ d just told her he loved her for the first time . Finally , 77 entry later , Ms. Kaplan Jacoby decided it wa time to stop journaling . She had found her future .
 It wa also around this time that she and Mr. Messinger decided they were ready to introduce their child to each other . Jillian , Sarah and Josh are close in age . Jillian and Sarah , now 15 and 14 , even share a birthday . But so much of the close friendship they would eventually develop can be attributed to their grandparent . Mr. Messinger remains close with his first in-law , Stu and Helene Levine , a doe Ms. Kaplan Jacoby with hers , Marc and Marci Jacoby . All four set of grandparent attended the wedding . Ms. Kaplan Jacoby ’ s father-in-law even joined them for dinner the night the child met , facilitating new friendship and putting everyone at ease . If it wa possible for these complicated relationship to blend together so effortlessly , perhaps they , the child , could a well .
 On March 3 2018 , Mr. Messinger asked Ms. Kaplan Jacoby to marry him . It wa , by every definition of modern romance , a perfect proposal : at the Four Seasons Hotel Westlake Village , in a Japanese-style pagoda that wa reminiscent of their first date . After she said yes , they went to the bar to celebrate and were shocked to find Chris Harrison , the longtime host of ABC ’ s reality show “ The Bachelor , ” there to congratulate them . Mr. Harrison is a longtime friend of Mr. Messinger , and he just happened to be there that night . But for the million of Americans who watch “ The Bachelor , ” having the crowned head of professional engagement present seemed like some kind of cosmic Hollywood blessing .
 By November 2018 , the two family had been living together in Mr. Messinger ’ s house in Bell Canyon , Calif. , for several month when disaster would strike . The Woolsey Fire , which ravaged Los Angeles and Ventura county , tore through their neighborhood . Of the 10 house on their street , only three would remain standing . Fortunately , the Messinger-Kaplan Jacoby home wa spared . Still , the house wa badly damaged , and the family evacuated . ( They still have not been given the all clear to return to their home . )
 For the first two week after the fire , they stayed together at Ms. Kaplan Jacoby ’ s father-in-law ’ s home . They then spent the next two month in a hotel , Josh bunking with Mr. Messinger and Ms. Kaplan Jacoby , while Sarah and Jillian shared their own room . What had initially been a shy and careful friendship between the girl , quickly became something much deeper . “ It wa a blessing in disguise because we all became really close , ” Sarah said . The experience transformed the trio into sibling .
 On Sunday , March 31 , almost exactly a year to the day after their engagement , and four year after their first date , Ms. Kaplan Jacoby and Mr. Messinger wed before 80 friend and family member in a morning ceremony at the Four Seasons Hotel Los Angeles at Beverly Hills . It wa one of those beautiful Los Angeles morning that no one , not even the jaded Californians accustomed to this kind of weather , can resist commenting on . Mr. Messinger and a handful of family member and close friend gathered in a small room where he and Ms. Kaplan Jacoby would sign the ketubah , the Jewish marriage license , before the ceremony . With an endearing case of wedding morning jitter , Mr. Messinger happily hopped around playing the host , introducing those who didn ’ t already know each other . In his element a this natural hype man , it wasn ’ t difficult to imagine Otto the Orange in action .
 The air wa soft and smelled of jasmine a Ms. Kaplan Jacoby , wearing a fitted lace gown by DB Studio , strode into the lush courtyard where Mr. Messinger wa waiting , with his back to her . Smiling , she playfully tapped him on the shoulder . Overwhelmed by the bittersweetness of the day , Mr. Messinger wa in tear before he turned around . “ All good ? ” she gently checked in with him . “ All good , ” he reassured her .
 The family , including child and grandparent , stood together under the huppah . Jillian , Sarah and Josh stood to the left of Mr. Messinger , while Barry and Lynda Messinger , and Howard and Georgie Kaplan , stood proudly to the right of Ms. Kaplan Jacoby . This , Rabbi Stewart Vogel explained , is symbolic of how these two have chosen to walk into their future together : with family at their side .
 “ The beauty and extended nature of this family , ” Rabbi Vogel said , “ is that they are committed to these extended relationship . It ’ s what make them a truly modern family . ”
 As Mr. Messinger and Ms. Kaplan Jacoby exchanged their own vow , all three child — young teenager , who only minute before were making goofy face to stave off some of the seriousness of the day — wept openly .
 “ How lucky am I to have a second chance at love ? ” Mr. Messinger asked his bride , friend and family . To which the rabbi quipped , “ There ’ s not a dry eye in the house , Mitch . ”
 After the ceremony , friend and family filed into a sunlit room for a sumptuous brunch . “ Just enjoy it , ” said 11-year-old Josh , his foot dangling from a high-backed chair . “ It ’ s a one-time opportunity . Nobody life forever . You have to make it count . ”
 And just like that , the egg Benedict had been consumed , the cake had been cut , and the couple had been toasted with champagne . Through tear , friend of the bride and groom repeated the same sentiment again and again : Despite everything , they have found love again .
 Maybe it wasn ’ t thousand of year in the making , but they had found each other . And it wa time for them to dance . As they swayed in each others arm , Ms. Kaplan Jacoby softly sang along to the lyric of the song they had chosen together .
 Oh they were so happy
 To finally meet above the sea
 All together now their lava grew and grew
 No longer are they all alone .
 She knew every word by heart .

 Good Wednesday . ( Want this by email ? Sign up here . )
 Federal prosecutor in Boston charged dozen of wealthy parent yesterday in a scandal focused on the use of fraud and bribery to help child get into elite school .
 Plenty of big financial figure were indicted : They include Bill McGlashan , the managing partner of TPG ’ s growth-investment arm ; Gordon Caplan , the co-chairman of the law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher ; and Douglas Hodge , a former C.E.O . of the investment firm Pimco . The actress Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman also face charge .
 Fallout is already coming . Mr. McGlashan wa put on indefinite administrative leave from TPG .
 How the scheme worked , according to prosecutor :
 • William Singer masterminded the scheme through his Edge College & Career Network .
 • “ There is a front door which mean you get in on your own , ” Mr. Singer told one parent in a conversation that wa wiretapped . “ The back door is through institutional advancement , which is 10 time a much money. ” He promised a cheaper “ side door . ”
 • Parents paid Mr. Singer a total of about $ 25 million over eight year to bribe school official into designating their child a recruited athlete .
 • Mr. Singer wa accused of bribing athletic coach to campaign for certain student who lacked athletic credential to be admitted .
 • Indicted parent were also said to have paid to fake their child ’ s standardized test , at a rate of $ 15,000 to $ 75,000 per exam .
 Britain is hurtling toward unknown political territory after Parliament again rejected Prime Minister Theresa May ’ s plan for leaving the E.U. , Stephen Castle of the NYT writes .
 “ Mrs . May had hoped that last-minute concession from the E.U . would swing the vote in her favor , but many lawmaker dismissed those change a ineffectual or cosmetic and voted against the deal , 391 to 242 , ” Mr. Castle writes .
 Lawmakers vote today on whether they wish to proceed with a no-deal Brexit . If they don ’ t , they will then vote on seeking an extension to the schedule for leaving .
 That course of action “ doe not solve the problem , ” Mrs. May said last night . “ The E.U . will want to know what use we mean to make of such an extension , and the House will have to answer . ”
 But the result throw Britain into chaos . There are just 16 day to go before Brexit is scheduled to happen by default , and with control effectively wrestled from Mrs. May the nation is seemingly rudderless . Mrs. May could seek approval for her deal one last time ; Parliament could try to arrange a second referendum ; or there could be a general election to break the deadlock .
 And the business community is unimpressed . “ It ’ s time for Parliament to stop this circus , ” said Carolyn Fairbairn , the director-general of Confederation of British Industry . “ This must be the last day of failed politics . Jobs and livelihood depend on it . ”
 More : The British government revealed plan to temporarily loosen tariff under a no-deal Brexit , while also seeking to protect some industry , including ceramic and farming .
 While most of the world ha grounded the jet , which have been involved in two fatal crash within five month , American regulator have decided to keep them flying .
 European authority banned the plane from the air , joining regulator in China , Indonesia , Singapore , India and Australia , a well a numerous airline . Roughly two-thirds of the 737 Max 8 aircraft in the world are now grounded .
 President Trump spoke with Boeing yesterday , shortly after he had tweeted that airplane were becoming “ far too complex to fly. ” In a conversation with Dennis Muilenburg , the company ’ s C.E.O. , Mr. Trump wa reportedly reassured about the safety of the Max 8 jet .
 The F.A.A . stand firm on it decision not to ground the aircraft , saying that it found “ no basis ” to do so . Elaine Chao , the U.S. transportation secretary , said that she and the F.A.A . would “ take immediate and appropriate action ” if necessary . ( She also flew on a Max 8 yesterday . )
 But others disagree . Ray LaHood , a former secretary of transportation who grounded Boeing ’ s 787 Dreamliner in 2013 following fire in it lithium-ion battery , said that it wa the F.A.A. ’ s duty to ground the jet “ until there is 100 percent assurance ” of safety . Scott McCartney of the WSJ writes that the Department of Transportation , which is home to the F.A.A. , ha “ shown a pattern of lax regulation ” recently .
 The U.K. ha joined the growing army of voice calling for check on the power of Big Tech , with a government report that call for an overhaul of antitrust policy . It wa prepared by a panel led by Jason Furman , who wa a top economic adviser to President Barack Obama . More on the news from Adam Satariano of the NYT :
 • “ The 150-page report , ordered by the chancellor of the Exchequer , Philip Hammond , the country ’ s top Treasury official , said the country needed stricter rule on acquisition in the technology industry and stronger oversight to make sure that new rival can not be squashed . ”
 • “ Mr . Furman ’ s panel called for the creation of a ‘ digital market unit ’ that would require company to allow consumer to move data from one service to another . Large company would also have to make data available to competitor , a bid to lower barrier to entry by forcing them to share information . ”
 • “ The report also call for a code of conduct to be drafted for the biggest tech company that would be enforceable with fine . ”
 • As Grep Ip of the WSJ note , this is “ a carefully calibrated proposal designed to contain Big Tech ’ s threat to competition while keeping the government ’ s hand on the industry and the internet a light a possible . ”
 The White House ’ s chief trade negotiator , Robert Lighthizer , won ’ t say whether he belief that trade talk with China will yield the result that President Trump ha demanded .
 “ Our hope is we are in the final week of an agreement , ” Mr. Lighthizer told the Senate Finance Committee yesterday , report Alan Rappeport of the NYT .
 “ We ’ re either going to have a good result or we ’ re going to have a bad result before too long , but I ’ m not setting a specific time frame and it ’ s not up to me , ” he added . “ I ’ ll work a hard a I can , and the president will tell me when the time is up , or the Chinese will . ”
 The chance of success have risen and fallen in recent week . Negotiations have appeared to make progress on issue including currency manipulation and enforcement provision . But fear about Mr. Trump ’ s erratic bargaining style — compounded by his decision to walk out on talk with North Korea — have given Chinese official some jitter .
 Timothy Sloan went to Capitol Hill on Tuesday seeking to convince member of Congress that Wells Fargo had become a better bank — but by the time he left , few seemed to believe him , Emily Flitter of the NYT writes . Some highlight :
 • “ Representative Katie Porter , Democrat of California , questioned Mr. Sloan about exactly how meaningful the bank ’ s commitment to change wa , pointing out that it own lawyer had called such statement ‘ corporate puffery ’ in response to a lawsuit . ”
 • “ Representative Lance Gooden , a Republican from Texas , asked why Wells Fargo wa taking longer than expected to refund money to customer it had tricked into buying auto insurance . Mr. Sloan said the bank had engaged in ‘ a give-and-take ’ with the comptroller about how much to refund . ”
 • “ A spokesman for the bank ’ s primary regulator , the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency , released a statement on Tuesday saying official were ‘ disappointed ’ in the bank . ”
 Mr. Sloan wa the first of a parade of bank executive summoned to testify before the committee . Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase and David Solomon of Goldman Sachs will appear at a hearing on April 10 .
 Dr. Ned Sharpless , the director of the National Cancer Institute , wa named acting director of the F.D.A .
 Morgan Stanley promoted Lauren Cummings and Ashley MacNeill to lead it technology equity capital market practice in the Americas .

 When M. Night Shyamalan wa asked what the biggest plot twist in his own life wa , he paused and thought carefully .
 The answer , said Shyamalan , whose name ha been synonymous with twist since his 1999 breakthrough , “ The Sixth Sense , ” wa having come full circle : back to making film in his native Philadelphia , back to the kind of thriller that in 2002 led Newsweek to label him “ the Next Spielberg . ”
 “ All I want to do is make thriller , ” Shyamalan , 48 , said in a phone interview last week . After year spent making other kind of film , he added , coming back to what he loved most had prompted a realization : “ Wow , I had everything I wanted in the first place . ”
 It ’ s appropriate , then , that “ Glass , ” which debut this weekend , completes another kind of circle . Riding high on the success of it predecessor , “ Split ” ( 2017 ) , the film concludes an original superhero trilogy that began in 2000 with “ Unbreakable ” — a grim and deliberate origin story that arrived , perhaps , just a little too soon .
 Conventional wisdom then held that an original superhero story wouldn ’ t sell , and Shyamalan ha said that Disney , which produced “ Unbreakable , ” encouraged him not to market it a a comic-book movie — an unthinkable strategy today . ( A harbinger of the culture to come , “ X-Men , ” released that same year , grossed nearly 300 million . ) “ Unbreakable ” made money , but it fell way short of “ The Sixth Sense ” and failed to resonate the way Shyamalan had hoped .
 Still , his instinct were ultimately validated : Spandex went mainstream , and “ Unbreakable , ” always a critic ’ favorite , amassed a loyal fan base over the year , not least with the Comic Con set . Then Shyamalan surprised fan with “ Split ” : a horror-thriller sequel starring James McAvoy that took in over $ 278 million on a $ 9 million budget . After a string of critical failure including “ The Last Airbender , ” “ The Happening ” and “ After Earth , ” there wa talk of a comeback .
 That momentum also put pressure on “ Glass ” — which with it $ 20 million budget and long script , Shyamalan said , wa the toughest film he ever made . Calling from Europe , he talked about the film and offered insight on the “ Unbreakable ” universe , and on whether he would ever direct a “ Star Wars ” film . Following are edited excerpt from that conversation .
 When you made “ Unbreakable , ” the market for superhero movie wa nothing like it is today . What do you make of Hollywood ’ s being so welcoming of them now ?
 It make sense . I wa happy to be in front of that and say , “ Hey , let ’ s make a comic book movie , a movie about comic books. ” And everyone going : “ That ’ s a very fringe market . That ’ s not a mainstream notion , and regular people don ’ t go to see those kind of movies. ” And now , it ’ s ubiquitous .
 I understand it . It ’ s a mythology that ’ s self-empowering . It ’ s god among u . It ’ s story of regular people turning into god , essentially , in a modern vernacular .
 You were born in India , brought up Hindu , but attended Catholic school . What is your level of spirituality today , and ha it changed since “ The Sixth Sense ” ?
 It ’ s become more clarified in my mind . I think I would define myself a more of a believer in thing now in the sense that , post- “ Sixth Sense , ” I have always been a believer in something . I just couldn ’ t put a more accurate label on it .
 You ’ ve been agnostic .
 Yeah , I ’ m not religious at all . I have my issue with the specificity of organized religion and the tribalism that that conjures , but I am somebody who really belief in whatever you want to call it , the universe and our place in it .
 [ Check out The Times ’ s Culture Calendar here . ]
 When you ’ re around your family and friend , are you the comedian in the room ?
 Yeah , I ’ m the goofball in the room for sure . The place that I ’ m dead serious is when we talk about cinema . That ’ s the place I ’ m not a whole lot of fun to be around . If you ’ re going to watch a [ bad ] television show , you don ’ t want to watch that with me . You ’ re going to have a miserable time because I ’ ll be wincing and I ’ ll be commenting . For me , it ’ s an art form . Cinema need to be honored . Those ingredient need to be thought of in a sacred way .
 Some of the narrative surrounding “ The Visit ” and “ Split ” characterized them a “ comeback ” for you . Was that frustrating ?
 No , the journey isn ’ t really about what others are saying about you . It just can ’ t be . You ’ re taking all of your power away from you . That ’ s not where your energy should be . Your energy should be in the thing that you have control over . And a a writer , you have control over a ton .
 After “ Unbreakable ” came out , you talked about how it didn ’ t connect with audience the way you thought it would . Do you think it would connect better today ?
 I do think it would do really well today . It would ’ ve done even better when we first released it if we had really embraced that it wa a comic-book movie .
 “ Unbreakable ” and “ Split ” had drastically different tone . One wa a comic book movie and the other more a horror film . How did you merge the two for “ Glass ” ?
 Think of it this way : The tone of “ Unbreakable ” match it main character , David Dunn [ Bruce Willis ] , who ha a kind of somber , introspective , slow-build realization . And then the main character of “ Split ” is the kinetic , pyrotechnic character that ’ s violent , scary , funny and weird — and threatening . That film ha a very dark thriller , almost horror , vibe . And so it match it main character .
 And “ Glass ” represents it titular character , Mr. Glass [ Samuel L. Jackson ] . He is very philosophical and playing a chess match , and he ha a little tongue-in-cheek smile . So each movie hopefully represents it main character .
 Looking at James McAvoy ’ s character in “ Split ” and “ Glass , ” he kidnaps teenager and occasionally eats them . Especially in “ Split , ” some of the scene are quite gruesome . What kind of head space do you have to be in to create that ?
 I ’ ve been in more of a mood of doing more shocking thing and juxtaposing that against the emotion or the humor of a sequence . It ’ s funny because I feel that the tone I wa interested in , when I wa thinking about doing the trilogy , are more appropriate in the movie theater now than they were in 1999 .
 I ’ m a big supporter of my character . I really am devoted to them . They may do something horrific — but overall , I ’ m a supporter and very empathetic to where they ’ re coming from and why they have this behavior and where the trauma came from . As you ’ re watching “ Glass , ” you ’ re incredibly sympathetic to all of them , a you see the story come to it conclusion .
 After “ Split , ” there wa criticism of McAvoy ’ s character from mental health professional , saying that the portrayal stigmatized people with dissociative identity disorder . Was that fair ?
 That wa a very minor thing . In fact , this would be the biggest mention of it in it history . It wa like 1 percent of 1 percent of people even had that [ criticism ] . And there wa a huge positive reaction to it . Obviously , when you see “ Glass , ” you will see the incredibly positive portrayal of the character and the core character and the thing that they suffer from .
 When you were making “ Split , ” did you have an idea of how you wanted “ Glass ” to end ?
 I did . I had a couple idea about where the literal stitch line could be . So , I wa toying with those , but really between the time when I finished “ Split ” and when it came out , which wa about four month , it wa in that period that I wa writing “ Glass , ” and I wa really homing in on the exact specific .
 When “ Unbreakable ” came out , you said , “ I had more control this time , but not the fun. ” Did you have more fun making “ Glass ” ?
 No , I don ’ t have a ton of fun making my movie . I ’ m super stressed out the whole time .
 You have joked in the past about directing a “ Star Wars ” film , so let ’ s get serious . Would you like to direct a “ Star Wars ” film ?
 Oh , my goodness . I think it ’ s probably best if I , for the most part , just consider making original movie — trying primarily to maintain the cinematic accent that is most comfortable for me . There are filmmaker who don ’ t fit easily into a system , and probably I ’ m one of those . This sense of losing your accent is you lose who you are .
 So I think probably that ’ s the best way to think about it for right now . But you can never say no about the future .

 For the latest development , read our Thursday live briefing on the polar vortex here .
 CHICAGO — A merciless cold crippled the Midwest on Wednesday , halting plane and train , shuttering school and prompting official in Detroit , Minneapolis and Chicago to open emergency warming center for the homeless and vulnerable .
 The bitter weather wa believed to be tied to the death of at least eight people , including a man thought to have collapsed after shoveling snow and frozen to death in his Milwaukee garage . Hospitals saw a steady stream of patient reporting symptom of frostbite .
 Temperatures in Minneapolis dipped a low a minus 28 , with the wind chill reaching minus 53 , the National Weather Service said . Fargo , N.D. , reached minus 33 ; Milwaukee , minus 20 . The worst of the cold wa feared overnight into Thursday , when meteorologist predicted that temperature could dip to minus 27 in Chicago , a record for the city . The Midwest wa expected to see miserable temperature through Thursday , and the cold air wa moving east .
 Across the Midwest on Wednesday , resident who are used to carrying on with life ’ s routine despite bad weather had little choice but to shiver , stay indoors and make the best of it , even a the inside of their window became ominously lined with ice . Office worker were stuck at home . Parents scrambled for last-minute child care . In Michigan , a gas company asked customer to use le natural gas to heat their house after a fire at a compressor station .
 [ We asked people in Chicago who work in extreme cold for their practical tip for survival . Here ’ s what they said . ]
 Visits with prisoner in the Stearns County , Minn. , jail were canceled . In Fort Wayne , Ind. , garbage and recycling collection wa delayed . In Wisconsin , the unthinkable : Distributors grounded their truck , fearing that the beer would freeze solid .
 Even the United States Postal Service — despite it unofficial vow that courier can not be stopped by “ snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night ” — wa forced to suspend delivery in some particularly frigid place .
 Health official , urging people to go outside only if necessary , warned that exposing skin to the air could lead to frostbite . They were not exaggerating : Going gloveless for only a minute or two , in double-digit negative temperature , left hand feeling numb , then clumsy and flipper-like , then white-hot with pain .
 [ You could get frostbite in a matter of minute . Here ’ s what to do . ]
 In Chicago , what would normally be a bustling day slowed to a frigid crawl . Lake Shore Drive , rather than being choked with the usual morning traffic , wa leisurely . Buses continued on their route and “ L ” train rumbled through the city , but most car looked nearly empty . A few stray bicyclist in ski goggles and snow pant could still be seen pedaling painfully down the street , refusing to bow to the cold .
 Restaurants , museum and shop seemed to have one thing in common : a hastily placed sign on the door announcing that they were closed for the day .
 There would be no chance of a scoop of dulce de leche at Frio Gelato on Clark Street ( not that anyone would want it ) . Even “ Disney on Ice , ” which wa scheduled to run on Wednesday night at Chicago ’ s United Center , wa canceled .
 At Huck Finn , a diner on the Southwest Side , there were fewer patron than usual . But the customer who did come in were cheerful , almost exuberant .
 “ It ’ s like they ’ re living through some kind of weather history — everyone else stayed in , and we ’ re here doing our thing , ” the general manager , Demetri Hiotis , said . “ There ’ s a sense of pride . It ’ s 22 below but I still went to work , got my breakfast , got my coffee and doughnut . ”
 Commerce slowed throughout the Midwest , but the frigid condition were unlikely to exact a lingering economic toll . In a 2015 report , the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago concluded that winter weather had “ a significant , but short-lived effect on economic activity. ” But economist , the report suggested , have struggled to pinpoint the financial consequence of event like this week ’ s polar vortex , especially because regional and national economy are shaped by many factor .
 Perhaps the most distressing news wa that it wasn ’ t over . The most intense cold is expected overnight Wednesday into Thursday , said Ben Deubelbeiss , a meteorologist with the National Weather Service .
 After sunset on Wednesday , temperature were to drop again , sinking so low that the record for Chicago — minus 27 — could be reached . “ We were only a few degree away from that today and we might achieve it tonight , ” Mr. Deubelbeiss said .
 By Friday , the temperature should be in the 20 , still below normal for this time of year in Chicago , but no longer the bone-chilling cold of midweek .
 The extremely low temperature this week in part of the United States stand in sharp contrast to the trend toward warmer winter . But they may also be a result of warming .
 Emerging research suggested that a warming Arctic wa causing change in the jet stream and pushing polar air down — hence this week ’ s atypical chill over large swath of the Northeast and Midwest .
 Friederike Otto , an Oxford University climate scientist who study how specific weather event are exacerbated by global warming , said that while not all of these extreme event could be attributed to climate change , the profound change in the earth ’ s atmosphere raised “ the likelihood of a large number of extreme event . ”
 Throughout the Midwest , hospital reported patient arriving with symptom tied to the weather . The Illinois Department of Public Health said at least 30 people statewide had been to emergency room for frostbite or hypothermia-related visit by Wednesday morning .
 At Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis , the emergency department reported “ many patient ” who were injured or ill because of the weather . Frostbite case alone led to at least 13 admission .
 “ It ’ s busier than it would normally be , ” Dr. Douglas D. Brunette , an emergency room doctor in Minneapolis , said on Wednesday afternoon . “ But it ’ s not a mass casualty incident yet . ”
 Some form of transportation were snarled by the miserable cold . More than 2,500 flight were canceled across the United States , according to FlightAware .
 And Amtrak , which ordinarily run 55 train to or from Chicago each day , said it had canceled all of it Wednesday service involving the city and that most Thursday train would also be scratched . Given Chicago ’ s prominence in the Amtrak network , the decision wa expected to be felt across the country .
 In the region ’ s biggest city , many public transit system tried to press on . The Chicago Transit Authority said it “ L ” train had operated with some delay for a short time — and that worker had repaired one cracked rail — but were back to normal by afternoon .
 Metra , a commuter railroad in the Chicago region that had already announced modified schedule , said it had suspended electric train service indefinitely because of wire problem “ caused by harsh subfreezing temperature . ”
 Transit agency in Detroit , Milwaukee and the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul were trying to operate normally , but some warned customer of the potential for delay .
 Chicago will be a cold a the Arctic on Wednesday . We ’ ll show you why .
 Schools across a broad section of the nation canceled class a the dangerous freeze descended , and some said they were pondering canceling class again on Thursday . Many Midwestern institution lean toward staying open through snowstorm and cold spell , but this one wa different . For a second consecutive day , student on Wednesday were told to stay home at the University of South Dakota in Vermillion , where there wa a forecast high of minus 3 , relatively warm compared with other part of the Midwest .
 Hundreds of thousand of younger student in school across the country ’ s midsection also had no class . Administrators in school district in and around Cincinnati , worried about student walking to school or the possibility of a bus breaking down in the cold , called off class . In part of the region , the deep freeze meant several day without school , which quickly opened debate over how the missed day would be made up and whether summer vacation — seemingly so far-off now — might have to wait even longer .
 The cold snap had some other , more bewildering consequence . Residents across the Midwest reported hearing mysterious crashing sound , likely the result of a weather phenomenon known a a “ frost quake. ” During a sudden deep freeze , water in the soil can turn to ice and rapidly expand , causing sudden crack in the ground and a loud boom . They usually strike during the coldest part of the night .
 The deep cold brought other unfamiliar sound too : Odd , sudden creak and groan of porch and even building . Moans from frigid car engine . Whirring , drumming whine of wind against window and wall .
 On Wednesday morning , a few Chicago resident embraced the bone-chilling temperature . At Montrose Harbor on Chicago ’ s North Side , Iggy Ignoffo stood at the edge of Lake Michigan , wearing sunglass and a warm cap , hand stuffed in his pocket .
 “ I could see Venus , Jupiter and the moon a little while ago , ” he said , pointing to the sky . “ Beautiful. ” Sea smoke rose from the lake , the result of extremely cold air blowing over warmer water .
 The harbor wa hardly deserted : A stream of curious people ducked in and out of their car , snapping picture , taking a brief frolic in the snow .
 Mr. Ignoffo and his wife come down to the harbor all the time , he said , one of the most photogenic spot in the city .
 This time , she stayed in the car .

 By Joseph Berger
 The main highway between Johannesburg and Cape Town take traveler through the Great Karoo , a vast desert of reddish-brown earth speckled with scrub vegetation and seemingly populated by nothing more than a loping springbok or two . Few overseas visitor venture off the road .
 Yet a 20-mile byway lead miragelike to an oasis of sort , a dusty Afrikaans dorp , or farming village , in a surprisingly fertile patch watered by a stream flowing down the northern slope of the soaring Swartberg Mountains . It ’ s like suddenly coming across Brigadoon while hiking in the Scottish highland or spying the Emerald City after a long trek on the Yellow Brick Road .
 The village , Prince Albert , sometimes ha the look of a sleepy frontier settlement out of the old American West , but it is known among travel connoisseur for pristine example of 19th-century Cape Dutch architecture , with their signature rounded gable , and for tasty fig and olive , and grazing sheep that are raised for mohair and the most tender lamb . Improbably , in recent decade , a lively colony of artist and craft maker ha sprung up there .
 At the urging of a South African-born friend , my wife and I detoured off the N1 highway and spent several day exploring Prince Albert , which wa named after Queen Victoria ’ s consort . We were quickly beguiled by it languid charm , and we recalled the grace note of Greenwich Village and Chelsea in a compact town that ha a dozen art gallery and craft shop , and plainspoken restaurant that let you feel like you are dining in your grandmother ’ s kitchen .
 Of course there ’ s ambivalence in trumpeting Prince Albert because what make it exceptional is it aura of being undiscovered . Nevertheless , tourist are increasingly finding their way there just a the village is increasingly finding way to entice European , Asian and American traveler who can now visit South Africa without the discomfort of spending money in a land under the chokehold of apartheid .
 Frankly , we didn ’ t do much more than stroll the colorful main road , swim at our lodge ’ s pool , and gaze at the backdrop of soaring mountain in daylight and an astronomer ’ s dream of a starlit sky at night . The adventure of driving the dizzying switchbacks of a gravel mountain pas straddled by craggy pinnacle is a reason some traveler will take the long way via Prince Albert toward the fabled , lush Garden Route on the Indian Ocean coast . We took a similar path , though nervous about driving under the British left-side-of-the-road system along sheer-drop cliff , we chose a gentler paved mountain pas . My wife , a native who left South Africa 50 year ago but return every few year to visit family , need to renew her communion with the landscape whose beauty is lodged inextricably in her soul .
 The spine of Church Street is graced with more than a dozen Cape Dutch building , some draped in bougainvillea and adorned with tropical plant — fynbos , protea or cactus flower . But wherever we paused reminded u what a curious and unlikely spot Prince Albert is .
 We came across a row of five stout stump of 130-year-old blue gum tree that are known a “ the Burghers of Prince Albert. ” They look like lumpy monster out of Disney ’ s “ Fantasia ” and were gently reshaped in 2007 by the chisel of a village artist , Richard John Forbes , and four apprentice so they could become historical monument and , a a brochure informed u , take “ art out of the gallery . ”
 “ There ’ s definitely one with a tummy , and another , dare I say it , a bottom ! Kurt Steiner , a gallery owner , told u . “ The townsfolk are very divided in opinion . There are those who believe in Richard ’ s approach , and others even more fervently think the carving to be nothing le than desecration . ”
 We encountered an antique wagon permanently parked in front of the village museum a a reminder of the 18th-century pioneer who crossed the Karoo and the Swartbergs to farm . Nearby we passed the Showroom theater , built in 2013 in streamlined Art Deco by a local filmmaker who worked on the movie “ The Long Walk to Freedom , ” about Nelson Mandela ’ s struggle to end apartheid . ( It wa showing more lighthearted fare when we were there . ) We even came across a yoga studio , evidence of the village ’ s more recent resident .
 At the Watershed , a building housing a row of gallery , we studied photograph by Jürgen Schadeberg , a German expatriate who settled in Johannesburg and built a career out of photographing the struggle of South African black , particularly such hero a Nelson Mandela . As a photographer for Drum , a South African magazine , he trained a generation of black photographer who captured such image a the humiliating “ Tauza ” dance that naked prisoner were forced to perform to show guard they had no weapon .
 Silver print , signed by the artist , were on sale — for $ 4,800 each . They included the iconic one of Mandela , a the nation ’ s president , visiting his prison cell on Robben Island in 1994 and a smiling young Mandela outside a 1958 trial in which he and 50 others were accused of treason , though found not guilty .
 There were work by local artist like J.P. Meyer , who paint blurry , sepia-toned scene of men and boy in athletic pose . Watershed also sell pillow whose cover feature more whimsical Schadeberg photograph like that of an African jazz trio wreathed in a nightclub ’ s cigarette smoke . We came away with a shapely ceramic vase whose design of pink fleck wa created by Mr. Meyer . It now sits in our living room .
 Prince Albert is home to 30 painter , sculptor , designer and craft maker , Mr. Steiner , Watershed ’ s owner , informed u . They are drawn by the village ’ s serenity and seclusion . Their painting and sculpture are available down the main road at the Gallery , which also ha a busy cafe .
 When I asked Mr. Steiner when Prince Albert became an artist ’ s colony , his answer wa gently admonishing of a Western perspective : “ The first artist to make their mark , ” he said , “ were the Khoi-San who interpreted this arid ancient stretch of territory on the wall of cave and rock face . ”
 Khoi-San is the catchall term for two group of southern Africa ’ s indigenous black who are not speaker of Bantu language , a the majority Zulu and Xhosa are . Known for the clicking sound of their consonant , they had herded , foraged and hunted along the Swartberg slope for thousand of year until they were gradually displaced by Bantu expansion some 1,500 year ago , and then pushed out by musket-wielding white settler in the mid-18th century . The settler derogatorily called them Hottentots ( Khoi ) and Bushmen ( San ) . Their descendant today number about 400,000 and are scattered around southern Africa , principally in arid area like the Kalahari .
 The Fransie Pienaar Museum ha photograph of rock painting but is short on Khoi-San history . Rock painting , which were done with ingredient like eland blood and egg white , depict elephant , eland and other animal a well a procession of hunter and other scene of daily life . For those who have the time , there are a number of area across South Africa where a visitor can see actual rock painting , a prime location being the Cederberg mountain range two hour north of Cape Town . It ha more than 500 painting site , including a two-and-a-half mile rock-art trail and others accessible by hiker .
 The room of the Pienaar museum chronicle the story of Prince Albert ’ s “ founding ” in 1762 , a century after Dutch trader first came to this part of Africa , and are stuffed with 19th- and early-20th-century tool , dishware , telephone , typewriter , musical instrument , gun and other settler gadget . After crossing the Karoo ( a Khoisan word meaning desert ) by wagon , the farmer Zacharias and Dina De Beer planted fruit orchard , vineyard and wheat field . Other farmer followed and by 1855 the village could support a Dutch Reformed minister . A steepled church wa built 10 year later , and it still dominates the village .
 You learn from the museum that a nearby railroad line from Cape Town , the carving of the tortuous pas through the Swartbergs , a short-lived boom in ostrich feather for Europeans and a gold rush that fizzled all contributed to the growth of the village , which today ha 7,000 inhabitant , roughly 86 percent of mixed-race , 11 percent white and 2 percent black .
 Back outside , it is hard not to be struck by the sharp contrast , even in the new South Africa , between the comfortable routine and living quarter of white resident and tourist , and the more pinched life and flimsy shack of the mixed-race and black resident who work in the hotel , shop and farm that are owned and managed by white . On the street , barefoot child sometimes pose for photograph , hoping for a few rand .
 Prince Albert is known for it food and on our stroll we indulged . Sitting in the shade of a quiet side garden of the Lazy Lizard cafe , we munched on crisp loaf of homemade bread and a Karoo Plate , stocked with a cornucopia of the Karoo ’ s offering — lamb , cheese , Bulgarian yogurt , fig and olive .
 The source of the yogurt and cheese is Prince Albert ’ s landmark Gay ’ s Guernsey Dairy . Gay van Hasselt welcome visitor with a jaunty flair , recalling how she started the farm , in 1990 with three cow and a stone kraal ( barn ) . She now ha 50 cow . She is proud that the villager got used to thinking of yogurt , sometimes sweetened with flavor like strawberry — not a vrot melk — milk gone bad , but a a tart treat .
 When the January desert heat proved enervating , we returned to our inn , De Bergkant Lodge , built in 1858 for a newlywed couple , one of 14 local building declared historic monument , and swam lap to the sound of birdsong . The Swiss owner , Michi and Renate Soennichsen , dote on their guest .
 Both the restaurant they recommended were of high caliber and cost no more than an inexpensive Manhattan spot . At the Olive Branch , a cozy , unpretentious room , Hendry Olivier , the chef , explained how he slow-cooked the lamb for four hour . After tasting it , we concluded there must be a virtue in grazing in a desert .
 Somewhat more offbeat wa Karoo Kombuis — or Karoo Kitchen — which is in a simple cottage on a back street . It ha just three table with checkered tablecloth in the front room and three in the back room . A blackboard on the narrow patio serf a the menu but offer only three entree — though you can order any two in smaller portion . The restaurant ’ s other rule are cash only , bring booze and find the toilet through the kitchen .

 The place is run efficiently and with zest by veteran of South African Airways , Theunis Botha , who wa a purser , and Denise Potter , who wa an air hostess . Now he doe the cooking and wait on table while she , always outfitted in a colorful caftan and head scarf wrapped around her forehead , is the maître d ’ , greeting diner and asking their preference .
 The eclectic décor look like it wa salvaged from a vintage clothing shop , with one wall flaunting a line of high-heeled shoe and another flamboyant sun hat . My wife had a chicken pie , I some roast lamb and lamented not having room for the baboutie , a South African spiced meatloaf . We finished off the meal with a spongy cake called malva pudding , a national specialty . The flavorful dish and relaxed , quirky ambience made for an exceedingly pleasurable experience .
 For our entire stay , the pace wa restful , the charm small but exquisite , the scenery and flora enchanting . A middle-aged couple from Lincolnshire , England , whom we schmoozed with over breakfast , informed u that they have come to Prince Albert for three week every year for the past 15 year .
 At first , we wondered how anyone could spend three week in such a remote , sleepy backwater . But after a few day in Prince Albert , we emphatically understood .

 The Oscar winner say , “ I wa masquerading a an actor. ” Now she ’ s focused on seeing what come next for her lifestyle company , Goop . Maybe psychedelics ?

 As an actress , Gwyneth Paltrow wa embraced by fan and critic , winning an Oscar for her leading role in “ Shakespeare in Love. ” As a businesswoman , Ms. Paltrow ha received decidedly mixed review .
 Many deride her lifestyle brand , Goop , a little more than an overhyped e-commerce platform peddling pseudoscience and bauble . California regulator secured a $ 145,000 settlement from Goop last year after suing the company for false advertising , including claim that a $ 66 vaginal jade egg could balance hormone , increase bladder control and regulate menstrual cycle .
 Ms. Paltrow is unbowed . Goop is now worth some $ 250 million , revenue are growing and Ms. Paltrow is looking to Disney for inspiration , visualizing a company that make money through online retail , offline experience , ad partnership and more .
 Ms. Paltrow grew up around show business . Her father wa the producer Bruce Paltrow , who died in 2002 , and her mother is the actress Blythe Danner . This pedigree make it all the harder for some people to accept that she is now a chief executive fully engaged in running her own business . Sometimes , she told me , people ask , “ Who ’ s the silent male person who ’ s helping her ? ”
 There is no secret man running Goop . Instead , Ms. Paltrow herself is fluent in the intricacy of her business , speaking in detail about the tech stack , contextual commerce strategy and email service provider that power Goop .
 And still , G.P . — a she is known to friend — remains every bit the celebrity . On the day we met , she started the day on “ Good Morning America ” promoting a new cookbook , and ended it singing karaoke on “ The Tonight Show ” with Jimmy Fallon .
 When our interview wa over , she exited the building into a crush of paparazzo , before being whisked into a waiting black S.U.V . This interview , which wa condensed and edited for clarity , wa conducted in New York City .
 What wa it like growing up around show business ?
 I would see my mother on stage a a little girl , and she looked like a superhero . She looked like she wa channeling the force of the universe . And I just wanted to do that . So I followed in her footstep . Acting is a very entrepreneurial career . You have to sort of connect to that level of self belief that entrepreneur have to have . This abject , sometimes naïve , occasionally stupid amount of self belief .
 How did your mom feel about you wanting to follow in her footstep ?
 She always said , “ Oh , please don ’ t be an actress. ” She wa pleading with me to leverage my intellectual self more than my artistic self , and I think she wa just trying to protect me from a lot of rejection . It can be a heartbreaking career .
 So what wa it like trying to get started a an actor ?
 My first purview of management wa on set , because — and I think other female actor would agree with me — part of your role is just to sort of maintain culture .
 What do you mean ?
 We ’ re female . So we are kind of channeling the energy for the set and correcting imbalance . If there wa ever any discord , especially between men , I felt it wa my job to sort of balance the energy a little bit . Also , a in most industry , it ’ s predominantly male . Sometimes you would be the girl in a male cast , and could bring femininity and temper some of the male stuff .
 Does that hold true in business a well ? Is it the same at Goop ?
 Oh , completely . I think it ’ s both intentional and not intentional . The provenance of the company is such that when I went to go monetize it , the people who were drawn to it were not Silicon Valley male . So the great talent that I attracted wa female .
 O.K . Is there any analogy between either the producer role and the C.E.O . role ?
 My dad wa a benevolent , tough Jewish bos . He wa very loved for the most part , and he gave me a template for how one lead , consciously or unconsciously .
 So what ’ s the balance that you try to strike a the leader of the company ?
 With every iteration of the company , I have to start completely at square one again .
 How so ?
 When you ’ re in the family stage and your company ha just nine people or whatever , it ’ s much different than trying to manage and maintain a culture of 250 people . I have no experience at this . It ’ s almost like I have to unlearn thing , relearn thing , start over .
 What have you had to unlearn ?
 When a start-up start , it ’ s full of feminine energy , even if it ’ s an all male start-up . Right ? Because it ’ s collaborative , it ’ s emotional , it ’ s passionate , it ’ s instinctual . Those are all feminine quality . And then a it scale , you have to put some rule in place . And so that ’ s where the masculine come in . And you have compliance and H.R . and all these thing that are putting structure to the business , which is super important . So unlearning some of the old kind of feminine way , trying to apply the right kind of masculinity , and seeing if it ’ s possible to really still lead from that feminine place , is what I think about .
 What is Goop all about ?
 We want to always be moving culture forward with what we do in the content and in the offering and also create conversation and forum to help eliminate shame . I think a lot of woman experience a lot of shame in their life . The more we talk about thing that are sometimes uncomfortable , that are sometimes unknown , it might resonate with somebody . And then we might help them shed a little bit of that feeling .
 Is Goop just a brand for woman ?
 It is right now . But I don ’ t want to eliminate men . And more and more , to tell you the truth , men tell me , “ We really need that same kind of content , and we want the same kind of product . ”
 How is your thinking about what product and service you recommend evolving ? There have been some well-known flop .
 When we talk about something that is incendiary , I always see in six month other people starting to write about it , and 18 month later , business popping up around it . It ’ s always confirmation to me that we ’ re on the right track . I mean , when I did my gluten-free cookbook in 2015 , the press wa super negative and there were personal attack about what I wa feeding my child and what kind of mother I am . Now the gluten-free market is huge .
 Or conscious uncoupling . People were like , “ This is insane , you ’ re crazy. ” And now it ’ s sort of talked about a a thing that people think might be possible for them . And I ’ m always fascinated by why talk about female sexuality or female genitalia make people so angry . The idea that a woman might have autonomy around her own sexual health or her own feeling , why is that threatening ?
 But some of the thing on your site stray into the realm of pseudoscience that may be not only unproven , but potentially dangerous .
 When we were young and not even monetizing the business and just sort of creating content , we didn ’ t necessarily understand anything about claim . We just thought , “ Oh , this is a cool alternative modality , let ’ s write about it. ” Of course we ’ ve made some mistake along the way , but we ’ ve never been prescriptive . We ’ ve never said , “ You should try this , ” or “ This works. ” We ’ re just saying , “ Wow , this is interesting , let ’ s have a Q. and A. with this person who practice this. ” And then that somehow get translated into , “ Gwyneth say you should do this . ”
 Do you see yourself a an actor who developed a career a a lifestyle entrepreneur , or a lifestyle entrepreneur who happened to have a career a an actor ?
 I wa masquerading a an actor .
 You must get request for all sort of thing all the time . How do you say no ?
 I am still very much in the “ yes ” phase of my life , probably to my detriment sometimes . But having the platform that I do put me in this position to be able to share whatever lesson I ’ ve learned over time . I think I have some maturing to do before I get to the “ no ” phase .
 How have you learned to become a C.E.O . ?
 Predominantly by making mistake and talking to mentor . You can ’ t know what you don ’ t know , and I certainly wa never in a position to understand , like , 99 percent of the thing that I had to learn from an operation standpoint . So I made mistake left , right and center .
 Can you give an example ?
 Our whole e-commerce technology ha been so problematic from the beginning because I had no idea about technology whatsoever . Our original tech stack wa this Frankenstein .
 Some people have accused Goop of being an elitist brand , but you ’ ve pushed back . Can you explain your thinking here ?
 A lot of people hear , “ Hey , you could eat a bit better or exercise a bit more. ” But they don ’ t want to take responsibility for themselves . So it ’ s easier to be critical of an entity or a person who is suggesting that , than it is to start making small , perhaps uncomfortable shift in their life .
 The true tenet of wellness are all free . Being in nature , meditating , eating whole food . If you told our grandparent that eating whole , natural food wa elitist , they would have thought you were crazy .
 Have you ever gone on a meditation retreat ?
 I have . I went on a silent meditation retreat at a monastery in the Catskills a long time ago . There wa chanting in the morning with all the monk , which wa heaven . And a matcha tea ceremony at the end , which wa the best part .
 How wa the experience for you ?
 I found the prison of internalization really hard . It wa more than just the silence . I had a lot of stuff resurfacing .
 Stuff come up .
 It wa nut .
 So what ’ s the next big thing ? What ’ s the next gluten free or conscious uncoupling ?
 I think how psychedelics affect health and mental health and addiction will come more into the mainstream .
 Have you used psychedelics ?
 I ’ ve never done it . I ’ m terrified . Did you ?
 When I wa younger , yes . It led me to meditation .
 I mean there ’ s undeniably some link between being in that state and being connected to some other universal cosmic something .
 It change your mind . It change the way you think .
 Yeah , and how do we do that a a culture ? How do we evolve ? What is the next iteration of the culture a it pertains to the way we think about thing , the degree of openness to which we think about thing and process thing ?
 What about ibogaine , that shrub from Gabon ?
 I don ’ t know about this . Is this the next big thing ?
 I don ’ t know . Don ’ t take my word for it .
 Well , I ’ m going to read about it on Goop .
 Yeah , you sure are .

 It ’ s Friday .
 Alternate-side parking : in effect today , suspended Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day .
 Till now , winter ha been gentle .
 We — you , dear reader , me and the people who bring you this newsletter — have been spared the season ’ s worst . But we are getting hammered with snow and sleet and more snow and freezing cold .
 Here is the deal .
 First , look out your window . It may still be snowing .
 It will not snow much — maybe an inch — and should stop by midmorning or briefly turn to rain a the temperature climb toward 40 . ( This being a New York Friday , give yourself lot of time to commute . )
 Do not let this opening salvo fool you .
 Saturday evening , more snow will fall .
 This will be a “ bigger ” and more “ powerful ” storm than today ’ s , according to Faye Morrone , an intern at the National Weather Service who helpfully picked up the phone despite the federal shutdown .
 Four inch may fall in New York City . Northern suburb could see 10 inch . Early Sunday , the snow will turn to rain in the city .
 Then come the cold blast .
 Temperatures will plummet Sunday afternoon , changing the last of the precipitation back to sleet or snow .
 [ Read about why there ha not been a much snow a normal . ]
 Sunday night , the temperature will fall to around 8 degree — the lowest since last January . Wind chill will drop below zero .
 On Monday , it will get up to only about 17 , then back down to 10 .
 By Tuesday , when you emerge from your igloo , the mercury will hit 30 degree . If there ’ s still snow , maybe you can ski to work .

 Last month , Benjamin Brafman , a prominent defense lawyer , walked into the State Supreme Court building in Manhattan with his client Harvey Weinstein .
 The pint-size lawyer and the hulking former movie producer walked past flickering camera and score of reporter . At the time they were a team .
 But after a week of report about the two men bumping head , Mr. Brafman filed paper yesterday withdrawing a Mr. Weinstein ’ s counsel .
 A joint statement said the two men “ agreed to part way amicably . ”
 But they have been at odds after Mr. Weinstein reached out to other lawyer in advance of his sex-crimes trial , slated to start in May , said a person familiar with the case . The argument turned into shouting match , the person said .
 Assuming the judge approves the change , Mr. Weinstein plan to introduce his new legal team next week .
 Mr. Brafman , Mr. Weinstein and the producer ’ s spokesman , Juda Engelmayer , declined to comment .

 My colleague Corey Kilgannon writes :
 Just a the book seemed about to close on Westsider Rare & Used Books , one of the last independent bookstore on the Upper West Side , there came a plot twist .
 Dorian Thornley , a co-owner , had decided to close the shop , on Broadway near 80th Street , citing a sale slump .
 The news site West Side Rag ran an article with an all-to-familiar theme : Another mom-and-pop bookstore bite the dust . But it included a musing remark by Mr. Thornley that if “ somebody did a crowd-funder and raised $ 50,000 , ” he ’ d keep it open .
 “ Don ’ t see that happening though , ” he added .
 He may be proven wrong .
 A customer , Bobby Panza , started a GoFundMe campaign , and faster than you can say “ You ’ ve Got Mail , ” by this morning bookstore lover had pitched in more than $ 35,000 .
 The Westsider is “ like Zabar ’ s or Barney Greengrass , ” Mr. Panza said . “ It ’ s part of the soul of the Upper West Side , and I support small business , the small guy who are getting boxed out . ”
 Mr. Thornley said that if the fund-raiser got to $ 50,000 , he could stay open at least another year by paying off rent for several month and stocking more book .
 “ Then we ’ ll be in good shape , ” he said , adding that selling book these day and paying Manhattan rent is never a rosy business plan .
 “ It ’ s not a Disney movie , ” he said .
 It ’ s Friday — save your local bookstore .
 Also : We ’ re off Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day . Here ’ s his last speech , annotated . See you on Tuesday .
 Dear Diary :
 I wa walking north on First Avenue when I decided to cross the street to look at the menu posted in a restaurant window .
 I wa about halfway across the street when a woman came up next to me .
 “ Excuse me , ” she said , “ do you know where I can pick up the Q train ? ”
 “ I ’ m really sorry , but I have no idea , ” I said . “ I don ’ t live in the city . ”
 She took a few step , and then she turned around .
 “ But you look like you belong here , ” she said .

 Featuring a Russian spy murder , a self-immolation , gun-toting government thug and other fanciful plot device , “ Project Blue Book , ” History ’ s popular new series on the Air Force ’ s program to investigate and debunk U.F.O.s , is not your historian ’ s Project Blue Book .
 We viewed the first six episode from the standpoint of writer who have long worked on the serious side of U.F.O.s . We broke the December 2017 New York Times exclusive on a secret Pentagon program investigating the phenomenon , with our colleague Helene Cooper . Leslie Kean wrote the Times 2010 best-seller “ U.F.O.s : Generals , Pilots and Government Officials Go On the Record. ” Ralph Blumenthal ha written about U.F.O.s for Vanity Fair a well a The Times .
 So , despite the embellishment , we were interested to discover parallel between the TV version and the historical and current reality .
 [ Read the 2017 Times report on the Pentagon ’ s secret U.F.O . program . ]
 The History series predictably sensationalizes and overdramatizes case investigation and the historical figure involved , adding many story element that simply never happened . It ’ s already hard enough for those trying to understand the truth about government involvement with U.F.O.s without mixing fact and fiction .
 Nonetheless , melodrama aside , the real story is there :
 Project Blue Book wa the code name for an Air Force program set up in 1952 , after numerous U.F.O . sighting during the Cold War era , to explain away or debunk a many report a possible in order to mitigate possible panic and shield the public from a genuine national security problem : an apparently technological phenomenon that wa beyond human control and wa not Russian , yet represented an unfathomable potential threat .
 The central character of the TV series , the prominent astronomer J. Allen Hynek , played by Aidan Gillen , wa recruited a Blue Book ’ s scientific consultant and wa indeed initially committed to explaining away flying saucer a natural phenomenon or mistaken identification . But he gradually realized that the bizarre object were real and needed further scientific attention . ( Though he never saw a supposed alien creature floating in a tank or crashed in a plane while recreating a reported U.F.O . dogfight , a depicted in the series . )
 While Hynek wa involved , Blue Book compiled report of 12,618 sighting of unidentified flying object , of which 701 remain unexplained to this day .
 But what ’ s most important to study during that era is what occurred outside Project Blue Book , to the extent that it ha been revealed . When we reported on the Pentagon ’ s Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program , which began in 2007 , we offered a glimpse into a similar scenario today : military case being investigated and filmed without the public knowing . This time , however , there wa no public agency to accommodate report of incident , even when hundred of witness were involved .
 We learned through document from the Pentagon program , and from interview with participant , that the mystery of the elusive flying object is still far from solved , and that not enough wa being done to address that problem almost 50 year since the close of Blue Book .
 It all began in 1947 . Lt. General Nathan Twining , the commander of Air Materiel Command , sent a secret memo on “ Flying Discs ” to the commanding general of the Army Air Forces at the Pentagon . Twining stated that “ the phenomenon reported is something real and not visionary or fictitious. ” The silent , disc-like object demonstrated “ extreme rate of climb , maneuverability ( particularly in roll ) , and motion which must be considered evasive when sighted or contacted by friendly aircraft and radar . ”
 A new project , code-named “ Sign , ” based at Wright Field ( now Wright-Patterson Air Force Base ) outside Dayton , Ohio , wa given the mandate to collect U.F.O . report and ass whether the phenomenon wa a threat to national security . With Russia ruled out a the source , the staff wrote a top secret “ Estimate of the Situation , ” concluding that , based on the evidence , U.F.O.s most likely had an interplanetary origin .
 According to government official at the time , the estimate wa rejected by General Hoyt Vandenberg , the Air Force chief of staff . From then on , the proponent of the off-planet hypothesis lost ground , with Vandenberg and others insisting that conventional explanation be found .
 Project Sign eventually evolved into Project Blue Book , with the aim of convincing the public that flying saucer could be explained .
 Yet behind the scene , authority grappled with something sobering : well-documented U.F.O . encounter involved multiple trained observer , radar data , photograph , mark on the ground and physical effect on airplane .
 In 1952 , the office of Maj. Gen. John Samford , the Air Force director of intelligence , briefed the F.B.I. , saying it wa “ not entirely impossible that the object sighted may possibly be ship from another planet such a Mars , ” according to government document . Air Intelligence had largely ruled out an earthly source , the F.B.I . memo reported .
 National defense concern were mounting a well . After Air Force plane scrambled to intercept brilliant object seen and picked up on radar over Washington in 1952 , Samford called a news conference to calm the country .
 He announced that between 1,000 and 2,000 report had been analyzed and that most had been explained . “ However , ” he conceded , a certain percentage “ have been made by credible observer of relatively incredible thing . It is this group of observation that we now are attempting to resolve . ”
 He said no conclusion had been drawn , but played down any “ conceivable threat ” to the United States .
 Later that year , however , H. Marshall Chadwell , the assistant director of scientific intelligence for the C.I.A. , concluded in a memo to the C.I.A . director , Walter Bedell Smith , that “ sighting of unexplained object at great altitude and traveling at high speed in the vicinity of major U.S. defense installation are of such nature that they are not attributable to natural phenomenon or known type of aerial vehicle . ”
 By 1953 , authority were concerned that communication channel were becoming dangerously clogged by hundred of U.F.O . report . Even false alarm could be perilous , defense agency worried , since the Soviets might take advantage of the situation by simulating or staging a U.F.O . wave and then attack .
 Documents show the C.I.A . then devised a plan for a “ national policy , ” a to “ what should be told the public regarding the phenomenon , in order to minimize risk of panic . ”
 After a closed-door session with a scientific advisory panel chaired by H.P . Robertson from the California Institute of Technology , the C.I.A . issued a secret report recommending a broad educational program for all intelligence agency , with the aim of “ training and debunking . ”
 Training meant more public education on how to identify known object in the sky . “ The use of true case showing first the ‘ mystery ’ and then the ‘ explanation ’ would be forceful , ” the report said . Debunking “ would be accomplished by mass medium such a television , motion picture , and popular article . ”
 That plan involved using psychologist , advertising expert , amateur astronomer and even Disney cartoon to create propaganda to reduce public interest . And civilian U.F.O . group should be “ watched , ” the report stated , because of their “ great influence on mass thinking if widespread sighting should occur . ”
 The Robertson Panel Report wa classified until 1975 , five year after Blue Book wa shut down . But it legacy endures in the aura of ridicule surrounding U.F.O . report , inhibiting scientific progress .
 “ The implication in the Panel Report wa that U.F.O.s were a nonsense ( nonscience ) matter , to be debunked at all cost , ” Hynek wrote . “ It made the subject of U.F.O.s scientifically unrespectable . ”
 Hynek , the former U.F.O . skeptic , eventually concluded that they were a real phenomenon in dire need of scientific attention , with hundred of case in the Blue Book file still unexplained . Even many of the “ closed ” case were resolved with ridiculous , often infuriating explanation , sometimes by Hynek himself .
 “ The entire Blue Book operation wa a foul-up based on the categorical premise that the incredible thing reported could not possibly have any basis in fact , ” he wrote in the 1970s , when he wa finally free to speak the truth .
 When Blue Book closed in late 1969 , the Air Force flatly lied to the American people , issuing a fact sheet claiming that no U.F.O . had ever been a threat to national security ; that U.F.O.s did not represent “ technological development or principle beyond the range of present day scientific knowledge ” ; and that there wa no evidence that they were “ extraterrestrial vehicle . ”
 ( Just a few year earlier , in 1967 , a glowing red oval-shaped object hovered over Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana , and all 10 of the facility ’ s underground nuclear missile became disabled almost simultaneously while the U.F.O . wa present , according to interview with witness and official government report . Technicians could find no conventional explanation . )
 But whatever the Air Force told the public , it didn ’ t actually stop investigating U.F.O.s . A once-classified memo , issued secretly in October 1969 , a few month before the termination of Blue Book , revealed that regulation were already in place to investigate U.F.O . report that were “ not part of the Blue Book system. ” The memo , written by Carroll H. Bolender , an Air Force brigadier general , went on to say that “ report of U.F.O.s which could affect national security would continue to be handled through the standard Air Force procedure designed for this purpose . ”
 Clearly , government agency continued to have some level of involvement in U.F.O . investigation in the decade following — and to the present . Despite government statement to the contrary , once-secret official document include detailed report of dramatic U.F.O . event abroad . Many case at home were not investigated , including a 2006 event in which a disc-shaped object hovered over O ’ Hare Airport for more than five minute and shot straight up through the cloud at an incredible speed .
 Our reporting in 2017 , which led to briefing for member of Congressional committee , showed that not much ha changed since the close of Project Blue Book .
 Scientists may know more about the behavior and characteristic of U.F.O.s and are closer to understanding the physic of how the technology operates , according to A.A.T.I.P . document and interview . But the government still make every attempt to keep investigation and conclusion secret , while denying any involvement to American citizen .

 After two year of bitter patent battle across three continent , Apple and the chip maker Qualcomm have settled all of their dispute , Don Clark and Daisuke Wakabayashi of the NYT report .
 • The company “ agreed to dismiss all litigation between them worldwide . They added that they had reached a six-year agreement for Apple to pay unspecified royalty on Qualcomm ’ s patent . ”
 • “ That deal , which wa effective a of April 1 , included a two-year option for an extension , plus a multiyear agreement for Qualcomm to supply chip to Apple . In addition , Apple will make an undisclosed one-time payment to Qualcomm . ”
 Hours later , Intel said it would stop selling smartphone modem chip — including 5G model that Apple had been expected to use next year — citing “ no clear path to profitability. ” Nikkei Asian Review report , citing unnamed source , that Apple had been concerned about relying solely on Intel for it 5G chip .
 And Qualcomm ’ s share jumped 23 percent after it said it expected $ 2 per share in additional revenue from the settlement .
 “ I ’ m floored , ” said Patrick Moorhead , president and principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy , a technology analysis firm . “ Qualcomm got the bigger win because it had the most to lose and the most to gain . And it ended today . ”
 “ How much the deal might affect people ’ s phone price will not be clear until more financial detail of the settlement are disclosed . But the effect on the price of individual handset is not likely to be large , ” Mr. Clark and Mr. Wakabayashi write .
 More 5G news : Nokia want to take on Huawei on next-generation wireless infrastructure . And Huawei said that it ha no 5G contract from mainland China .
 Shares in Sprint tumbled over 7 percent yesterday after the WSJ reported that Justice Department staffer had concern about it proposed sale to T-Mobile USA .
 Justice Department official met with both carrier earlier this month to discus the merger , according to news report . They showed some skepticism about the structure of the transaction .
 But one man will decide whether to block the deal . That ’ s Makan Delrahim , the head of the Justice Department ’ s antitrust division — and it isn ’ t clear which way he is leaning .
 T-Mobile ’ s C.E.O. , John Legere , is pushing back . He tweeted that the WSJ ’ s description of the meeting , which had Justice Department staffer saying the deal wa “ unlikely to be approved a currently structured , ” wa “ simply untrue . ”
 The company still have about a month of regulatory review to wait out . And they could still make change to the transaction to win over Washington official .
 More : The White House is refusing House Democrats ’ request for any document about President Trump and the Justice Department review of AT & T ’ s takeover of Time Warner .
 The business of multibillion-dollar deal and complex derivative trade wasn ’ t Wall Street ’ s cash cow in the first quarter . That honor fell to bank branch , consumer apps and credit card , Robert Armstrong of the FT report .
 • “ Over the past 12 month , share in Morgan Stanley , which ha no retail unit , and Goldman Sachs , which ha only a tiny one , are the worst performing among the six big U.S. bank , having fallen 11 percent and 21 percent , respectively . ”
 • “ Conversely , JPMorgan and BofA , with the strongest retail unit , trade at the widest premium to tangible book value in the group . ”
 • “ ‘ Corporate and investment banking is not a source of growth , and asset management is not [ either ] . All the growth is coming from the retail bank , ’ said Charles Peabody of Portales Partners . ”
 • The big question , Mr. Armstrong writes , is how long this will last . Banks have kept deposit rate low even a the Fed ’ s rate have risen . But the difference between shorter-term and longer-term interest rate is narrowing , threatening that income .
 In the wake of two fatal crash , two influential shareholder advisory firm have recommended big change to Boeing ’ s board of director , including a partial demotion for Dennis Muilenberg , the C.E.O .
 Mr. Muilenberg should lose his role a chairman , I.S.S . and Glass Lewis said . The two proxy advisory firm , who hold sway over many institutional investor , often recommend having an independent chairman .
 Separating the role “ eliminates the conflict of interest that inevitably occurs when a C.E.O . is responsible for self-oversight , ” Glass Lewis wrote in it report to investor , according to the WSJ .
 Also under pressure : the head of Boeing ’ s audit committee , Lawrence Kellner . Glass Lewis want him removed for failing to foresee safety risk on the 737 Max plane .
 Boeing defended it current board and said it should decide it own leadership structure . “ The board is not aware of clear evidence demonstrating that splitting the C.E.O . and chairman role is good for all company in all circumstance , ” the company said in it proxy filing .
 Ads that ran alongside anti-vaccine content . Accusations of abetting child suicide . Viral content that showed pedophile were flourishing in comment section . YouTube ha had a rough time recently . Daisuke Wakabayashi of the NYT look at how it C.E.O. , Susan Wojcicki , is coping .
 • “ In an industry that celebrates eccentricity , Ms. Wojcicki present a exceedingly normal , bordering on boring , even a element of her digital realm burst into the real world in form that are increasingly grotesque and sometimes dangerous . ”
 • “ Political figure and tech luminary alike are castigating YouTube for not doing enough to rein in the crook , crackpot , racist , Russian agent and charlatan who call the platform home . New horror are ceaseless . ”
 • Now , “ YouTube want to remove the content that violates it policy more quickly and effectively ; promote better , more authoritative material and limit the spread of video that are potentially harmful but doe not break the rule . ”
 • “ I know we can do better , but we ’ re going to get there , ” she said in an interview . “ I own this problem , and I ’ m going to fix it . ”
 • Ms. Wojcicki is unlikely to be unseated anytime soon . While she technically report to Sundar Pichai , Google ’ s C.E.O. , she is one of the few people at the tech giant with “ walk-in access ” to Larry Page , Alphabet ’ s reclusive co-founder and C.E.O . “ She is not going anywhere , ” one Google executive told Mr. Wakabayashi .
 The Chinese economy steadied itself in the first three month of the year , after Beijing flooded the financial system with money to avoid a slowdown , Alexandra Stevenson of the NYT report .
 The world ’ s second largest economy wa 6.4 percent bigger in the first quarter than in the same period of 2018 , Ms. Stevenson report , citing figure provided by Chinese official . “ The pace matched that of the fourth quarter , when growth suffered a shopper pared back , the stock market slumped and private business pleaded for help . ”
 “ While economist generally regard China ’ s economic figure with skepticism , they point to other sign that the country ’ s current slowdown may have reached bottom . Other figure suggest shopper are back at the till , factory output is ticking up and the world , after several tough month , is buying more Chinese good . ”
 “ Beijing need such hopeful sign a it try to reach a trade deal with the Trump administration while under pressure to lift condition at home . ”
 But there ’ s a caveat . The improvement probably ha more to do with all that stimulus cash than with any sudden increase in business confidence . And it ’ s unclear how long the cash can keep flowing .
 More : As unlikely a it sound , some business leader and intellectual in China see President Trump — one of Beijing ’ s toughest critic — a a kind of savior for the nation .
 As a lawmaker , Mick Mulvaney tried to abolish the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau . And when the Trump administration made him it acting director , he steadily undercut it from within , Nick Confessore report in the NYT Magazine .
 • “ When Mulvaney took over , the fledgling C.F.P.B . wa perhaps Washington ’ s most feared financial regulator : It announced dozen of case annually against abusive debt collector , sloppy credit agency and predatory lender . ”
 • “ What he left behind is an agency whose very mission is now a matter of bitter dispute . ‘ The bureau wa constructed really deliberately to protect ordinary people , ’ say Lisa Donner , the head of Americans for Financial Reform . “ He ’ s taken it apart — dismantled it , piece by piece . ’ ”
 • “ Some career employee saw a kind of strategic ambiguity at work , designed to muddle decision-making and insulate Mulvaney a he neutered the agency ’ s enforcement work . ”
 • The deconstruction “ offer a case study in the Trump administration ’ s approach to transforming Washington , one in which strategic neglect and bureaucratic self-sabotage create version of agency that seem to run contrary to their basic premise . ”
 • This “ wasn ’ t just one of the Trump era ’ s most emblematic assault on the so-called administrative state , ” Mr. Confessore writes . It wa “ also , in part , an audition ” to become the White House chief of staff .
 Robert Jackson Jr. , the S.E.C. ’ s only Democratic commissioner , is expected to step down later this year .
 Ulrich Spiesshofer abruptly stepped down a C.E.O . of ABB after facing pressure from activist investor . He will be replaced in the interim by Peter Voser , the company ’ s chairman .
 Nissan ha reportedly abolished it “ office of the C.E.O. , ” a group of executive who worked for the chief executive .

 • Luciano Lliuya , el peruano que demanda a una empresa alemana por el cambio climático . Las comunidades de la Cordillera Blanca en el país andino viven temerosas de la avalanchas e inundaciones que está provocando la desglaciación relacionada con el cambio climático . En la últimas do décadas , por ejemplo , la cantidad de agua en la laguna de Palcacocha , cerca de Huaraz , ha aumentado en 3400 por ciento .
 Luciano Lliuya , vecino de la laguna , ha presentado una demanda en una corte alemana contra la mayor empresa energética de ese país exigiendo una compensación de 19.000 dólares por los gastos de contener la inundaciones . La suya forma parte de una nueva ola de demandas civiles que intentan que la empresas de combustible fósiles paguen por la devastación climática . La historia de Lliuya sirve para ilustrar la dificultades legales y la estrategias de los abogados que arguyen que quienes resulten más responsables del calentamiento global deben pagar por los daños .
 • Los primeros cien días de Bolsonaro . Tres me son muy poco para evaluar el desempeño de un mandatario , pero Jair Bolsonaro ha logrado en ese corto periodo desperdiciar una gran parte del capital político que lo llevó a la presidencia de Brasil . Aunque ha cumplido algunas de sus promesas de campaña , Bolsonaro tiene la popularidad más baja que cualquier presidente brasileño en su primer mandato desde los años ochenta , según una encuesta de Datafolha . Uno de cada tres encuestados dijo que le parecía que su presidencia era mala o pésima . “ Ya estamos en un periodo de estancamiento ” , comentó el legislador Kim Kataguiri , cuyo partido respaldó la candidatura de Bolsonaro . “ Los mercados pronostican que Brasil no podrá cumplir con sus obligaciones , controlar su deuda pública ni recibir inversiones ” .
 Por otro lado , la autoridades brasileñas investigan si la candidaturas de cinco mujeres fueron un modo ilícito del Partido Social Liberal de Bolsonaro para conseguir financiamiento político . Varios dirigentes del partido han sido acusados de registrar candidatas desconocidas para cobrar fondos destinados a aumentar la participación femenina El escándalo ya provocó la destitución de un miembro del gabinete de Bolsonaro .
 “ El gobierno colombiano debería considerar que sus ciudadanos merecen el mismo cuidado que los ciudadanos de Estados Unidos .

 It matter who you know , and in 1997 , the 21-year-old Jason Eagan knew almost no one in New York . But quality can indeed make up for quantity . One contact — the illustrator Ian Falconer , now of “ Olivia ” fame — ushered him into a glamorous downtown crowd . Another , Julie Taymor , pointed him toward a behind-the-scenes job on “ The Lion King . ”
 In the half a lifetime since he arrived from his native Los Angeles with dream of directing on Broadway , Mr. Eagan ha made himself into a vital New York someone for many other artist to know .
 For the past 15 year , he ha been the remarkably well-connected , stealthily low-profile , principal creative force shaping the innovative Off Broadway incubator Ars Nova . From it base on West 54th Street in Hell ’ s Kitchen , Mr. Eagan , the 43-year-old founding artistic director , ha built a formidable record a a spotter and nurturer of outside-the-box talent .
 He ’ s the guy who plucked an obscure Billy Eichner out of one Manhattan basement and an unknown Lin-Manuel Miranda out of another ; who discovered the alt-cabaret comedian Bridget Everett at midnight at a karaoke bar ; who looked upon the glorious excess of Dave Malloy ’ s nascent “ War and Peace ” musical , “ Natasha , Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812 , ” and said , in effect : “ More. ” “ Keep going. ” And “ Yes . ”
 “ The joy for me , ” Mr. Eagan explained over a glass of wine recently , “ is finding the thing — the person or the show — that ’ s completely mesmerizing . Then the job is to figure out what we can do with that . ”
 His genre-mashing taste is the unifying aesthetic at a company known for pop-culture-savvy experimentation , with a hipness that set it apart . In a theater industry reliant on the M.F.A . pipeline to replenish it talent supply , Mr. Eagan is the rare gatekeeper who actively seek out extraordinary artist on the fringe who need someone to help them through .
 “ Jason ’ s always three step ahead of the culture , ” said Mr. Eichner , who spent two year developing his overwrought , celebrity-obsessed “ Billy on the Street ” persona in monthly live talk show on Ars Nova ’ s stage , beginning in 2005 .
 Stardom wa still a long way away , but simply being there put him on the radar .
 Artist by artist , show by show , Ars Nova ha been filtering into the mainstream .
 You can see it in the alumnus roll of it playwriting residency , Play Group ; the inaugural bunch , formed in 2007 , includes such TV heavyweight a Elizabeth Meriwether ( “ New Girl ” ) , Beau Willimon ( “ House of Cards ” ) , Liz Flahive and Carly Mensch ( “ GLOW ” ) .
 You can see it in Ars Nova hit that lately have gone off into the wider world — like Bess Wohl ’ s “ Small Mouth Sounds , ” born in Play Group ; Jennifer Kidwell and Scott R. Sheppard ’ s “ Underground Railroad Game , ” which in January toured to Australia ; and the groundbreaking “ Comet , ” whose lauded transfer to Broadway in 2016 wa a glittering but bittersweet triumph .
 And you could see it one evening this month , when Mr. Miranda — also part of that first Play Group — took the stage of the Greenwich House Theater with his hip-hop improv group , Freestyle Love Supreme . With ticket priced at $ 1,000 to $ 2,500 , it wa a sold-out benefit for Ars Nova , celebrating it expansion to the former Barrow Street Theater in Greenwich Village . ( The Mad Ones ’ latest show , “ Mrs . Murray ’ s Menagerie , ” start performance there on March 26 . )
 [ What ’ s new onstage and off : Sign up for our Theater Update newsletter ]
 When Mr. Eagan first saw Freestyle Love Supreme , in 2004 , they were performing in the basement of the Drama Book Shop . Their eight-week Ars Nova run that fall wa Mr. Miranda ’ s first professional New York show , sharing a bill with a trapeze act .
 In 2005 , Mr. Eagan took the troupe to the HBO Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen , Colo. , to put them in front of an industry audience . Mr. Miranda wa his roommate on the trip , and when he suggested watching a movie , he handed Mr. Eagan a case of DVDs he ’ d brought .
 “ I started flipping through , and it ’ s all musical , ” said Mr. Eagan . “ It wa this penny-drop moment for me , where I wa like , ‘ Right : If you want to break the form , you have to know the form that you ’ re breaking . ’ ”
 For his part , Mr. Miranda doesn ’ t recall the DVDs , or that ( a Mr. Eagan say ) they settled on the TV version of Stephen Sondheim ’ s “ Passion . ”
 “ What I remember from the Aspen trip , ” he said , “ wa actually getting very sick , and Jason wa kind of the one who took care of me . He wa getting me soup so that I could then rap at high altitude .
 “ So he wa like my Aspen wife , ” Mr. Miranda added , cheerfully .
 In a series of hourslong interview for this story , Mr. Eagan wa thoughtful , funny and self-scrutinizing , with an appealing lack of pretense . These day he life in Bushwick , Brooklyn , with his partner of 13 year , Zach Shaffer , an actor ; their cat , Scout ; and their dog , Benny . But in 2003 , when Ars Nova ’ s founder , Jenny and Jon Steingart , hired him , he wa a 27-year-old with instruction to program performance that he felt passionate about .
 So he filled the 99-seat space with a nonstop mix of comedy , music and theater , whose creator ended up watching one another ’ s work — an organic , accidental cross-fertilization .
 As Ars Nova evolved — toning down the chaos of the early year , creating residency to bring artist into the fold , commissioning playwright and composer — it ha always been intended a both playground and launchpad .
 Dedicated to discovering artist and supporting them in the emergent stage of their career , it then aim to nudge them out the door . “ But we are terrible at saying goodbye , ” Mr. Eagan said .
 Ask the director Rachel Chavkin for a Jason Eagan story , and she flash back to her first big opening : “ Comet ” at Ars Nova , in 2012 . As they stood outside on 54th Street , Mr. Eagan talked her through what to expect from the attention to come — from critic and producer . He wa “ such a good caretaker of me at this huge moment of segue in my career , ” she said .
 Tending to others wa a skill he learned early , or at least that ’ s the way he think of his childhood , in the San Fernando Valley . His parent were high school sweetheart who taught tap dance together a teenager , and they married young . His mother wa 20 when she had him , his father 21 . Before he turned a year old , they split up .
 He remembers , when he wa small , feeling that he “ had to be a grown-up ” for his mother , because she had it hard enough , and flying alone to Northern California to visit his father , who wa gay and by then also out . Close to both of them , he didn ’ t let on when he overheard his mother say that his father wa H.I.V.-positive .
 Until his father sat him down to say that he wa sick , he quietly hoped it wasn ’ t true . His father ’ s death from AIDS in 1988 , when Jason had just turned 13 , wa the mostly secret trauma of his childhood , in an era when AIDS wa surrounded by stigma and silence . In eighth grade at a new school where he didn ’ t have any friend yet , he kept his sorrow to himself .
 His childhood wa also marked , though , by a sustaining love of music and performance — singing for year in child ’ s choir ; backing up REO Speedwagon , with some other kid , on the “ Goonies ” soundtrack ; being a supernumerary at Los Angeles Opera , starting in junior high . At his performing art high school — where he wa the mascot , a bewigged Alexander Hamilton — he gravitated toward musical theater , discovering almost by chance that he liked directing .
 Given his curious , lightning-fast mind and attention to detail , it ’ s surprising that he had no interest in formal education after that . His only college experience wa part of a single semester that he felt pressured into , until he decided it wa a waste of time . A leader now in a milieu where college , if not graduate school , is the rule , he make self-conscious joke about that blank on his résumé . But Mr. Eagan ha always charted his own path .
 If he had been a student somewhere , instead of a stage manager at Los Angeles Opera , he probably wouldn ’ t have met Ms. Taymor when she came to direct “ The Flying Dutchman. ” He wa only 19 , and she remembers him a talented and eager — while he remembers his thrill at her work , and the postcard he wrote relentlessly to stay in touch . As “ The Lion King ” got ready for Broadway , Disney Theatrical Productions hired him to manage the design studio .
 On his second night a a New Yorker , some people he ’ d met through his friend Mr. Falconer brought him along to an invite-only workshop by a friend of theirs . The show , almost a year before it opened Off Broadway , wa “ Hedwig and the Angry Inch , ” starring John Cameron Mitchell , who also wrote the book .
 Mr. Eagan would go on to direct “ Hedwig ” outside the city , and to stage-manage it in New York . In 2003 , he wa working for Mr. Mitchell on what would become the movie “ Shortbus ” when he got the Ars Nova job .
 He fell for it so hard that in his first two year , by choice , he didn ’ t take a day off . He sound genuinely happy about what he and the team there have built . Even after “ Great Comet ” — and the public fight with commercial producer over proper program credit on Broadway — the company ’ s agenda is unchanged .
 But if you ask Mr. Eagan about his future , or his personal ambition , he turn pleasantly vague .
 Over a long lunch one February afternoon in the West Village , he reminisced about his early day in the city . Back in the ’ 90 , he said , he wa out every night , basking in the gay culture downtown , with “ drag and go-go and burlesque and everything going on in every bar . ”
 All of that wa theater ; all of that wa formative . But a much a it piqued his curiosity , he felt a constant fear deep inside . The way his father suffered toward the end of his life , so frail that he needed his son to bathe him , “ it ’ s like burned in my brain , ” he said .
 “ I wa enamored by that culture and night life , and the sex of it and the drug of it and doing it all , ” Mr. Eagan continued . “ But his story and what happened to him is very much a part of my identity a a gay man in New York , too. ” He stopped himself . “ I don ’ t know why I ’ m even talking about that , or what it mean . ”
 Isn ’ t it about fear being paired with joy ? And maybe with fully living ?
 “ Yes , ” he said , instantly . “ And the fear can be exhilarating , too . ”
 Half a moment later , in a perfectly smooth hairpin turn , he connected that emotional combination to his work at Ars Nova , where what he want is to “ create this place where people can step into the darkness with exhilaration and joy and fear all at once , and try anything and everything . ”
 “ But I ’ m also trying to create the safest place to do that , ” he said . “ So people can go a far a they want to go , and try everything they want to try , but be , like , swaddled ” — and here he mimed rocking an infant in his arm — “ a they develop their artistic voice . ”
 “ And then , ” he added , a if he were a person who ha no trouble with goodbye , “ they go out into the big , bad , show-business world . ”

 The best-selling author of “ Girl , Wash Your Face ” already ha million of follower , but she ’ s not done spreading the word .
 By Allie Jones
 DRIPPING SPRINGS , Tex . — Before 8 a.m. each day , Rachel Hollis , the motivational speaker and best-selling author of “ Girl , Wash Your Face , ” work out , feed her four child ( age 2 , 6 , 10 and 12 ) and writes in her gratitude journal . Then , it ’ s time for her “ morning show , ” a live broadcast on Instagram and Facebook for her nearly three million follower , sometimes featuring her husband , Dave .
 The day only pick up speed from there . Ms. Hollis , 36 , maintains a popular lifestyle website and run a medium company , which she recently moved from Los Angeles to the Greater Austin area . On any given morning , she may be taping one of her two podcasts , jetting off to a speaking engagement or headlining one of her own personal growth conference . ( Tickets are already sold out for this summer ’ s tour stop in Minneapolis and Dallas . )
 “ It ’ s preaching , ” Ms. Hollis said recently . “ In the church I grew up in , or honestly in any church I ’ ve gone to , the pastor always is using story from their real life to illustrate a point to you . So that is what I do . ”
 The daughter of a Pentecostal preacher , Ms. Hollis ha attracted her own kind of evangelical following . Her popularity exploded last year with the publication of “ Girl , Wash Your Face , ” a self-help manifesto that interrogates the “ lie ” that Ms. Hollis ( and , by extension , the Everywoman ) tell herself . Each chapter title focus on a different self-deprecating put-down , including , “ I ’ m Not Good Enough , ” “ I Am Defined by My Weight , ” “ I ’ m Not a Good Mom ” and “ I ’ m Bad at Sex. ” Several high-profile Christian pastor have endorsed the book , a have Drew Barrymore and Reese Witherspoon .
 Ms. Hollis ’ s advice is not cutting edge . She encourages her follower to do thing they probably already know they should do — wake up early , work out and make time for their goal . But her book ’ s marriage of rah-rah affirmation , confessional girl talk and folksy exclamation ( “ Keep me near the cross , Lord Jesus ! ” ) ha endeared her to million of woman across the country . “ Girl , Wash Your Face ” ha held a spot on the New York Times best-seller list for the last 46 week , and ha prompted much of the excitement around her speaking engagement . ( When she visited Fargo , N.D. , in January , a sold-out crowd of nearly 4,000 woman bested the previous record turnout for a chamber of commerce-hosted event , set when Shaquille O ’ Neal spoke there in 2017 . )
 Riding on the resonance of her first advice book , Ms. Hollis published a second , “ Girl , Stop Apologizing , ” this month . Like “ Girl , Wash Your Face , ” the book contains relatable confession and feature a smiling Ms. Hollis running her finger through her easy , beachy wave on the cover . This time around , she lay out a direct path to achieving personal goal , with section on excuse to abandon ( “ I don ’ t have time ” ) , behavior to adopt ( “ ask for help ! ” ) and skill to acquire ( “ LeadHerShip ” ) . It begin with a meditation on the Demi Lovato song “ Sorry Not Sorry ” and end with a peppy and direct , if not entirely novel , imperative : “ Believe in Yourself ! ”
 “ I ’ m telling you something that happened with me , ” Ms. Hollis said recently on a drive to her new , nearly 3,000-square-foot headquarters outside Austin , located , fittingly enough , in a former Baptist church . “ I ’ m telling you about my own loss or my own trauma or something that I did that helped , and then trying to use that to give you some guideline . ”
 And her delivery ? Watch one of Ms. Hollis ’ s YouTube video , or her documentary , “ Made for More , ” which she filmed during one of her conference last year , and you ’ ll see her dancing , jumping up and down , and sometimes yelling at the audience . She attribute some of this to growing up in a Christian parish with a “ dramatic and impactful ” style .
 She enjoys attending personal development conference and ha clearly been influenced by other motivational speaker , too . She and Mr. Hollis , a former president of worldwide distribution at Walt Disney Studios who left his position last year to help run Ms. Hollis ’ s now-multimillion-dollar company , paid thousand of dollar to attend Tony Robbins ’ s business conference last year .
 Outside influence can also be found in her book . Ms. Hollis often refers to tip she learned from others and can be somewhat relaxed about crediting her source . In both book , she relay information she saw on Oprah or “ read somewhere . ”
 Not every message ha been accepted with open arm .
 While writing “ Girl , Wash Your Face , ” Ms. Hollis said she got pushback from her publisher , the HarperCollins Christian imprint Thomas Nelson , for including a chapter about accepting the L.G.B.T . community . “ I ’ m a Christian , but I ’ m the most liberal Christian ever , ” she said . “ I want to love everybody . I actually think that ’ s what Jesus would do. ” For “ Girl , Stop Apologizing , ” Ms. Hollis chose to work with a business-focused imprint , HarperCollins Leadership .
 Ms. Hollis ’ s more conservative Christian follower were upset when she interviewed the former Vice President Joe Biden on his book tour . Some also react badly to , say , Instagram post that feature alcohol . ( “ It wa crazy , people were just like , ‘ You say that you ’ re a Christian , and you ’ re drinking wine . You ’ re spreading a bad message , and you ’ re telling people to be drunk , ’ ” she said . )
 Last November , BuzzFeed ran a story about “ Girl , Wash Your Face ” that criticized her central message : that you are responsible for your own happiness . In her book , Ms. Hollis mostly ignores the structural disadvantage woman , especially woman of color , face when trying to gain financial success . Instead , she encourages reader to make their goal happen no matter what .
 “ One of the thing the book ha been attacked for is , ‘ You say that anyone can kind of pull themselves up by the bootstrap and go . That ’ s just not true for everyone , ’ and I disagree , ” Ms. Hollis told me . “ I just , to the marrow of my bone , I disagree because there are too many people living in opposition of that belief . I moved to L.A. , left a crappy childhood , got three job and worked really freaking hard . And I ’ m not saying everybody ha the same opportunity . I ’ m not saying everybody ha the same resource . Of course , they don ’ t . But you , meaning the public , buying into the idea that it can ’ t happen for you because of what your life look like right now , doesn ’ t serve you . It doesn ’ t serve you ! ”
 “ That ’ s the hill I ’ ll die on , ” she said .
 Ms. Hollis is her own best advertisement . With just a high school education , she moved from Weedpatch , Calif. , to Los Angeles to study acting and pursue her dream of breaking into the entertainment business . At 19 , she landed a job a an assistant at Miramax ( in the hope of meeting Matt Damon , she said ) .
 She met Mr. Hollis while working at the company , and in 2004 they got married . That same year , she started her own event-planning business . She wa always hustling : In the span of three year , she self-published three novel ( one of them based on her experience a a young , Christian event planner to the star ) and started the lifestyle blog that she still run today .
 Now , the success of “ Girl , Wash Your Face ” ha made encouragement her full-time job . Ms. Hollis currently ha 22 employee who will barely fit in the new church turned office . She and Mr. Hollis are already looking for more space outside Austin .
 “ Our tagline ha been the same since I wa a blogger : ‘ Give people the tool to change their life , ’ ” she said . “ The irony is , back in the day , what I meant by that wa , ‘ teach them how to make a lasagna. ’ Because to me that wa life changing ! If I could get my kid to eat food that didn ’ t come from a box , I wa so proud of myself . Now , it look like personal development , because that ’ s what I ’ m really into . ”
 Ms. Hollis ha become more open with reader about her own advantage , perhaps taking some of those earlier criticism to heart . In that same BuzzFeed article , the author noted that Ms. Hollis did not address child care ( and it enormous cost ) in “ Girl , Wash Your Face ” outside of the acknowledgment section , where she thanked her nanny . In “ Girl , Stop Apologizing , ” Ms. Hollis included an entire chapter on asking for help , where she discussed employing a nanny , an assistant and a full-time housekeeper .
 At the new office , Ms. Hollis gave a tour of the space , pointing out her glass-walled office and space for a podcast studio . She said she briefly considered making the old parsonage out front a Hollis-themed store . For now , she plan to make use of the outside of the building . “ I want to put some kind of mural here , ” she said of one of the wall facing the street , “ so that fan could come and have an Instagram moment . ”
 On the morning I visited their home , the Hollises regaled their Instagram viewer with a tale of their son ’ s ailing beta fish and broke out into a joking , warbling rendition of the ’ 90 worship song “ Cast Your Cares . ”
 They sat in front of a wall of color-coded book including Michelle Obama ’ s “ Becoming ” and Tony Robbins ’ s “ Money : Master the Game. ” ( Ms. Hollis often refers to herself a “ Tony Robbins for women. ” ) Wearing a cozy black knit sweater and her signature beachy wave , Ms. Hollis sipped a green smoothie , while Mr. Hollis , in a blue button-down and black-rimmed glass , drank coffee from a Yeti mug printed with the word “ mogul. ” ( She ha the same word tattooed on her wrist . ) Thousands of her follower tuned in to watch the chatty back-and-forth . Think Chip and Joanna Gaines of “ Fixer Upper ” fame — except instead of fixing house , they are trying to fix people .
 After the broadcast wa over , Ms. Hollis explained the genesis of the new book . “ I got tired of woman being like , ‘ Oh , I ’ m sorry . I ’ m sorry . Excuse me . I ’ m sorry. ’ You know , that thing ? ” she said . With “ Girl , Stop Apologizing , ” she aim to address the guilt that woman “ carry for wanting something more in their life . ”
 “ This book is about shame , because I just saw it everywhere I went , ” Ms. Hollis said . The woman she encountered on her book tour and at her conference would say thing like , “ ‘ How do I do it ? ’ ‘ My husband doesn ’ t like me working. ’ ‘ My mother-in-law think I should do this. ’ ” She paused . “ Man , we got ta be able to claim our own piece of earth here ! ”
 She said she us the chatty morning show and her aesthetically pleasing Instagram post to draw her follower in . “ You can change woman ’ s life , but first you have to have their attention , ” Ms. Hollis said .
 “ My audience , they are not people who would ever describe themselves a into personal development , at all , ” she said . “ They are mom . They ’ re people who maybe started following on Instagram or Facebook , and never really thought about this stuff . So I think it ’ s important to make sure they ’ re still getting what they came for , but , hey , let ’ s also have this conversation about postpartum depression . Let ’ s have this conversation about you standing up for yourself in your relationship . ”
 “ My intention is I 'm going to get you here with the humor , or I 'm going to get you here with the lighthearted , ” Ms. Hollis said . “ Then I just want to add just a little something for you to think about during the day . ”

 Brands are giving lucrative endorsement deal to young child on YouTube and Instagram , raising question about whether their young follower should be seeing that kind of marketing .
 By Sapna Maheshwari
 Samia wa an influencer before she could talk .
 Her parent , Adam and LaToya Ali , are influencers themselves and began chronicling Samia ’ s impending arrival on YouTube and Instagram in 2014 , once Ms. Ali learned she wa pregnant .
 “ Samia ’ s birth video is on YouTube , so she ’ s pretty much been born into social medium , ” Mr. Ali said .
 Samia is now 4 and ha 143,000 follower on Instagram and 203,000 subscriber on YouTube . Her feed are mostly populated with post of her posing and playing , but they also feature paid promotion for brand like Crayola and HomeStyle Harvest chicken nugget .
 There are instance when “ Samia can ’ t verbatim get the message out , ” Mr. Ali , who life in the Atlanta area , said of the promotional post . “ Sometimes , their talking point are not kid talk , so LaToya would need to appear , or myself , to relay those because those are key deliverable that the brand want . ”
 Welcome to the world of kidfluencers . Brands have flocked to influencers — individual , famous or not , with large following on social medium — for year , hoping their online popularity will prompt their fan to buy the product they vouch for . Then child influencers started appearing on their parent ’ profile , a surreal but seemingly harmless offshoot of this phenomenon .
 Now , advertiser like Walmart , Staples and Mattel are bankrolling lucrative endorsement deal for toddler and tweens with large following and their own verified profile on YouTube and Instagram . As a result , child too young to make their own account on the platform are being turned into tastemakers .
 Instagram , owned by Facebook , and YouTube , which is part of Google , are designed for adult in large part because of a federal privacy law that protects child under 13 . Bios for many of the younger influencers on Instagram note that the page are “ run by parent , ” and YouTube channel are presumably registered to their guardian .
 Because they say their platform are 13-and-older zone , technology company do not have to comply with federal rule that limit targeted advertising and data collection . But Josh Golin , executive director of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood , said the company had no incentive to keep child off the site .
 And a TV rating continue to fall and child spend more time online , advertiser are spending more money to reach them there .
 “ The fact that brand are using actual child a influencers is a very clear sign that they ’ re targeting child that they know are on these platform , ” Mr. Golin said .
 That can mean big money for the family of kidfluencers . Kyler Fisher , the father of 2-year-old identical twin who have more than two million follower on Instagram , said a sponsored post on the girl ’ account could fetch between $ 10,000 and $ 20,000 .
 The twin , Taytum and Oakley , have promoted car seat and Carnival Cruise Lines on Instagram . They are also central to the success of their parent ’ YouTube channel , Kyler & Mad , which ha about three million subscriber . Promotions on the family YouTube channel can draw $ 25,000 to $ 50,000 .
 Fans are so interested in the family that their third child , due the first week of March , already ha 112,000 Instagram follower .
 “ My kid complete the package , man , ” Mr. Fisher said . “ If we didn ’ t have the girl , I can ’ t imagine being a far a we are . ”
 Another parent shared the price commanded by the parent ’ s child on the condition of anonymity , citing concern that the disclosure could harm negotiation with brand . The parent said brand might pay $ 10,000 to $ 15,000 for a promotional Instagram post while a sponsored YouTube video might earn $ 45,000 . A 30- to 90-second shout-out in a longer video can cost advertiser between $ 15,000 and $ 25,000 .
 Brands are also pursuing child with smaller following . The toy company Melissa & Doug emailed parent about a six-week influencer campaign last summer , offering payment and free toy for weekly Instagram post of their child “ having fun with the toy ! ” The company said it would pay $ 10 per 1,000 follower for individual Instagram post and $ 5 per 1,000 follower for Instagram Story post .
 The rise of this kind of advertising ha raised question involving fair compensation , oversight and work permit , especially since child labor guideline vary by state .
 Andrea Faville , a YouTube spokeswoman , said that the site didn ’ t allow anyone under 13 to make or own account and that it worked “ closely with expert , nonprofit organization and others in our industry to protect family using our service . ”
 YouTube came under fire last month after lewd comment by pedophile were discovered on innocent video of child ; the company ha since said it will suspend comment on most video of minor . Some channel that can “ demonstrate a low risk of predatory behavior ” will keep comment but require moderator , the company said . It remains to be seen if disabling comment will hurt the kind of connection kidfluencers try to establish with their fan .
 Sravanthi Dev , a spokeswoman for Instagram , said that while the platform prohibited user 12 and under , their parent or representative could create profile for them “ a long a it is clear in the bio information that the account is run by the parent or representative . ”
 Michelle Foley ’ s 6-year-old daughter , Ava , and her best friend , Everleigh , also 6 , have more than a million follower on their shared Instagram and YouTube account . YouTube ’ s analytics say Ava and Everleigh ’ s viewer are largely between the age of 25 and 44 , Ms. Foley said , but she said she thought the core audience wa between 8 and 18 .
 “ When we go out , parent never know who we are , but kid do , ” Ms. Foley said .
 Alex Chavez-Munoz , a founder of Viral Talent , which work with child influencers , also disputed the data .
 “ When you see the analytics of a kidfluencer channel , the dominant audience is 25- to 34-year-old woman , ” Mr. Chavez-Munoz said . “ That ’ s obviously not the case . The case is that the child is watching it on their parent ’ device . ”
 In December , a 9-year-old kidfluencer known a Txunamy shared a photo on Instagram and asked her more than two million follower to comment on it and share their age . Thousands of reply flooded in : 9 , 10 , 11 year old .
 Captiv8 , which connects brand with influencers , found more than 3,100 Instagram influencers , from a sample of 1.2 million account , who are likely under 13 based on term in their bios like “ managed by mom. ” ( Instagram ha more than a billion user . ) Each account had at least 1,000 follower .
 On YouTube , the much bigger kid influencer destination , there are toy account like Ryan ToysReview , whose young star earned $ 22 million in a year , according to Forbes . But child , under their parent ’ watch , are also building following on YouTube and Instagram a gamers , video blogger , fashionistas , mischievous toddler and personality who anchor family channel , which are often a cross between reality TV , prank and random skit . YouTube account can also bring in serious ad dollar without brand deal , which are shared with the site .
 Everleigh ’ s grandmother , whom Ms. Foley met when they worked together , came up with the idea of making an Instagram account for the girl when they were 10 month old , calling them “ besties ” and dressing them in matching outfit . The girl went “ viral ” eight month later after the account helped them land a modeling campaign for the Kardashian Kids line , Ms. Foley said .
 At that point , “ we were like , ‘ We should start a YouTube , ’ but they couldn ’ t talk , ” she said . “ So then we kind of waited for them to start talking . ”
 The girl also have their own separate Instagram account . Everleigh ’ s sponsored post have included promotion for toy ( “ I ’ m excited to share that the new PAW Patrol Mighty Pups line is available exclusively at Walmart ! ” ) and Disney doll ( “ Everleigh is in LOVE with her Fancy Nancy doll ! ” ) .
 The girl have made celebrity out of the rest of their family . Ava ’ s 1-year-old brother ha 148,000 Instagram follower , and Everleigh ’ s newborn sister ha a million . Recently , Everleigh started a YouTube channel , Everleigh Opens Toys , and Ava is interested in making one , too , Ms. Foley said .
 “ If it wasn ’ t for Everleigh and Ava , I would not have what I have today , ” she said .
 Brands want to team up with child for the same reason they want to work with older social medium personality — their follower count , the ability to post more quickly than traditional ad agency , the way the post feel like recommendation from a friend . But advocate say these technique can deceive child , who are in the early stage of understanding and recognizing advertisement .
 Children ’ s television , overseen by the Federal Communications Commission , ha rule that separate ad from content and limit product placement and promotion by a program ’ s host or character . The internet doesn ’ t .
 YouTube ha it own guideline for child ’ s advertising , but they are often hard to police . For example , the YouTube Kids app , designed for child 12 and under , is not supposed to contain sponsored content , but The New York Times found several paid advertorial video from influencers there for company like Walmart , Dreamworks and Claire ’ s . ( YouTube removed the video after The Times asked about them . )
 “ It is very manipulative of young child , ” said Kathryn Montgomery , a professor emerita at American University ’ s School of Communications . “ With this form of promotion and advertising , there is a purposeful blurring of those line . ”
 Ava and Everleigh ’ s YouTube channel pepper sponsored video among dance battle and hangout with other influencers . Ms. Foley said the family could get 10 email request a day from brand .
 The girl posted a 10-minute sponsored video for Mattel in November titled “ First Sleepover Opening Giant Presents ! ” An adult asked the child , clad in matching pajama , about their holiday wish list , which wa “ Barbie everything ! ” They appeared to sleep , then woke up , squealing , to wrapped Barbie merchandise .
 Mattel declined to comment on it child influencer strategy .
 In an advertorial video for Staples , Txunamy declared her excitement about back-to-school shopping at the chain , then showcased her “ haul . ”
 “ Whenever we work with younger influencers , all contract and negotiation are conducted through their parent or talent agency directly representing them , ” said Meghan McCarrick , a spokeswoman for Staples .
 Social medium star aren ’ t typically considered actor under the law . In California , a portion of child actor ’ earnings are set aside in a trust based on the decades-old Coogan Law , named for a former child star whose parent spent all his money by the time he turned 21 . Similar trust are required by New York , Louisiana and New Mexico . For kidfluencers , it 's usually a voluntary decision by parent to create these account .
 Several family said they had established the account after working on traditional TV show or national commercial .
 As for the child , it can be tough for them to understand how much of a fuss they ’ re creating .
 Samia ’ s father , Mr. Ali , said , “ She doesn ’ t have a concept of viral or ‘ view , ’ so it ’ s almost like , for her , walking into an experiment to learn something — it ’ s more of u giving her a task or assignment , where she ha something to conquer . ”
 He added , “ We ’ ll know when she get a sense of her following and let her know what this all mean . ”
 Because of an editing error , an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated who had said brand might pay $ 10,000 to $ 15,000 for a child 's promotional Instagram post and $ 45,000 to sponsor a YouTube video . It wa another parent , not LaToya and Adam Ali .

 LOS ANGELES — Netflix finally cracked the Academy Awards .
 After year of aggressive maneuvering , the streaming service received it first-ever nomination for best picture on Tuesday , with Oscar voter naming “ Roma ” a one of the best movie of 2018 . The meditative black-and-white film about life in Mexico in the 1970s — which officially ha North American ticket sale of zero , since Netflix doe not release it film in a traditional manner — amassed 10 nomination over all , including for Alfonso Cuarón ’ s direction , cinematography and original screenplay .
 [ “ If Beale Street Could Talk ” received three nomination . Here ’ s what ’ s on the director Barry Jenkins ’ s mind . ]
 Yalitza Aparicio , who play the lead role in “ Roma , ” received a best actress nomination , a rare recognition for an Indigenous woman that also give the film a high-profile presence in the acting race , a crucial part of collecting the vote needed for a best picture win . Voters even found a spot for Marina de Tavira a supporting actress .
 The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences allows the best picture category to have a many a 10 or a few a five nominee , depending on how the organization ’ s 8,200 voting member spread their support . This time around , eight movie were nominated , down from nine from last year . Rounding out the category were idiosyncratic indie ( “ The Favourite , ” “ Vice ” ) , studio crowd-pleasers ( “ Black Panther , ” “ A Star Is Born , ” “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” ) and film about racism in America ( “ BlacKkKlansman , ” “ Green Book ” ) .
 Compared with year past , when academy voter came under repeated # OscarsSoWhite attack for failing to nominate film that focused on black character , the best picture selection were remarkably diverse . Besides the foreign-language “ Roma , ” there wa “ Black Panther , ” which celebrates black culture . Gay right group have praised “ The Favourite ” for it depiction of a lesbian love triangle . “ A Star Is Born ” is about a woman on the rise .
 “ I can ’ t remember a time when best picture had such diversity across the board , ” said David Linde , the chief executive of Participant Media , which helped produce “ Roma ” and “ Green Book. ” Participant , which focus on social cause , wa also a force behind “ RBG , ” about Ruth Bader Ginsburg , the Supreme Court justice , which received a nomination for best documentary . “ We make these movie for a reason — they lead to conversation that are important — and it ’ s great to see the academy membership taking them so seriously , ” Mr. Linde added .
 [ See the complete list of Oscar nominee . ]
 Even so , the acting category were le inclusive , with one black actor and one black actress among the 20 nominee . “ Crazy Rich Asians ” wa overlooked completely . All of the directing , cinematography , editing and original score nominee were men . “ We must do better , ” the actress Amber Tamblyn wrote on Twitter .
 “ The Favourite , ” the latest from the Oscar superpower Fox Searchlight , tied with “ Roma ” for the most nomination . A dark-hearted period comedy , “ The Favourite ” saw Olivia Colman get a best actress nod ; Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone each receive a supporting actress nomination ; Yorgos Lanthimos honored for his direction ; and Sandy Powell competing in costume design . ( Powell , a 14-time nominee and three-time winner , wa also nominated for her “ Mary Poppins Returns ” costume . )
 Speaking by phone from a London editing room , Lanthimos said he wa pleased that voter recognized all three actress at the center of “ The Favourite . ”
 “ That ha been my whole goal from the beginning — three very strong woman , without one separated out , ” he said . “ The fact that most of my collaborator got recognized is what I ’ m most proud about. ” For someone whose film had just been thrust to the front of the Oscar race , Lanthimos sounded strangely composed . “ I ’ m calm because I ’ m working , ” he said . “ You have to stay focused . I ’ ll celebrate tonight . ”
 Unlike last year , when the list of nomination revealed “ The Shape of Water ” a the clear Oscar front-runner , the current race is still very much a race .
 Don ’ t count out Spike Lee ’ s “ BlacKkKlansman , ” the true story of a black police officer who infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan in the 1970s . For the first time in his 40-year career , Lee received a nomination for best director , joining Cuarón , Lanthimos , Adam McKay ( “ Vice ” ) and Pawel Pawlikowski ( “ Cold War ” ) . “ BlacKkKlansman ” got six nomination in total , including for Adam Driver ’ s acting in a supporting role and Terence Blanchard ’ s score .
 “ A Star Is Born ” received eight nomination — fewer than expected , with Bradley Cooper failing to get a widely predicted director nomination . Cooper wa recognized for his lead acting , however . Lady Gaga received nod for her lead acting and songwriting . Oscar voter also honored the Warner Bros. remake in category like supporting actor ( Sam Elliott ) and sound mixing . “ Vice , ” a comedic biopic about Dick Cheney , also had eight nomination .
 “ Black Panther ” received seven , making it strongest mark in music : song , score , sound editing and sound mixing . Hannah Beachler , honored for her “ Black Panther ” production design , became the first African-American to break into that category .
 The best actress contest is unusually competitive . Glenn Close received her seventh Oscar nomination — she ha never won — for playing the title role in “ The Wife , ” a Sony Pictures Classics film about a woman who sacrifice her professional ambition . Close , who won a Globe for the performance , will be vying against the first-time nominee Aparicio , Gaga and Colman , also a Globe winner . Melissa McCarthy ( “ Can You Ever Forgive Me ? ” ) drew the fifth slot .
 Among the actor , Cooper will compete against Christian Bale , who transformed himself into a paunchy Cheney in “ Vice , ” and Rami Malek , who morphed into a toothy Freddie Mercury in “ Bohemian Rhapsody. ” Also nominated were Willem Dafoe ( “ At Eternity ’ s Gate ” ) and Viggo Mortensen ( “ Green Book ” ) .
 “ Green Book , ” adored by many for it feel-good depiction of interracial friendship and disliked by others for it reliance on racial clichés , garnered five nomination , including editing and original screenplay . Although “ Green Book ” did not receive a much attention a expected — Peter Farrelly wa snubbed a a director nominee — voter seemed generally unfazed by the ongoing brouhaha around the film , including the resurfacing of an anti-Muslim tweet by Nick Vallelonga , one of the film ’ s screenwriter . ( He apologized . ) “ Green Book ” also won the predictive top prize at the Producers Guild of America award over the weekend .
 [ “ A Star Is Born ” fall short of expectation , and Netflix make history . Read about this year ’ s snub and surprise . ]
 Perhaps fittingly in such a scattershot year , the ceremony itself is shaping up a a mystery . No host ha been named ; the academy ’ s first choice , Kevin Hart , dropped out after ( initially ) refusing to apologize for past anti-gay ramblings on Twitter . It is also unclear how the 91st Academy Awards , scheduled for Feb. 24 , will handle a major change in it format : To keep the show to three hour , up to eight category will be moved to commercial break , with the winning moment edited and aired later in the telecast . The academy ha not said which category ( there are 24 total ) will be jettisoned from the live show .
 The academy ’ s leader — with urging from ABC , which broadcast the ceremony — decided to take such drastic action because viewership ha been plummeting . A record low of 26.5 million people watched last year ’ s telecast , a nearly 20 percent drop from a year earlier . As recently a four year ago , the Academy Awards had an audience of nearly 44 million viewer .
 Another effort to attract more viewer , the creation of an Oscar for “ outstanding achievement in popular film , ” wa abandoned by the academy in September . The academy wa trying to make room for blockbuster , which voter have increasingly tended to ignore in favor of little-seen art film . But this year ended up a an exception : “ Black Panther , ” with $ 1.35 billion in global ticket sale , wa the No . 1 movie of 2018 . It is the first superhero movie nominated for best picture . “ A Star Is Born ” collected $ 409 million , an astounding total for a drama .
 In some way , Oscar voter appeared to be saying that Hollywood ha room for both the future ( Netflix , which also secured three nod for “ The Ballad of Buster Scruggs ” ) and the past ( classic studio story like “ A Star Is Born , ” which is the fourth version of that film to receive nomination ) .
 The academy ’ s old guard had resisted an aggressive push by Netflix to join the best picture club , arguing that , since the streaming service doe not release it film in a traditional theatrical manner , it offering should be better considered by Emmy voter . “ Roma ” ha played in a smattering of theater in North America , but major chain have refused to show it because Netflix made it available online in short order . AMC and Regal said on Tuesday that they would not include “ Roma ” in their annual showcase of best picture nominee .
 Netflix ha relentlessly campaigned for Oscars , though , making inroad first with documentary and then , last year , with “ Mudbound , ” which missed a best picture nomination but received attention in other prominent category .
 The embrace of “ Roma , ” which is classified a a foreign-language film , may reflect effort to make the academy more international and diverse . After the # OscarsSoWhite backlash in 2015 and 2016 , the academy mounted an effort to double female and minority membership , in part by inviting in more foreign film professional . But even after three year of the initiative , the academy remains 69 percent male and 84 percent white .
 “ Roma , ” filmed in Spanish and Mixtec , is the first foreign-language movie to receive a best picture nomination since “ Amour ” in 2013 . ( No foreign film ha ever won . “ The Artist , ” named best picture in 2012 , wa a French film . But it wa silent and hence not deemed a foreign film by the academy . ) Joining “ Roma ” in the foreign film race were “ Cold War ” ( Poland ) , “ Capernaum ” ( Lebanon ) , “ Never Look Away ” ( Germany ) and “ Shoplifters ” ( Japan ) .
 Among company , Fox and it affiliate scored the largest number of nomination , with 21 . Universal and Disney each had 17 .
 [ Many of the nominated movie are already available to stream at home . Browse our list . ]
 An earlier version of this article misstated the year in which a record low of 26.5 million people watched the Oscars telecast . It wa in 2018 , not this year . An earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to where “ The Artist ” wa made . Although it wa a French film , and production took place in France , it wa filmed in the United States .

 Maggie Haberman , Michael Schmidt , Mark Mazzetti and more of our journalist explained what the submission of the full report mean and what may come next .
 By The New York Times
 The special counsel , Robert S. Mueller III , and his team have finished their long-anticipated report after investigating possible Russian interference in the 2016 election and obstruction of justice by President Trump and his associate .
 [ Read about the special counsel ’ s full report that wa delivered to the attorney general on Friday . ]
 We asked reader what they wanted to know about the report and what may come next . We received more than 600 question , and our journalist in Washington responded to a selection .
 It all depends on Attorney General William Barr . He is now reading the report to see whether Mr. Mueller alleges that President Trump broke the law and to determine how much of the investigator ’ finding should be made public .
 Mr. Barr told Congress earlier this year that he want to release a much a he can . On Friday , he told Congress he could provide lawmaker with an update on Mr. Mueller ’ s finding a soon a this weekend . But he could be limited in what he can tell Congress , a the special counsel ’ s report may contain classified information and evidence obtained by a grand jury .
 — Michael S. Schmidt
 Mr. Barr ha broad discretion , but it is not absolute . He may not lawfully be able to share information that is subject to grand jury secrecy rule absent a court ’ s permission , for example . He is also likely to acquiesce to any decision by President Trump to assert executive privilege to withhold certain material , like communication with the president or agency deliberation .
 During his confirmation hearing , Mr. Barr said he intended to be a transparent a possible , consistent with the Justice Department ’ s practice and policy . That could mean withholding information about open investigation or about people Mr. Mueller decided not to charge with a crime . There is also a wild card : Mr. Barr ha long adhered to a sweeping view of executive power under which the president , a head of the executive branch , ha a constitutional right to control the exercise of discretionary policymaking by a subordinate such a himself .
 — Charlie Savage
 Mr. Barr could decline to release any information that is classified or subject to grand jury rule . He could also keep any information from the public that is relevant to ongoing investigation . There could also be a looming battle over any information the White House claim is subject to “ executive privilege , ” which protects confidential discussion between the president and his adviser .
 — Mark Mazzetti
 The investigation by the special counsel ’ s office is over now that Mr. Mueller ha provided his final report to the attorney general . So his team is not expected to seek additional charge .
 Other federal prosecutor who received information related to Mr. Mueller ’ s investigation could move forward and seek indictment . For instance , federal prosecutor in New York continue to investigate possible crime that Mr. Mueller referred to them related to campaign finance violation that ensnared Michael D. Cohen , Mr. Trump ’ s former personal lawyer . Prosecutors are also investigating a top fund-raiser to Mr. Trump and a former lawyer in the Obama administration . Mr. Mueller had referred both case to other prosecutor .
 — Adam Goldman
 Nothing in the Constitution or federal statute say that sitting president are immune from prosecution , and no court ha ruled that they have any such shield . But the Justice Department ’ s Office of Legal Counsel — under the Nixon administration , and again under the Clinton administration — ha opined that “ structural principle ” in the Constitution implicitly bar indicting a president .
 Essentially , the idea is that the stigma of being indicted and the burden of a trial would unduly interfere with a president ’ s ability to oversee the executive branch and carry out his constitutional duty , so any indictment would have to wait until he is no longer president — either through impeachment and removal , or because his term is up . This interpretation of the Constitution is disputed , but it is nevertheless binding on Justice Department prosecutor , including Mr. Mueller .
 — Charlie Savage
 There have already been referral that Mr. Mueller ha made to federal prosecutor when he ha found evidence of a possible crime that he considered outside his purview . The prosecution of Mr. Cohen began a a referral by Mr. Mueller to prosecutor in the Southern District of New York .
 House Democrats are almost certain to seek the evidence that Mr. Mueller received during the course of his investigation . A number of House committee chairman are planning to ask executive branch agency to preserve document that they provided to the special counsel .
 — Maggie Haberman
 We don ’ t know what ’ s in the report . I don ’ t want to speculate on what the worst-case scenario might be . But we do know that the special counsel had been investigating whether the president obstructed justice when he fired James B. Comey , then the F.B.I . director , in May 2017 .
 Mr. Mueller had also been examining Mr. Trump ’ s tie to Russia and whether anybody associated with his campaign conspired with the Russians during the 2016 election . Mr. Mueller ’ s investigation led to charge against more than 30 people , but none of them tied the president to a Russian conspiracy .
 — Adam Goldman
 We really don ’ t know the answer , but Mr. Trump ’ s lawyer consider it one of their greatest accomplishment that he never sat for an interview .
 In early 2018 , Mr. Mueller threatened to subpoena the president , setting off month of negotiation between the special counsel ’ s office and Mr. Trump ’ s lawyer . Ultimately , in November , Mr. Trump answered several question in writing about what occurred during the campaign . But he refused to answer question about his time in office — including whether he tried to obstruct justice . This meant that Mr. Mueller ’ s prosecutor were only left with the statement of other witness when they sought to determine why Mr. Trump may have interfered with the investigation .
 Mr. Trump ’ s lawyer believed heading off an interview wa such a great success because if he had testified , he would have been at risk of making an inaccurate statement and increasing his criminal exposure .
 — Michael S. Schmidt
 Good question , we don ’ t know . Disney World ?
 We do know that some member of his team intend to return to their job at law firm in New York and Washington , and others to return to the Justice Department . It ha been reported that Andrew Weissmann , one of the senior member of the team , intends to teach at New York University .
 As for Mr. Mueller , maybe he ’ ll also go back to working at a law firm or retire . It ’ s certainly possible that one or more of the House committee investigating various aspect of the case and Mr. Trump will want to call him to testify , though Mr. Barr , the attorney general , will have a say in whether he can do so .
 — Mark Mazzetti
 In his letter to Congress on Friday , Mr. Barr said he “ may be in a position to advise you of the Special Counsel ’ s principal conclusion a soon a this weekend. ” But we don ’ t know what is in the underlying report .
 Here are some category of element that may raise legal or policy concern about disclosure to Congress or the public :
 1 . Any highly classified information , such a something that could help the Russian government identify and take out an intelligence source ;
 2 . Anything that remains relevant to an ongoing investigation , such a those that Mr. Mueller spun off to regular prosecutor or the ongoing counterintelligence investigation into Russia ;
 3 . Testimony and file that were presented to the grand jury and so are subject to a federal rule of criminal procedure that generally forbids disclosure of such material absent a court order ;
 4 . Negative information about people whom prosecutor scrutinized but decided not to charge with a crime , which the Justice Department normally doe not make public ( this is why Mr. Comey ’ s news conference about Hillary Clinton ’ s email server wa so broadly condemned by other law enforcement official ) ;
 5 . Internal executive branch information , like confidential communication with the president or agency deliberation , that could be subject to a claim of executive privilege .
 — Charlie Savage
 In short , yes . Congress can subpoena just about anything it want , but that doe not mean lawmaker will do so or that they will be successful in getting what they want .
 Democrats have made abundantly clear that they will be satisfied with nothing le than Mr. Mueller ’ s full report and access to his underlying evidence . They will start by asking for the Justice Department to share all that information voluntarily . If the department resists , a committee could issue a subpoena to try to compel it to produce the relevant document .
 What come next is likely complicated . There are several reason the Justice Department might be unwilling to just hand over classified or grand jury information , even under subpoena . In that case , Congress could sue to try to enforce it demand . Then it would be up to the court to decide who get to see what .
 — Nicholas Fandos
 The White House counsel ’ s office anticipates being able to review the report to raise possible objection related to executive privilege . We have no sense right now how long that will take , but any effort by the White House to bar the release of element of the report is sure to set off a political and legal battle .
 Mr. Barr said on Friday that he anticipates being able to brief Congress within a few day about the special counsel ’ s “ principal conclusions. ” But it is not clear how much of the report ’ s detail and underlying documentation he will ultimately provide to Congress and , by extension , the public .
 Mr. Barr appeared to be lowering expectation during his Senate confirmation hearing when he said he wanted to be a transparent a possible but might provide simply a summary to Congress .
 — Maggie Haberman
 We have no information that the full report will be made available to state or federal prosecutor . But during the course of his investigation , Mr. Mueller ha referred a number of case to other federal prosecutor in New York and Washington .
 — Adam Goldman
 We still don ’ t know what ’ s in the report . In term of electoral politics , you ’ re right — it might not fundamentally change the partisan divide over Mr. Trump . His supporter have shown a willingness to stay with him in the face of allegation and behavior that might have doomed a more traditional politician .
 But you could argue that this report ha an importance that go well beyond partisan politics , reflecting an investigation that yielded substantial result — not least in establishing the degree of Russian interference in the 2016 election . Don ’ t forget that half a dozen Trump aide have been indicted or convicted .
 Regardless of Mr. Mueller ’ s conclusion , Democrats in the House are pressing ahead on issue such a whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice after becoming president . The Democrats say Mr. Barr need to make a much of Mr. Mueller ’ s finding public a soon a possible because the American people deserve an accounting of what went on .
 — Michael S. Schmidt
 If anyone is to be indicted down the road , it won ’ t be by Mr. Mueller . It ’ s now clear that his team won ’ t try to charge anyone else , because his work is done .
 To be sure , there are now numerous , ongoing investigation by other federal prosecutor that could mean legal peril for Mr. Trump ’ s adviser or family member . Remember that in the investigation being run by prosecutor in the Southern District of New York , Mr. Cohen implicated the president in a scheme to pay off two woman before the 2016 election . But given Justice Department rule , there isn ’ t any expectation that Mr. Trump would be in legal jeopardy a long a he ’ s in the White House .
 — Mark Mazzetti
 As of Sept. 30 , 2018 , the special counsel ’ s investigation had cost more than $ 25 million .
 More than $ 12 million of that wa direct spending by Mr. Mueller ’ s team . That amount will increase once the special counsel ’ s office submits it final list of expense . Those cost included the expense of Justice Department personnel and other resource that supported the special counsel office .
 The special counsel say the Justice Department would have incurred those expense for the “ investigation irrespective of the existence of the ( special counsel office ) . ” The special counsel also seized more million in property and fine .
 — Adam Goldman
 We wish we knew . Keep in mind there are likely to be two report : one prepared by Mr. Mueller for the Justice Department and another prepared by Mr. Barr to be shared with Congress and the public .
 Both report could be a short a a few page , or considerably longer . And Mr. Barr could well choose to give the public a more concise report than Mr. Mueller gave him . That said , a senior Justice Department official told reporter on Friday that the report delivered by Mr. Mueller had been “ comprehensive . ”
 — Nicholas Fandos
 Correction : March 26 , 2019An earlier version of this article misstated Robert S. Mueller III ’ s work status before he became the special counsel . Mr. Mueller wa a partner at a law firm ; he wa not retired .

Samsung , whose operating profit plunged 29 percent amid a decline in demand for memory chip , also said earnings this year might struggle . PayPal disappointed analyst , too , even a it revenue rose .
 But Qualcomm beat Wall Street expectation and issued a forecast that assuaged some concern about a weak smartphone market in China . Other company also had good news .
 Microsoft , often considered an indicator of the broader market , said that it commercial and consumer business were doing well , with revenue and profit increasing more than 10 percent from a year earlier . Its continued shift to cloud computing ha placed it within striking distance of Amazon , which lead the field .
 Alibaba , China ’ s largest e-commerce business , said that it earnings growth sank last quarter and that it revenue , which rose 41 percent , had increased at it slowest pace since early 2016 .

 That turn run counter to Mr. Trump ’ s vision for the project , which he had cited a a milestone in reversing the decline in factory job . The twist also brought new friction in Wisconsin , where the initiative ha been politically fraught from the start because of it billion of dollar in tax subsidy .
 Foxconn said that it remained committed to creating 13,000 job , but economist questioned how such a large work force could be created if the plant ’ s focus wa on other area .
 A lack of clarity over the term of Britain ’ s looming departure from the European Union ha British business stockpiling product and delaying investment , writes the NYT ’ s Peter Goodman .
 The option : Parliament may yet approve Prime Minister Theresa May ’ s unpopular exit deal — she survived a critical vote on Tuesday that could have derailed it — especially if the alternative is a tumultuous no-deal departure .
 The reaction : Companies must plan for outcome both wildly unknown and potentially damaging . They are making backup plan while having no idea how it will end .
 The cost : By one estimate , the British economy is already 2.3 percent smaller than it would have been if voter had backed E.U . membership in a 2016 referendum . The main culprit is uncertainty . Investment in the auto industry plunged last year . The cost of separation is apparent in finance , housing and other area , too . Food retailer have warned of delay and shortage .
 More European news : Two engine of the eurozone economy , France and Germany , are cooling , a trend that threatens to deepen the pain across the Continent . Italy fell into a recession in the last quarter of 2018 after it economy shrank by 0.2 percent .

 Yesterday ’ s testimony by Michael Cohen , President Trump ’ s former personal lawyer , before the House Oversight Committee wa full of theatrics . But between allegation of presidential lawbreaking and racism were revelation about how the Trump Organization operated . They weren ’ t flattering .
 Mr. Trump inflated his net worth to apply for bank loan , according to Mr. Cohen . When he asked Deutsche Bank for financing to buy the Buffalo Bills , he claimed to have $ 4 billion in unquantified “ brand value. ” He also exaggerated the value of property , according to financial statement that Mr. Cohen gave to the House .
 Democratic lawmaker pushed Mr. Cohen to talk about other kind of fraud . Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , for instance , asked him whether Mr. Trump inflated the value of asset when insuring them . “ Yes , ” he replied .
 The testimony may have hurt Mr. Trump ’ s inner circle . Potential victim : Donald Trump Jr. and Allen Weisselberg , the Trump Organization ’ s C.F.O. , both of whom were said to have played a role in hush-money payment to the porn star Stormy Daniels ; Ivanka Trump , who wa involved in plan to build a tower in Moscow ; and Jay Sekulow , a White House lawyer whom Mr. Cohen accused of altering testimony to Congress .
 Mr. Cohen hinted that more could be revealed . He told lawmaker that he couldn ’ t answer question about his last conversation with the president because it wa “ being investigated right now ” by federal prosecutor .
 Mr. Trump ’ s woe certainly aren ’ t over . Five House committee are investigating his business dealing , and federal prosecutor in New York are still looking at matter that involved Mr. Cohen .
 Robert Lighthizer , the president ’ s top trade adviser , warned lawmaker yesterday that hurdle remained to reaching a significant trade deal with China , Ana Swanson of the NYT report :
 Plans to raise tariff on Chinese good are officially axed . Mr. Lighthizer , testifying before the House Ways and Means Committee , confirmed that the U.S. wouldn ’ t raise levy on $ 200 billion in Chinese import after March 1 .
 Mr. Lighthizer still plan to play hardball . He “ told lawmaker that he and his negotiator are maintaining a tough line with the Chinese , ” Ms. Swanson writes , “ repeatedly using the word ‘ if ’ when talking about the potential for reaching a deal with Beijing . ”
 And he insists that President Trump isn ’ t losing patience . “ His instruction to me are : You have to get a great agreement . If we have no agreement , we ’ ll just wait until we can get a great agreement , ” Mr. Lighthizer said .
 But success isn ’ t guaranteed . “ Is this perfect ? I ’ m not going to say it ’ s perfect , ” Mr. Lighthizer said of the evolving deal . “ But at least it ’ s leading to result where everything else didn ’ t . ”
 More : The U.S. trade deficit in good widened by 10 percent in December , despite the administration ’ s attempt to shrink it .
 The main topic at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona , Spain , this week ha been the long-hyped next generation of wireless network , known a 5G , Adam Satariano of the NYT writes .
 The F.C.C. ’ s chairman say America is winning the race . “ In my view we ’ re in the lead with respect to 5G , ” the chairman , Ajit Pai , told the WSJ . He belief the agency is making progress in selling the necessary wireless spectrum and overhauling infrastructure .
 Not everyone agrees . Brent Skorup , who sits on the F.C.C. ’ s Broadband Deployment Advisory Committee , writes in a WSJ op-ed that “ the U.S. ha stumbled , ” but “ still ha time to catch and pas China , the current leader — if the right policy are put in place on both the local and federal level . ”
 “ A widely available , reliable 5G network will require hundred of thousand of new transmitter site , and on that score the U.S. trail badly , ” Mr. Skorup writes . Private industry will need to collaborate with the federal government , he caution , adding that “ with a combination of responsible use of public asset and light-touch regulation of 5G service , we can still win this race . ”
 More : Here are all the 5G handset announced so far .
 Today wa supposed to bring a denuclearization deal between America and North Korea . Instead , official abruptly cut short a summit meeting between President Trump and North Korea ’ s leader , Kim Jong-un . “ Sometimes you have to walk , ” Mr. Trump said at a news conference today .
 Blame sanction . Mr. Trump told reporter that North Korea wanted all of the punishing economic sanction against the country lifted , but America wouldn ’ t cooperate unless Mr. Kim agreed to give up all of his nuclear weapon .
 The announcement wa a surprise , in part because Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim appeared to be getting along well . At one point , Mr. Trump called his counterpart “ my friend . ”
 The collapse of the talk wa “ a diplomatic failure after he had hoped his second summit with Kim , following their meeting last summer in Singapore , would produce demonstrable progress toward North Korea ’ s denuclearization , ” the WaPo report . Mr. Trump insisted that the two country could resume talk in the future .
 A week ago , the British prime minister wa on the brink of resignation by cabinet official and a crushing defeat in Parliament over her Brexit plan . Now , she ha won another two week to tweak her agreement and convince lawmaker to back it .
 Mrs. May won a set of vote last night that had previously threatened to undermine her control of the Brexit process . The victory followed a partial surrender : She agreed on Tuesday to give Parliament the option of seeking to delay Britain ’ s exit from the E.U .
 “ Theresa May is closer to leading Britain out of the European Union with a Brexit deal than at any other point since her negotiation with Brussels began , ” Therese Raphael of Bloomberg Opinion writes . Hard-line Euroskeptic M.P.s like Jacob Rees-Mogg have softened their opposition to Mrs. May ’ s plan , fearing that the alternative might be remaining in the E.U .
 But her offer of a potential delay could fall apart . President Emmanuel Macron said France might veto such a move “ without a clear understanding of the aim that ’ s being pursued . ”
 More : Britain ’ s opposition Labour Party formally backed a new referendum on Brexit . Britain won approval to remain in a key World Trade Organization agreement . And Norway ’ s $ 1 trillion wealth fund said it would continue to invest in Britain , on the basis that it 30-year time horizon wasn ’ t affected by political issue like Brexit .
 News story about Americans outraged by smaller tax refund are everywhere . But Neil Irwin of the Upshot say the furor isn ’ t rooted in logic .
 • “ The tax law that President Trump signed at the end of 2017 reduced the average American household ’ s 2018 average federal income tax obligation by about $ 1,600 , according to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center . ”
 • But it meant that many worker prepaid le tax . The average tax refund filed through mid-February wa down 17 percent from the same time last year , according to the I.R.S .
 • A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow , Mr. Irwin note — which mean a lower initial bill is worth more than a bigger refund .
 • Economists remain baffled by the phenomenon of people even wanting refund . “ Why do they want to make interest-free loan to the government ? ” asks Richard Thaler , the Nobel-winning economist .
 Car ownership is falling out of fashion — under pressure from rising price , tightening environmental rule , ride-hailing competition and the promise of a self-driving future . In it latest cover story , Bloomberg Businessweek argues that trend could continue :
 • “ A decade ago the auto industry predicted annual global vehicle sale would top 100 million by now , but they ’ ve stalled instead , falling to 94.2 million last year , down 1 million from 2017 . ”
 • “ Major urban center such a London , Madrid , and Mexico City are restricting car ’ access . Such constraint , plus the expansion of the sharing economy and the advent of the autonomous age , have made automaker nervous . ”
 • “ ‘ When you put all these trend together , you ’ re going to see a cap on personal vehicle ownership start to emerge , ’ say Mike Ramsey , an automotive consultant with researcher Gartner Inc. ‘ We are near peak car . ’ ”
 • “ Rather than signaling the end of the road for the automobile , peak car is a reflection that reurbanization and the widespread adoption of mobile apps that can summon a vehicle on demand will lessen the need for many of the 1.3 billion vehicle now on the road . ”
 • “ Automakers may talk a good game about moving metal , but increasingly they ’ re chasing profit expected to come from service that charge by the mile . ”
 A new World Bank report examined 35 indicator of legal equality in 187 country to understand how easy it is for woman to work and earn money .
 It rate only six country a giving woman full legal equality : Belgium , Denmark , France , Latvia , Luxembourg and Sweden . By it measure , none did so a decade ago .
 America isn ’ t even in it top 60 country for legal environment that help promote gender parity in the workplace .
 That ’ s a problem . “ Economies that failed to implement reform toward gender equality over the past 10 year , for example , saw a smaller increase in the percentage of woman working overall and in the percentage of woman working relative to men , ” Kristalina Georgieva , the World Bank Group ’ s interim president , writes .
 “ If woman have equal opportunity to reach their full potential , the world would not only be fairer , it would be more prosperous a well , ” she said in a statement . “ Change is happening , but not fast enough . ”

 In a sea of late-90s rom-com take on classic literature , “ 10 Things I Hate About You ” stood out for remaining faithful to it Shakespearean root . Based on “ The Taming of the Shrew , ” the film centered on the Stratford girl , whose strict father won ’ t allow Bianca ( Larisa Oleynik ) to date until her older sister , Kat ( Julia Stiles ) , doe . The problem : Kat ha no use for boy ; she ’ s got her sight set on college . Hoping to go out with Bianca , new student Cameron James ( Joseph Gordon-Levitt ) hatch a convoluted plan to get Patrick Verona ( Heath Ledger ) to date the prickly Kat . Of course , drama , romance and a lot of awkward moment ensue .
 What stand out 20 year later is the movie ’ s continued relevance — it Seattle teenager debate sexual politics — a well a it status a a beloved teen comedy . Made for $ 11.2 million , “ 10 Things I Hate About You ” wa released on March 31 , 1999 , and made instant star out of Stiles , Gordon-Levitt and Ledger .
 But thing could have turned out differently because several actor you know could have ended up a the lead .
 I recently spoke with the star ( including Gabrielle Union and David Krumholtz ) , the director Gil Junger and others about casting near-misses , face-drawing and their memory of Ledger , who died of an accidental prescription-drug overdose in 2008 . Here are edited excerpt from the conversation .
 Kirsten Smith and Karen McCullah wrote the script at a time when teen rom-coms based on the classic were trending in Hollywood .
 KIRSTEN SMITH There wa such a big teen movie explosion at the time . We were young writer who had never sold a script before , and it wa very unusual you would get your first script made , let alone greenlit six month after it wa optioned . It had this feeling all around of first .
 JULIA STILES I remember thinking [ the screenplay ] wa so cool and I just loved the heart of Kat so much . I wa dying to get the role . I had been reading “ The Taming of the Shrew ” in school , and it wa the first time I had read a romantic comedy [ script ] that captured teenage angst in such a clever way .
 LARISA OLEYNIK I remember being pretty smitten with it right away . The script wa unabashedly feminist and really of the riot grrrl era of the Pacific Northwest .
 Katie Holmes and Kate Hudson were among several performer up for leading role . Even some of the final cast member originally wanted different part .
 MARCIA ROSS ( casting director ) We screen-tested Josh Hartnett , Eliza Dushku , Heath and Julia . But Julia and Heath just had the best chemistry together . I loved Katie Holmes . She wa about to get “ Dawson ’ s Creek , ” and we had to make a decision really fast . The other person I loved wa Kate Hudson . But her mom [ Goldie Hawn ] didn ’ t like the script for her , so she passed .
 JOSEPH GORDON-LEVITT If I ’ m really honest , I didn ’ t want to do a high school romantic comedy . I wanted to do Sundance movie . I ’ m very lucky that five year later , I got to do that . The truth is , I wa a naïve or stuck-up 17-year-old .
 OLEYNIK I auditioned for both Kat and Bianca pretty much up until the very end , and I really wanted Kat . I think I wa so obsessed with wanting to prove to them that that ’ s who I wa , that by the time I ’ d get to the Bianca stuff , I ’ d be like , “ Oh , yeah , sure , whatever. ” And I ’ m sure that ’ s why it worked , because I wa super-relaxed about it .
 DAVID KRUMHOLTZ ( who played Michael , Cameron ’ s neurotic best friend ) I wanted to play Cameron , but I had worked with Gil on a couple of TV project , and he knew I could do Michael in my sleep , in the sense that you play a neurotic Jewish kid . I know that Joe wanted to play Michael .
 GORDON-LEVITT I auditioned both for Krumholtz ’ s part and my part , because I thought [ Krumholtz ’ s part ] wa funny . Then [ Gil ] wanted me to play Cameron .
 GABRIELLE UNION ( Chastity , Bianca ’ s pal ) I wa over 10 year older than my younger cast member , some of whom were still in high school . So , it wa kind of like , how close is this to my high school year ? Do I look crazy playing a 15-year-old ? Don ’ t mention Earth Wind & Fire or give away your age .
 Heath Ledger thought he bombed his audition , but his star power wa undeniable to everyone .
 SMITH [ On ] his audition tape , he wore a white suit with a black button-down shirt . He wa really dressed up , very John Travolta “ Saturday Night Fever. ” It wa a look that wa rumpled and rock , but way more dressed up than anyone else wa , which wa badass because he could pull that off .
 GIL JUNGER Heath walked in , and I thought to myself , if this guy can read , I ’ m going to cast him . There wa an energy to him , a sexuality that wa palpable . When Heath wa done , literally , with the first page , I said , “ O.K. , you can put down the script . You ’ re doing great . I want to do a little improv with you. ” I just wanted to see how fast his mind would adapt , comedically . After 35 second , I said , “ O.K . Fantastic. ” But I could tell he wa nervous that he blew it , because the audition wa so quick , and I said , “ No , no . you ’ re a very talented guy , and I really appreciate you coming in. ” The instant the door closed , I turned to the woman in the room and said , “ Ladies , I have never wanted to sleep with a man , but if I had to sleep with a man , that would be the man . Please cast him immediately . ”
 Ledger took creative control of the scene in which he woos Kat by singing “ Can ’ t Take My Eyes Off You ” from the bleacher at her soccer practice .
 McCULLAH The first song we had in the script wa “ I Think I Love You. ” Then we decided on “ I Touch Myself , ” and I think Heath decided that that wasn ’ t romantic enough , so he chose the Frankie Valli song , which wa a much better call .
 JUNGER I said to Heath , “ Just run around the step when the guard start to chase you. ” Right after the first take , the nurse on set ran up to one of the guard . They were fearful he might have pushed himself almost to a heart attack . Heath wa running with such joy that it physically exhausted the guard .
 Kat ’ s drunk table-dancing in a party scene would have career ramification for Stiles .
 STILES I hadn ’ t ever really been drunk before in real life . I mean , I wa 17 , so I remember Heath — because he wa older — giving me tip on what being drunk look and feel like .
 JUNGER I wa good friend with Paula Abdul , and I mentioned to Julia that I wa going to have a big choreographer work with her and Julia said , “ That ’ s fine , but I can dance. ” I went against my normal instinct and trusted her .
 STILES I would never have the gut to do that now . I ’ m glad somebody got that on film . I mean I love dancing , but sort of provocatively on the table ? I wa pretty guileless at that point . I also have heard that that is what got me the part in “ Save the Last Dance. ” The director said to me that he had seen that scene , then realized that I could do hip-hop , not just ballet .
 Andrew Keegan , who played the wealthy bully , needed help for a scene involving an obscene drawing .
 MCCULLAH That scene came from a friend of mine from college . He passed out and his roommate drew a [ penis ] on his face , and then he got up and walked across the street to a 7-Eleven without knowing .
 ANDREW KEEGAN Quite frankly , I did not know how to draw [ a penis ] on someone ’ s face , and I believe David wa the one that helped creatively with that .
 KRUMHOLTZ I had to teach Andrew . I sat him down and we rehearsed . In a way , I kind of conducted my own penis-drawing on my face .
 KEEGAN I have heard about that scene for my whole adult life , so I think I did a pretty good job .
 During the most heartfelt scene in the movie , in which Kat read the titular poem to Patrick , Stiles went off-script and cried .
 STILES It had been such an emotional role and such a wonderful experience that I wa overjoyed , and probably sad it wa coming to an end , but I also wa just in a very raw place .
 JUNGER Basically , the whole speech wa one shot .
 STILES I remember Heath , when they turned around to do his reaction shot , he said something like , “ I don ’ t need to do anything because this isn ’ t about me. ” A lot of time you get one actor cry in a scene and the other actor feel like they have to cry , and he knew to be sort of restrained . I thought that wa really cool .
 JUNGER I did everything I could to cover my mouth and nose because I wa cry so hard . It wa such an amazing performance . That take [ in the film ] is the first take . I think I jumped up and just hugged her for the longest time .
 In the final scene , Letters to Cleo performs on the rooftop of Padua High School , but the crew didn ’ t have permission to shoot there .
 JUNGER Disney said they loved the work I wa doing but couldn ’ t justify spending that much money for one shot . And then when the line producer said to me , “ What did they say ? ” I don ’ t know what the hell it wa , but some instinct in me said , “ They said yes . Shoot it . ”
 ANDREW LAZAR ( producer ) It wa so complicated , and we had a helicopter .
 JUNGER I wa flying in the helicopter , and I said to the pilot , “ Charge ’ em. ” And he flew right over [ Letters to Cleo ] .
 KAY HANLEY ( Letters to Cleo lead singer ) We ’ re all arranged on top of this postage-stamp-sized roof with chicken wire the only thing protecting u from toppling to our death into the Puget Sound . The music start playing [ and ] we start pretending we ’ re in a music video . We hear the whir of a chopper right above u , and then it dive-bombs u . We did two take , and it wa pretty much assumed that this shot wasn ’ t going to work , and Gil would never work in Hollywood again because he had just blown through half a million dollar doing this shot he wa forbidden to do . And it ended up being a pretty iconic scene .
 JUNGER Kay wa [ exhilarated ] . She said , “ Do you have any idea how scared I wa ? ”
 The cast recall the shoot a one of the best time of their life , but they wish Ledger wa here to celebrate the anniversary .
 OLEYNIK It ’ s projecting a fantasy of a high school experience , but it ’ s also grounded in what most 17-year-olds are still feeling , what I ’ m still feeling a a 37-year-old .
 GORDON-LEVITT I feel like the sheer closeness that we all had that summer is a big part of why people like that movie , because it wasn ’ t fake . I spent all summer laughing at [ Krumholtz ] and slowly starting to talk like him . By the end of that summer , everybody talked like an old Jewish man from Queens because of Krumholtz .
 KRUMHOLTZ You know , people still say , “ I have a [ penis ] on my face , don ’ t I ? ” And I have to be like hey , you got me . It ’ s haunted me for the rest of my life . It ’ s wonderful .
 STILES It wa a really fun summer . There wasn ’ t a mean person in the bunch . I remember [ Heath ] played the didgeridoo , which wa the first time I had even been introduced to that .
 KRUMHOLTZ It always make me swallow hard when I know that something I say about Heath is going to be put out there . My clique wa Heath and his lovely assistant and best friend , Trevor [ DiCarlo ] . I loved Heath . As I get older , and a the movie take on greater relevance with new audience , it ’ s harder to wrap my head around the idea that Heath passed on the way he did . I would ’ ve very much loved him to be part of this article , to feel appreciated for his work in the film , because he worked really hard on “ 10 Things I Hate About You . ”
 UNION Heath had the ability to look at you , and [ make ] you feel like Princess Diana . In a very crowded Hollywood landscape , he could make you feel special and seen . That ’ s a pretty special gift , and I don ’ t think it ’ s talked about enough .
 KRUMHOLTZ Toward the end of his life I reunited with him , at a time when we were both quite vulnerable and trying to recover from some stuff that wa haunting u . I had an opportunity to tell Heath how much I loved him and to sort of try to help Heath . He had become so famous , and his life had become so crazy , that in the moment when I could ’ ve said something , I didn ’ t , even though I thought it . It ’ s a big regret I have . To fan , he ’ s a movie star that died . To me , he wa flesh and bone , soulful , sweet , and I know for a fact he wa in recovery prior to his death . He wa trying to get healthy .
 I just want people to know there wa a suffering individual there , who couldn ’ t have been a lovelier human being . I prefer to remember Heath a a 20-year-old kid doing his first American lead with a big giant Cheshire grin smile on his face , taking charge a the leader of the group like any good ensemble leader should .
 An earlier version of this article misstated the cost of making “ 10 Things I Hate About You. ” It wa $ 11.2 million , not $ 16 million .
 An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misspelled the name of one of the actor . It is Andrew Keegan , not Andrew Keegen .

 But a mere utensil is not enough to hold Jennifer Lopez ’ s attention for long . Soon , J-Lo swing back around to return her focus to A-Rod . Their engagement is on deck , after all .
 When I meet up with Mr. DeVito for an interview the next night at the Palm , he explains that he wa not trying to come between J-Rod .
 “ No , she had her eye glued to him , ” Mr. DeVito say , laughing . “ But I think everybody did . It wa kind of cool. ” He say he ’ s friendly with J-Lo because his company , Jersey Films , produced her best movie , “ Out of Sight , ” also starring George Clooney .
 Sipping cranberry juice with club soda and eating Chilean sea bass , Mr. DeVito is a far more civilized dining companion than his character in “ It ’ s Always Sunny in Philadelphia , ” Frank Reynolds , who would no doubt order the most expensive bottle of wine , guzzle the whole thing , wave around a gun , wax nostalgic about the time he waterboarded his daughter in a urinal and then skip out on the check with a doggie bag of bacon bit for lovemaking later with a girlfriend who like to role play that she ’ s a Cobb salad .
 “ She ’ s really rough , ” Mr. DeVito crow to me about his TV girlfriend , bragging that they have sex in a dumpster . “ I like a little bit of that . ”
 Frank is in a pantheon of delicious vulgarian played by Mr. DeVito , character who compress the seven deadly sin into one compact package , yet somehow still charm .
 A native of Asbury Park , N.J. , Mr. DeVito became a TV star in 1978 a Louie De Palma , the lewd , loud taxi dispatcher , for five season in “ Taxi ” and this year will begin filming his 13th season a the lewd , loud Frank in “ It ’ s Always Sunny . ”
 “ Tinseltown ’ s Tiny Terror , ” a Time once nicknamed him ( he ha called himself “ the five-feet guy ” ) , ha also had an extraordinarily long , successful career a a producer , director and actor in indie and big-budget film , most recently a Max Medici in Tim Burton ’ s “ Dumbo , ” a reimagining of the 1941 Disney classic , which open next week .
 “ Danny ’ s just got a good Felliniesque spirit about him that make you want to be around him , ” say Mr. Burton , who ha directed the “ DeVito trilogy ’ ’ of the actor a top-hatted ringmaster in “ Batman Returns , ” “ Big Fish ” and now “ Dumbo. ” ( Mr. Burton say that the film , featuring a very woke circus and an adorable C.G.I . blue-eyed baby elephant , won ’ t upset those who swore off circus because of elephant abuse , noting , “ As a child , I felt very uneasy about the circus for that reason . ” )
 [ RELATED : Maureen Dowd play a game with Danny DeVito . ]
 Michael Keaton , who ha a dastardly turn in “ Dumbo ” a an archcapitalist , say he marveled that when Mr. DeVito played Oswald Cobblepot , better known a the Penguin , in the 1992 film “ Batman Returns , ” he created an entire garden outside his trailer , with beautiful hedge , potted plant , a chair and a table for water , where he presided , doing “ his Danny thing , his Jersey funny , irreverent thing . ”
 Robert De Niro , who met Mr. DeVito in an equity picket line in the rain at a theater in the Village when they were in their mid-20s , admired his fellow Italian so much that he called to ask him for tip before he directed “ A Bronx Tale . ”
 Basically , Mr. De Niro tell me , Mr. DeVito ’ s advice boiled down to : “ Don ’ t worry . ”
 It is a measure of Mr. DeVito ’ s magnetic presence that , despite his diminutive stature , he ha said he wa never bullied a a child . The first time he emerges from the dispatcher ’ s cage in “ Taxi , ” the audience erupts into shocked laughter , because his height is such a contrast with his character ’ s outsize confidence and belligerence .
 Mr. DeVito say his older sister , Angie and Theresa , filled him with self-esteem . Angie brought him into her salon and taught him to do hair . He wa affectionately nicknamed “ Mr . Dan . ”
 “ They loved me , yeah , ” he say . “ They treated me like a little prince . ”
 A former altar boy , he is described by friend a a Tasmanian devil . “ He ha no fear , ” say Michael Douglas , an old friend and former roommate . “ He will comedically take any chance , and he savor darkness . ”
 Mr. DeVito ha been nude on film twice , once in “ Big Fish , ” when his ringmaster turn from a werewolf back into a man , and once on “ Always Sunny , ” when he bust out of a leather couch he ’ s hiding in looking like a greased-up halibut .
 “ I ’ m no Willem Dafoe , ” he say blithely , but “ I ’ m not shy about taking my clothes off . ”
 I tell him about a young guy in Boston who is such a big fan that he bought a 1996 Chevy Lumina van and named it Vanny DeVito . He tattooed it on his leg and printed out bumper sticker of Mr. DeVito ’ s face to hand out on a cross-country trip .
 He ’ s unfazed . “ Oh , yeah , ” he say . “ I know about these thing . They ’ re all over the place . There wa a girl last year who took me to her prom with the cardboard cutout of me . I wa her date . I love all that stuff .
 “ You know , I did a movie called ‘ The Van ’ one time . It wa like a low-budget people-in-a-van movie . ”
 When a sophomore at SUNY Purchase constructed a DeVito altar made from trash in a men ’ s room last year , Mr. DeVito tweeted , “ Your shrine honor me . My heart is filled with love and garbage . ”
 He wa a pioneering meme lord with his # trollfoot , picture of his right foot out and about : from moment of repose , drinking wine on the beach , to painted in rainbow color to match his feather boa on a float at the Los Angeles pride parade last year .
 “ My first tweet wa : ‘ My nut are on fire , ’ ” he recall . “ And then what am I going to do ? So I started taking picture of my foot and sticking it online . ”
 Mr. DeVito ha been in many great movie : “ L.A . Confidential , ” “ Tin Men , ” “ Get Shorty , ” “ Twins , ” “ Ruthless People , ” “ Man on the Moon , ” “ Romancing the Stone , ” “ Terms of Endearment , ” “ One Flew Over the Cuckoo ’ s Nest , ” “ Matilda ” and “ War of the Roses , ” which he also directed . And he ha produced several , including “ Gattaca ” and “ Erin Brockovich . ”
 He bought a script sight unseen from a fledgling filmmaker in the 1990s because he had liked the young man ’ s first movie script and wanted to do whatever wa next . “ A year later — and it wa a long year — he finally showed up with 155 page , ” Mr. DeVito recall . “ It said , ‘ “ Pulp Fiction ” by Quentin Tarantino : Final Draft. ’ So I sat down in a comfortable chair and I read it . And I wa blown away by it . I thought it wa hysterical . ”
 I tell him that “ Dumbo ” is well timed for a Trump era , when the circus , clown and elephant-in-the-room metaphor are flying fast and thick . Mr. DeVito himself ha referred to both the president and Democrats a “ clowns. ” ( Except for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , whom he hail a “ a gift . ” )
 Mr. DeVito , who like to listen to “ Democracy Now ” and is reading “ Democracy in Chains : The Deep History of the Radical Right ’ s Stealth Plan for America , ” say he will campaign for Bernie Sanders , a he did in 2016 , and that he ’ d like to see him run with Tulsi Gabbard .
 “ If you look back on that election , a lot of his progressive idea are accepted now , ” he say . “ Like free college education . Yale ’ s not going to be free , we know that , right ? ” Indeed we do , thanks to Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin . “ I didn ’ t go to any college . Forgive the debt , so people can live their life and not feel they ’ re under a wet blanket . Let ’ s let the sun shine . We have a beautiful country . We got a lot of resource . You know , Medicare for all . What ’ s the big deal ? Why not open that up ?
 “ We got to take a big breath and move on and get out of this muck and mire . I don ’ t wish anybody ill , but I think it would be a good thing to get a lot of people out of our government . Let them go fishing or someplace south , stick them on a farm somewhere , and get our country moving . The one that are there now are really stinking up the joint . ”
 Many liberal in the Twittersphere regard Mr. DeVito ’ s succinct 2013 tweet a certified platinum : “ Antonin Scalia retire bitch. ” Even more gratifying than when he went on “ The View ” in 2006 , after a long night of downing Limoncello with Mr. Clooney , and blurted out that George W. Bush wa a “ numb nut ” and that he and his wife , Rhea Perlman , had enjoyed a wild night in the Lincoln Bedroom when Bill Clinton wa president .
 He ha occasionally leavened his loathsome but lovable little men by playing a romantic lead . But Mr. DeVito relish villain . Not gangster , but crazy con men and ne ’ er-do-wells in black comedy .
 I wonder if kid ever get scared if they see him on the street and realize he ’ s the really mean dad from “ Matilda . ”
 “ No , it ’ s cool , ” he say . “ The mother usually say , ‘ He ’ s O.K . He ’ s not going to hurt you . ’ ”
 He say playing the Penguin wa the biggest kick , even though a monkey went wild on the set , “ leapt at my ball and grabbed me . It wa the scariest thing . They had to rip him off . ”
 Other than that , he recall , “ It wa a lot of fun . You got to put all the clothes on and the suit and the mask . It ’ s like real commedia dell ’ arte . We all hide behind mask anyway . And you add something else onto that , which is like a beak , flipper , and you live in the sewer and you drool black crap out of your mouth . ”
 He is very relieved that the monkey in “ Dumbo ” is C.G.I .
 At 74 , Mr. DeVito ha separated from Ms. Perlman , his wife of 37 year , and split his time between a house in Los Angeles and an apartment in New York .
 “ I get to see everybody , ” he say . “ I see Rhea . I see the kid . I just live apart . ”
 He said he hasn ’ t checked out Tinder , adding dryly : “ I rely on the kindness of stranger . ”
 He seems carefree . Asked about the Net-azon streampocalypse underway in Hollywood , where many people were privately breathing a sigh of relief that Netflix ’ s “ Roma ” did not win the Oscar for best movie , Mr. DeVito shrug . He caught only some of the Academy Awards on TV because he wa busy barbecuing .
 “ I ’ m just looking for a good story , ” he say . “ And a good book . And a good screenplay . Work with people that you like . Go to dinner . Go on vacation . Have a good time . Yeah , no stress . Vote for Bernie Sanders . ”
 He wa equally nonchalant about the racial politics roiling the town in the wake of “ Green Book ” beating “ BlacKkKlansman ” for best picture , which caused Spike Lee to try to storm out of the auditorium .
 “ I have nothing to say about ‘ Green Book ’ and ‘ BlacKkKlansman , ’ ” he say . “ But I do know that we are a bunch of racist . ”
 I ask Mr. DeVito , father to two daughter and a son , if Hollywood ha changed in the wake of # MeToo .
 “ The only thing I can say is I ’ ve talked to woman about this and what I come away with is four word : ‘ Women must be heard. ’ That ’ s my mantra . Is that five word ? No , four word . It ’ s like I say to my agent every day , the magic four word : ‘ Get me a job. ’ Come on ! ”
 Are studio mogul just waiting to resume their bad old way when the umbrage abates ?
 “ Well , we ’ re all suffragette , ” he say . “ We got to get woman equal pay . We got to get ’ em on the map . We got to respect ’ em . We got to keep our hand off ’ em unless they beg for it . ”
 Mr. DeVito produced and acted in “ Man on the Moon ” with Jim Carrey , about the late comedian Andy Kaufman , who played Latka Gravas on “ Taxi. ” He recall the day when Kaufman used to belittle and then wrestle with woman delivering U.P.S . package to the “ Taxi ” set .
 “ He ’ d say , ‘ Why are you taking a job away from a man ? You should be in the kitchen cooking ! You know how many men need a job ? You ’ re taking a job ! Go on , what are you going to do , honey ? ’ And they would wrestle him .
 “ I actually thought , in hindsight , that Andy wa having u on . Now that I know everything about him , it ’ s not out of the question that Andy got a woman , got her a costume , gave her a big package with nothing in it , and had her act like a U.P.S . person . ”
 He say the best way to thrive in Hollywood is to not focus on all the jerk and talentless hack and insecurity .
 “ It ’ s like going through the jungle , ” he say . “ You hear all the sound . Somebody ’ s being eaten on the other side of a plant . But you got to just stay on your path . ”
 Before we go , Mr. DeVito take a stab at teaching me how to hang a spoon on my nose . “ Clean it off first , ” he instructs . “ You have to breathe on it , something about the condensation . ”
 I tell him that I ’ ll probably see him out on the road with Bernie Sanders .
 “ He ’ ll be the tall one , ” Mr. DeVito say , and jauntily wave goodbye .

 In his 82-minute address last night , President Trump cited U.S. economic growth and his effort to keep it up , while attacking opponent in a speech that ostensibly called for unity in Washington . Here are the highlight for the business world :
 Mr. Trump defended his economic record . He took credit for America ’ s robust economic health — a key message for his 2020 re-election campaign — and assailed critique of his administration ’ s effort , including tax cut and loosened regulation . “ An economic miracle is taking place in the United States — and the only thing that can stop it are foolish war , politics or ridiculous partisan investigation , ” he said .
 He kept pressure on China . Mr. Trump promoted his administration ’ s trade battle with Beijing , saying , “ We are now making it clear to China that after year of targeting our industry , and stealing our intellectual property , the theft of American job and wealth ha come to an end. ” Talks between Washington and Beijing over a compromise are continuing .
 And he painted his potential rival a socialist . As Democratic presidential contender promote policy like Medicare for all , Mr. Trump tried to paint them a peddler of dangerous idea . “ Here in the United States , we are alarmed by new call to adopt socialism in our country , ” he said .
 What didn ’ t he talk about ? “ Trump ’ s speech wa notable for what he did not mention , including the ballooning federal debt , once a centerpiece of the Republican agenda ; nor did he talk about Social Security , Medicare or other entitlement , ” Philip Rucker and Toluse Olorunnipa of the WaPo write .
 Democrats fought back . Stacey Abrams , the party ’ s nominee for Georgia ’ s governorship last year , focused on “ outlining the party ’ s vision for lower health care cost and a more inclusive immigration policy , and pressing her case that access to the voting booth should be easier , not harder . ”
 Steep cut could hit Goldman Sachs ’ s commodity arm , which once generated huge profit for the firm , Liz Hoffman of the WSJ report , citing unnamed source .
 What may happen : “ Executives are discussing pulling back from trading iron ore , platinum and other metal , and are ordering cost cut to the sprawling logistics network that handle the transport and storage of physical commodity , ” Ms. Hoffman writes .
 The context : The business wa once one of Wall Street ’ s most envied money maker . But such trading ha suffered in recent year , thanks to changing market and tighter regulation . And Goldman ’ s current C.E.O. , David Solomon , cut his teeth a an investment banker and is focused on operation like lending and asset management .
 The symbolism : “ By taking a knife to the business , Mr. Solomon is sending a message down the rank that nothing is sacred , ” Ms. Hoffman writes .
 In recent week , several company — including Ford , G.E. , JPMorgan Chase and Wynn Resorts — have missed Wall Street forecast , only to see their stock price rise . It ’ s a classic relief rally , writes Matt Phillips of the NYT :
 • “ Stocks of company that have reported their result have risen by an average of 1.1 percent , the largest post-earnings jump in a decade . ”
 • “ With the Federal Reserve backing off plan to aggressively hike interest rate , more investor view the market ’ s downturn last year a overdone . And they are giving rousing ovation to corporate result just because they ’ re not a bad a they could have been . ”
 • “ Analysts said that the current tendency in the market to see the glass a half-full reflects widespread relief among investor that a recession and a sharp slump in earnings are not in the card any time soon . ”
 • “ Some analyst said that stock could keep climbing a the market ’ s rock-bottom expectation keep getting surpassed . ”
 • “ At the same time , there is a danger that the stock market ’ s rise could paper over the genuine problem for the economy that are popping up in fourth-quarter result . ”
 When the Chinese electronics manufacturer Foxconn decided to set up shop in the Midwest , President Trump hailed the move a “ one of the great deal ever. ” But Bloomberg Businessweek , which interviewed 49 people familiar with the project , report how badly the effort ha gone .
 The plan wa to create a high-tech manufacturing hub . It wa to be led by a Mount Pleasant plant housing a large chunk of Foxconn ’ s LCD TV production . “ As Foxconn ha discovered , there is no better place to build , hire , and grow than right here in the U.S. , ” Mr. Trump said at the time , promising that it would create a many a 13,000 job .
 But manufacturing hasn ’ t taken off . “ LCD component weren ’ t made in the U.S.A. , according to source familiar with the operation , ” Austin Carr of Businessweek writes . “ They were shipped from a Foxconn factory in Tijuana . The Wisconsin plant wa only handling the last step of assembly. ” He add that “ during 2018 , the company tried and failed to produce it own LCD material at scale in Wisconsin so it wouldn ’ t have to import them from Mexico . ”
 Nor ha pay or recruitment . “ Pay at the factory started at about $ 14 an hour with no benefit , much le than the $ 23 average Foxconn promised . Many people weren ’ t hired full time , ” Mr. Carr writes . “ Last fall , the company ’ s hiring target began dropping internally , ” he add , with Foxconn importing foreign staff for some role .
 Keeping hold of the title of most valuable American company is proving to be difficult , Stephen Grocer of the NYT writes :
 • “ The position of Apple , Microsoft , and Amazon have been flip-flopping since the wipeout in the iPhone maker ’ s stock price late last year . ”
 • “ The mantle ha changed hand seven time among the three company . Three of those switch have taken place over the past week a the big tech company reported quarterly result . ”
 • “ The competition reflects the global economic concern hanging over the market a well a the changing technology landscape , and it ’ s a shift from past year . ”
 A bill introduced by Senators Chuck Schumer and Bernie Sanders to limit company ’ ability to buy back stock drew outrage from many in the corporate world — and tempted Goldman Sachs ’ s former C.E.O . Lloyd Blankfein to tweet for the first time in nearly seven month .
 Mr. Blankfein ’ s take : “ A company used to be encouraged to return money to shareholder when it couldn ’ t reinvest in itself for a good return , ” he tweeted . “ The money doesn ’ t vanish , it get reinvested in higher growth business that boost the economy and job . Is that bad ? ”
 Mr. Sanders ’ s retort : The senator shot back that a buyback , “ increase the wealth of billionaire ” like Mr. Blankfein . “ Instead of making the very rich even richer , how about increasing wage for American worker . Is that a bad idea ? ”
 More buyback news : SoftBank of Japan plan to spend $ 5.5 billion of proceeds from the listing of it telecommunication arm to repurchase stock .
 The Government Accountability Office ha published a report of the president ’ s travel expense , which show the cost of his visit to his Florida holiday home :
 • From Feb. 3 to March 5 in 2017 , Mr. Trump spent portion of 14 day at the holiday home . The G.A.O . said that those trip had cost a total of $ 13.6 million , or just le than $ 1 million per day .
 • The cost included travel and accommodation , Secret Service expense and bomb detection . Almost $ 60,000 wa paid directly to Mar-a-Lago .
 • The Democratic senator Dianne Feinstein and Gary Peters , who requested the report , said the finding provide “ a snapshot of the ten of million of dollar President Trump spends to travel to his Palm Beach resort — all at taxpayer expense — including government fund that are paid directly to a business in which the president himself ha a financial interest . ”
 Angela Ahrendts will step down a Apple ’ s retail chief in April after a five-year run . She ’ ll be succeeded by Deirdre O ’ Brien , the company ’ s head of human resource .
 SeaWorld Entertainment said it would hire Gus Antorcha , who wa most recently Carniva Cruise Line ’ s chief operating officer , a it new C.E.O .
 Goldman Sachs promoted Nick Giovanni to co-head of it global tech , medium and telecom investment banking team .

 While many house of worship are warding off developer a they struggle to hold on to their building , Trinity Church ha become a big-time developer itself .

 [ What you need to know to start the day : Get New York Today in your inbox . ]
 Since the blockbuster musical “ Hamilton , ” tourist have been swarming Trinity Church , part of an Episcopal parish in Lower Manhattan that date to the 17th century . Alexander Hamilton and his wife , Eliza Schuyler Hamilton , are buried in the cemetery there .
 Recent year have been good to the church and the rest of it campus . St. Paul ’ s Chapel , near the World Trade Center , escaped destruction during the terrorist attack of Sept. 11 , 2001 , and now gleam following a fresh coat of paint . After a cleaning in September , Hamilton ’ s white marble obelisk also sparkle . Soon the entire church — and a new $ 350 million glass tower under construction behind it — will , too .
 It make sense . If a founding father can get a 21st-century update , so can the church where he is buried . Especially since the church in question is very , very rich .
 While many place of worship are warding off developer a they struggle to hold on to their congregation and building , Trinity is a big-time developer itself .
 The church ha always been land-rich . And it ha long had it own real estate arm , which control ground lease and office space rental in the building it owns . But now it find itself with a newly diversified portfolio worth $ 6 billion , according to the current rector , the Rev . Dr. William Lupfer .
 After being instrumental in changing the zoning law in Hudson Square , a neighborhood between West Houston and Canal Streets , Trinity Real Estate ha entered into a joint venture that give it a majority stake in 12 building that contain six million square foot of commercial space . A lucrative deal with the Walt Disney Company , valued at $ 650 million , wa signed just last year .
 And a it build it glass tower — which will house administrative office , public gathering space and , yes , commercial tenant — Trinity is also renovating the interior of it historic church , which is expected to cost $ 110 million .
 Trinity ha been able to do all this because it ’ s been a savvy manager of it resource . It is also , a a church , exempt from tax .
 But some wonder about the ethic of a religious institution being such a power player in the world of New York real estate .
 “ What is the fundamental economic issue going on that church deserve tax exemption and can build up a lot of wealth ? ” asked Rachel M. McCleary , a lecturer in the economics department at Harvard University and co-author of the coming book “ The Wealth of Religions : The Political Economy of Believing and Belonging . ”
 Trinity ’ s current affluence can be traced to a gift of 215 acre from Queen Anne in 1705 . ( The church wa first chartered , under King William III , in 1697 , a few decade after the British took over New Amsterdam . ) Trinity still owns 14 acre of that original land grant , mostly in Hudson Square .
 At the time Trinity received the land , of course , there wa no separation of church and state . “ They were a favored religion , and that gave them a leg up , ” Dr. McCleary said . “ The question becomes , How are they to be viewed in a pluralistic religion market , and what is their response in that market today ? ”
 Patti Walsh , a spokeswoman for the church , wrote in an email that Trinity handle such a market by working closely with other organization to help them further their mission . “ We currently work with many partner in New York City and around the world to build neighborhood , to help develop clergy and lay leadership for the church , and to help our partner resource their ministry . ”
 The current Trinity is the third church to be built at Broadway and Wall Street . Designed in a Gothic Revival style by Richard Upjohn and completed in 1846 , the brownstone building wa the tallest structure in the city for decade , and one of the first to be declared a landmark .
 It ’ s “ a place where you can get away from the noise and experience the aesthetic beauty and quiet , ” said the Rev . Phillip A. Jackson , the vicar of the Episcopal parish of Trinity Church Wall Street .
 But now that the church is at the center of the development boom in Lower Manhattan , it ’ s le of an oasis of calm and more of a contributor to the very noise and disruption from which longtime resident have sought a reprieve .
 There is the new tower , which topped out late last year , and will have 17 floor of office space in addition to a nine-story base devoted to parish and community use .
 And a part of the church interior ’ s “ rejuvenation , ” a the parish leadership call it — the first extensive renovation in decade — the nave is closed and scaffolding reach to the 65-foot-high ceiling so that conservation expert can inspect stained-glass window and the integrity of the ceiling . There will be three new organ , ergonomically contoured seat for the old oak pew and stained-glass pendant light that will be controlled by an iPad . The church ’ s famous altarpiece , donated by the Astor family , will be restored and placed on rail so it can be moved back and forth depending on the type of service or event .
 The project , overseen by Murphy Burnham & Buttrick Architects , which restored St. Patrick ’ s Cathedral in Midtown , is a shining example of stewardship . The New York Landmarks Conservancy awarded Trinity a prestigious Chairman ’ s Awards last year .
 These project stand in stark contrast to other house of worship around the city , many with dwindling congregation , struggling to pay heating bill and keep the roof from leaking .
 Indeed , a section of falling ceiling wa one of the latest indignity suffered by the Metropolitan Community United Methodist Church , in East Harlem , built in the Gothic style in the 1870s . It is now slated for demolition after the pastor , the Rev . Dr. Richard N. Hayes , gave up on the structure following year of “ repair , repair , repair , ” he said .
 Dr. Hayes ha struck a deal to sell the church , which is not a landmark , to a developer — a plan that will provide money for a new church to be built on an adjacent lot . The likelihood that the developer will raze the historic building ha divided the congregation and prompted an outcry from neighbor and preservationist .
 “ For decade the preservation of church ha been a major issue , ” said Andrew Dolkart , a professor at the Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture , Planning and Preservation . No longer . “ It ’ s become a crisis , ” he said .
 Although attention in recent year ha focused on the shuttering of church by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York , the problem affect all denomination , said Peg Breen , president of the New York Landmarks Conservancy , which is surveying religious property in the five borough .
 Congregants have resorted to doing patchwork repair themselves ; pastor solicit donation in emergency . Recently , the front door blew off the Immanuel-First Spanish Church in the Boerum Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn . It wa rehung , but remains irreparably damaged . A replacement will cost a much a $ 9,000 , said the Rev . Dr. Hector B. Custodio , known to all a Pastor Benny . So far , he ha collected $ 1,200 .
 Many religious leader have become expert in applying for grant and organizing capital campaign .
 “ We learn none of this in seminary , ” said the Rev . Anne Sawyer , rector of St. Mark ’ s Church-in-the-Bowery , which is trying to raise money to replace faulty copper gutter that funnel rainwater into the building .
 But sometimes the tactic work . The Church of St. Anselm and St. Roch , for example , a domed Byzantine Revival structure in the South Bronx , recently received a $ 40,000 grant from the Landmarks Conservancy .
 Some church have allowed developer to build on their property . Residents of Morningside Heights in Upper Manhattan were still recovering from an apartment tower being erected on the campus of St. John the Divine in 2008 , when the church gave the go-ahead for a second project — to be built just step from the landmark cathedral , in 2015 .
 And then there is the sale of air right . Under the new East Midtown zoning law , landmark religious institution are able to transfer air right ( the space over their building ) to developer who can apply those air right within a 78-block area . St. Patrick ’ s , St. Bart ’ s and Central Synagogue , which supported the new rule , are all expected to sell their air right .
 The New York religious institution that are safest from destruction , it seems , have either been declared landmark or are land-rich . Trinity Church is both .
 In 2005 , Trinity hired Carl Weisbrod , an urban planning expert , director of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and founding president of the Alliance for Downtown New York , to lead the church ’ s real estate arm . Mr. Weisbrod initiated the 2013 rezoning of Hudson Square , which allowed for the construction of residential building . This set off a frenzy of development in the area and greatly enhanced the value of Trinity ’ s holding .
 Trinity then diversified , entering into a joint partnership with Norway ’ s Norges Bank Investment Management , and managed by the developer Hines , which also ha a small stake in the project , involving the church ’ s holding in Hudson Square .
 Since 2015 , proceeds from the partnership have totaled $ 1.73 billion and have been folded into a range of other investment . In 2017 , the latest year for which an audited financial statement is available , Trinity ’ s portfolio yielded a net return of $ 301 million .
 Trinity ’ s wealth enables it to support other church ( it ha it own grant department with a formal application process ) . It ha given away $ 10 million a year and plan to ramp up it contribution , according to the church spokeswoman , Ms. Walsh . It also finance it own humanitarian effort , including a 325-unit affordable residence for older people and those with disability , a well a brown-bag lunch for 35,000 annually .
 About six year ago , nearly half of Trinity ’ s vestry — a group of parishioner who function like a board of director — resigned because they felt the church wasn ’ t doing enough to help those in need . But two congregant who were part of the upheaval — including Jeremy C. Bates , who filed a lawsuit that led to the institution making it financial record public — believe the church ha turned a corner . “ I feel we are more unified , ” Mr. Bates said .
 There is a point to be made about the importance of paying attention to the bottom line . Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem , a New York City landmark with a nonprofit real estate arm that focus on affordable housing and community development , overextended itself and wa forced to sell off property to satisfy debt .
 “ We were just trying to do good where others were not doing it , ” said the Rev . Dr. Calvin O. Butts III , pastor of the church . “ We did what we could , hit a bump , and had to sell off real estate . ”
 Dr. Lupfer see the new Trinity tower a a “ ministry tool ” for his congregation and considers it cost part of it mission spending . Trinity ’ s website describes the project , rather modestly , a a “ new parish building . ”
 But it is considerably more than that , and the development process ha not been without controversy .
 Trinity ’ s original proposal — a modernist design by Pelli Clarke Pelli Architects replacing a pair of smaller building from the 1920s — wa to include luxury apartment .
 It did not go unnoticed .
 “ When Trinity Church announces it ha got to take down building that may have had some attraction for the neighborhood and replace them with something almost double in size and mostly residential , some people may have looked at a religious institution and asked question they may not have asked of a commercial developer , ” said Anthony Notaro , the chairman of Community Board 1 , covering the area south of Canal Street .
 To it credit , say member of the community , the church invited the public to weigh in on the plan for the tower ’ s podium , holding a series of workshop in St. Paul ’ s Chapel .
 As a result , art studio and public gathering space were added to the tower ’ s base , which will also contain a Sunday school , a basketball court and a computer lab .
 “ Like a 92nd Street Y , ” said Reverend Jackson , referring to the popular cultural center on the Upper East Side . Trinity expects to move into it new office this fall , with the public space opening the spring of 2020 . The church plan to reopen this Christmas .
 Trinity appears to have it all : a vibrant congregation , well-tended church building , a shiny new tower promising robust amenity — and abundant resource .
 In some respect it might even resemble the megachurches of the suburb , with their broadcasting station and satellite church to which they beam the Sunday service . Trinity ’ s own broadcast room is being updated in the renovation , a are other back-of-house space . A large split-screen monitor in the new sacristy will allow the clergy to track activity in the sanctuary a well a in St. Paul ’ s and in the parish-house portion of the new tower .
 Could big , muscular church become the new normal in New York a smaller church vanish ?
 The Rev . Dr. Donna Schaper , of Judson Memorial Church in the West Village , certainly hope not . Smaller house of worship provide not only the beauty of their historic structure , she argued , but also crucial social service a well : soup kitchen , food pantry , art program and gathering place for community meeting .
 “ We need help — technical assistance , policy relief , ” Dr. Schaper said . She maintains it is a mistake when church get into the real estate game on their own . The sale of air right , she pointed out , ha led to “ gentrification and it partner , racism , ” a demolished religious institution are replaced by luxury housing , often resulting in the displacement of longtime neighborhood resident .
 Judson Memorial , designed by Stanford White in the Romanesque style , with stained glass by John La Farge , is a designated city landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places . The church is putting on a new roof after a $ 3 million fund-raising campaign , but it must turn around and raise $ 4 million more because it ha heating issue and a broken elevator .
 The elevator is a serious concern since worship take place on the second floor . The church ha removed the pew in the sanctuary allowing for “ hyperuse , ” a Dr. Schaper put it , by a variety of group . ( Rentals yield important revenue , making up over a third of Judson ’ s $ 1 million annual budget . ) Judson provides service to 150 undocumented immigrant a week , among others .
 Dr. Schaper ha started a movement called Bricks and Mortals , with the goal of coming up with collective solution so that no church ha to go it alone . One idea is for the city to create an air-rights bank that would allow the right “ to be monetized , but not abused ” — put into a bank for the development of affordable housing , for example .
 “ My fear is that the very thing that make New York so lovely and interesting — the variety of our culture — is threatened by congregation becoming restaurant and high-end apartment . It ’ s almost a tragic a losing the beautiful building . ”

 Larry Fink , who oversees nearly $ 6 trillion of investment at BlackRock , wrote a letter to chief executive last year declaring that business must make “ a positive contribution to society . ”
 It wa seen a a turning point in the debate over the state of global capitalism , Andrew writes in his column . Some business leader bristled , but others began talking about their company ’ “ purpose ” in mission statement and official document .
 Yesterday , Mr. Fink sent chief executive another letter , arguing that business can not merely have a purpose ; they must be leader in a divided world :
 “ Stakeholders are pushing company to wade into sensitive social and political issue — especially a they see government failing to do so effectively . ”
 It ’ s a continued explanation of the stance that last year prompted Barron ’ s to call Mr. Fink “ the new conscience of Wall Street. ” Not everyone agrees with him , but he ha helped further a conversation that is undoubtedly positive , Andrew writes .
 “ I don ’ t see a recession coming ” : Mr. Fink told the FT that skittishness among investor wa natural , given the development that buffeted market toward the end of last year . But he added that he saw few sign of a global downturn .

 Goldman Sachs is orchestrating a campaign to discredit one of it former partner and minimize it role in the looting of Malaysia ’ s big state investment fund , write Matthew Goldstein , Emily Flitter and Kate Kelly .
 The news : In recent presentation to regulator and law enforcement authority , Goldman Sachs ha depicted Tim Leissner , a former top investment banker , a a master con man , according to people familiar with their content .
 The background : The scorched-earth tactic reflect just how worried the Wall Street bank is about the criminal investigation into it role in the theft of at least $ 2.7 billion from the 1Malaysia Development Berhad sovereign wealth fund , known a 1MDB .
 What ’ s at stake : Goldman recently disclosed that it set aside an additional $ 516 million to cover potential legal and regulatory penalty , including those related to 1MDB . And executive said the bank could owe another $ 2 billion .
 More banking news : Goldman reported a rise in fourth-quarter profit to $ 2.54 billion , or $ 6.04 a share , from a year ago , easily beating analyst ’ expectation . That , along with strong earnings from Bank of America , helped push major index higher and suggested that investor had underestimated the health of the economy .
 John Bogle , a longtime advocate for investor ’ right , founded Vanguard in 1974 and helped build it into a giant asset manager that today handle $ 4.9 trillion , making it second in size only to BlackRock . He had esophageal cancer , his assistant told the NYT .
 Mr. Bogle stepped down a chief executive of Vanguard in 1996 and a it chairman at the end of 1999 . Last year , his net worth wa estimated at $ 80 million — far le than many of his peer .
 His constant push to cut the cost of investing put him “ squarely into an American tradition of iconoclastic discounter like Henry Ford of Ford Motor , Sam Walton of Walmart and Michael Dell of Dell Inc. — men who built giant company by selling directly to the consumer at rock-bottom price , ” the WSJ said .
 Warren Buffett , himself an investing legend , told CNBC that Mr. Bogle “ did more for American investor a a whole than any individual I ’ ve known , ” adding :
 “ A lot of Wall Street is devoted to charging a lot for nothing . He charged nothing to accomplish a huge amount . ”
 Late last year , in an interview with Barron ’ s , Mr. Bogle noted “ cloud on the horizon ” in 2019 in the form of massive sovereign and corporate debt , “ great upheaval ” in global trade and “ the mystery of Brexit . ”
 “ A little extra caution should be the watchword , ” he said .
 Speaker Nancy Pelosi wrote to President Trump suggesting he cancel or postpone his State of the Union address , scheduled for Jan. 29 before a joint session of Congress and a prime time television audience , or that he deliver it in writing instead . She cited security concern created by the partial government shutdown , the longest in history , which entered it 27th day today .
 The president ha said he won ’ t compromise with Democrats , telling aide that his determination to build a border wall will be remembered long after the shutdown is forgotten . In moment of frustration , however , he ha privately complained about “ getting crushed , ” write Maggie Haberman and Annie Karni of the NYT .
 Some other shutdown fallout :
 • Many of the job affected are the best available in their community , coming with pension , union membership , vacation day and guaranteed pay increase . Average pay since 2000 ha grown twice a fast for federal worker a for private sector employee .
 • Several hundred thousand government employee are being asked to work without pay , including 2,500 at the Department of Agriculture who are being called back today , Friday and Tuesday . They have little choice but to comply , because of legal challenge , anti-strike law and their emotional investment in their work .
 • World Central Kitchen , founded by the celebrity chef Jose Andres , opened an emergency “ Chef for Feds ” pop-up in Washington that ha served more than 2,000 meal . Nate Mook , the nonprofit group ’ s executive director , called the shutdown a “ man-made disaster . ”
 Prime Minister Theresa May narrowly survived a vote of no confidence on Wednesday , allowing her to keep her job and helping Britain avoid a general election a it struggle to prepare for it fast-approaching withdrawal from the European Union .
 The motion wa brought by Jeremy Corbyn , the leader of the opposition Labour Party , minute after Parliament roundly rejected Mrs. May ’ s Brexit withdrawal plan on Tuesday . He is expected to heavily influence Brexit planning in the following week .
 The gridlock feel almost American . Bucking a long British tradition of lawmaker falling in line with their leader , more than 100 of Mrs. May ’ s party member rebelled in choosing to vote against her Brexit proposal .
 Could Brexit invalidate business contract ? In one of the first legal case to explore how the split will affect deal , an E.U . regulator that is relocating to Amsterdam is claiming that the 25-year lease for it site in London ha been “ frustrated ” by Brexit .
 Contingency plan for a no-deal departure . Tesco , the largest British supermarket group , is renting refrigerated container in case of supply disruption .
 Federal prosecutor in Seattle are investigating accusation that the Chinese technology giant Huawei stole intellectual property from American company .
 The case cover some of the same issue raised in a suit between Huawei , which make telecommunication equipment and smartphones , and T-Mobile . A jury found against Huawei in that suit in 2017 .
 A bipartisan group of U.S. legislator proposed bill this week to prohibit U.S. chip and other technology being sold to Huawei , ZTE and other Chinese company said to violate U.S. sanction or export control law . Lawmakers have also said that solar panel from Huawei could be hacked , potentially disrupting the flow of electricity in the United States .
 A Chinese official described the legislation a “ hysteria . ”
 Recently , Huawei invited foreign journalist to tour the sprawling campus it ’ s setting up in Dongguan , which feature town modeled after Paris , Verona and other European city — an architectural assertion of the company ’ s global ambition . Its secretive research unit will occupy a replica castle .
 Microsoft is putting up half a billion dollar to build more affordable home in the Seattle area , saying that the tech industry ha a responsibility to help people in community transformed by it growth . It promise housing for the company ’ s non-tech worker , a well a for teacher , firefighter and other middle- and low-income resident , writes Karen Weise .
 Less than a year ago , Amazon successfully pushed to block a new tax in Seattle that would have made large business fund homeless service and affordable housing .
 Microsoft ha been at the vanguard of warning about the potential negative effect of technology , and executive hope other company will follow it lead on housing .

 Welcome to Day 20 of the shutdown , which could become the longest in history on Saturday . Yesterday , President Trump stormed out of a meeting with congressional leader , throwing what Democrats described a a “ temper tantrum ” over his demand to fund a border wall , a key sticking point in talk to reopen the government . On Twitter , he called the session “ a total waste of time. ” The NYT writes :
 The contentious , brief and futile session underscored an impasse that is looking each day like an insurmountable gulf between the two side .
 Today , President Trump will visit the border in McAllen , Tex . Yesterday , he reiterated a threat to invoke emergency power to fund his wall without congressional approval . That , writes Charlie Savage in the NYT , “ would be an extraordinary violation of constitutional norm — and establish a precedent for president who fail to win approval for funding a policy goal . ”
 Some consequence of the stalemate :
 • In Washington , one of the richest area in the country , it ’ s affecting retailer , tourist center , salon , garbage bin and more .
 • Nationwide , restaurant struggling with a severe worker shortage said they will continue hiring even though they can no longer check recruit ’ immigration status online .
 • Coast Guard employee received a five-page tip sheet suggesting that they could stay afloat without their paycheck through garage sale , babysitting , dog-walking , serving a “ mystery shopper ” or , a a last resort , declaring bankruptcy .
 • This wa expected to be a banner year for I.P.O.s . But with work halted at regulator , it could be only the fourth year since 1995 when no major company go public in January . Other deal , including CVS ’ s purchase of Aetna , could also be delayed .
 Two Federal Reserve official said yesterday that the central bank should ass economic condition before it considers raising rate again . And they did so a the Fed released the minute of it December meeting , showing that it reached the same conclusion .
 The takeaway : Central bank official are now not likely to raise the benchmark interest rate at their January meeting nor at one in mid-March , writes the NYT ’ s Binyamin Appelbaum . But they still expect strong enough economic growth to justify increase this year .
 The reaction : Jerome Powell , the Fed chairman , wa criticized for not saying more to soothe investor in December . “ He could have handled that differently , and better , ” one economist said . The dollar fell to a three-month low against the euro after the meeting minute were released .
 The next step : The Fed is considering option to keep interest rate in it target range . One approach would be to slow the decline of bank reserve in the system .
 Theresa May , Britain ’ s prime minister , is getting backed into a corner over Brexit — and she know it .
 Her plan for how Britain ’ s departure from the European Union will play out are strongly expected to be rejected by Parliament in a vote next week — two and a half year after Britons voted to leave the bloc in a referendum , and a month after this vote wa first scheduled .
 Yesterday , lawmaker moved to block Mrs. May from stalling further . They have also passed a measure aimed at making it harder for the government to exit the E.U . without a deal .
 The withdrawal is scheduled for March 29 . Many are concerned that , without an agreement with Brussels in place , economic chaos could ensue . Japan ’ s prime minister , Shinzo Abe , meet with Mrs. May today , and automaker such a Honda , Nissan and Toyota , which manufacture in Britain for export into continental Europe , are pushing him to press the case against a no-deal Brexit .
 Jeremy Corbyn , the leader of the opposition Labour Party , pushed for fresh election if Parliament turn down Mrs. May ’ s plan . The British public is still deeply conflicted over the E.U. , a shown in these chart from Bloomberg .
 President Moon Jae-in of South Korea ha embraced a pro-labor program of higher wage and tax , but the early result have been discouraging , writes the NYT ’ s Michael Schuman .
 Growth ha slowed , unemployment ha risen and small-business owner are complaining . The trouble suggest South Korea ’ s limit in solving economic problem , especially without addressing underlying structural issue . Rapid change like Mr. Moon ’ s can also have unintended consequence . The biggest is the strain on small business , which are often unable to pas on higher cost to their customer .
 U.S.-North Korea talk : A second summit meeting between the North Korean leader , Kim Jong-un , and President Trump to negotiate the term of denuclearizing the North is “ close , ” Mr . Moon said today after Mr. Kim ’ s visit to China this week . He added that North Korea should take more concrete step to secure U.S. concession .
 Fiat Chrysler Automobiles will pay nearly $ 650 million to settle lawsuit over illegal software that allowed diesel vehicle to thwart emission test and release higher level of pollutant , according to the NYT .
 The settlement , which is expected to be announced today , doe not include an admission of guilt by the company or a declaration of wrongdoing by the Environmental Protection Agency . Earlier , the agency found that Fiat used technology that could turn off pollution control under certain driving condition .
 The Justice Department sued Fiat over the issue in 2017 . The company will recall 104,000 diesel-powered Ram 1500 truck and Jeep Grand Cherokee sport utility vehicle to install new software .

 It wa a dream job , visiting the globe ’ s most alluring destination on assignment . Here ’ s what our 2018 Traveler learned in a year of almost nonstop travel .
 It wa a dream job , visiting the globe ’ s most alluring destination on assignment . Here ’ s what our 2018 Traveler learned in a year of almost nonstop travel .
 By JADA YUAN Illustrations by EDEN WEINGART JAN. 4 , 2019
 The man on the train platform who spoke only Hindi looked at my ticket and chuckled . This had been one of those day when mistake piled up faster than I could track them .
 I had tarried too long in Chandigarh , India , and the four-hour taxi ride back to New Delhi now promised to be a six-hour slog in traffic . No problem , I could take a train instead , I thought , only to run out of money on my cellphone SIM card just a I wa booking a last-minute ticket . I hopped in a tuk tuk and raced to the station , and got there five minute after the last fast train had left for the night .
 When I started this harebrained experiment in January , to visit and report on the Times ’ s entire 52 Places to Go in 2018 list , I thought that by stop 48 , for sure , I ’ d be the Wonder Woman of travel : blocking mishap with a flick of my wrist . Instead I wa staring down a 2 a.m. arrival in New Delhi before having to force myself awake for a morning plane to Bhutan .
 But there wa the man on the platform — a waiter for the railway , whose job it is to pas out dinner — flashing a gesture that seemed to mean , “ Don ’ t worry , I ’ ve got you. ” I had bought an “ unreserved ” ticket , which I thought wa for people who ’ d had trouble purchasing online , but which really meant I ’ d likely have to stand for five hour .
 But when the train pulled in , the man talked to the conductor and ushered me into a sleeper car . English-speakers all around jumped in to interpret . Seven dollar in fine and upgrade fee later , I wa sitting in a cluster of bunk with four boisterous 20-something woman from New Delhi .
 The word “ dream job ” come up whenever I tell people about the 52 Places project . Like the thousand of others who answered that fateful job listing — travel the world for The New York Times ! — I had a vision of winning a journalism lottery , of getting to leave behind my routine to swim in waterfall in Australia , paraglide off mountaintops in Switzerland and eat at Michelin-starred restaurant in France . And I got to do all of those thing , for which I am incredibly grateful .
 From New Orleans to Laos , we offer a starter kit for exploring the world .


 I ’ ve also had to face reality : that constant travel — alone — on an illogical route no sane human would plan , might take a toll on my physical and mental well-being . That The Times , quite reasonably , expected me to do work and file story , which meant spending a lot of time in beautiful destination in front of a computer . That I ’ d make gaffe along the way and have to weather the sting of valid criticism . That I ’ d meet new friend only to have to say goodbye a few day later . And that I ’ d be mostly celibate , miss the birth of four close friend ’ baby , forget to call my parent . That I ’ d reach the end , and all I ’ d want is to do it over again .
 I started out , arm laden with recommendation and highlight , determined to do every one of them : Eat all the food in New Orleans , hike to the sea cave everyone go to in Tasmania , visit every mountain temple in Pyeongchang , South Korea . Yet what I remember most are the small win and human connection . The kind people and delicious salchipapas ( deconstructed hot dog with French fry ) at a Peruvian food truck on the highway outside Disney Springs , Fla . The man in Lucerne , Switzerland , who returned my laptop when I left it on a bridge in the rain . That army of concerned citizen in Chandigarh .
 Trust ha been the through-line that ha emerged from it all . Trust in myself , trust in the fundamental goodness of people , trust that a a solo female traveler , I could watch my back without walling myself off from experience .
 You see , it wa a dream job . It ’ s just that my idea of what made this dream job dreamy ha changed so much .
 I wa going on 40 , feeling sad about being single , and contemplating a sabbatical from New York Magazine , where I ’ d worked for 17 year , when I clicked on The New York Times home page and saw something curious : A job listing in the most-read article list . Did I want to travel around the world and document it ? it asked . Sure I did ! So did pretty much everyone . By the time I saw the listing , 3,500 people had already applied . The final number , they tell me , wa 13,000 .
 The odds were so impossible and the selection process so mysterious that I couldn ’ t allow myself to get too excited . And then I got the incredible phone call telling me I had three week to pack up my apartment , say goodbye to everyone I knew , quit a workplace that felt like family and set out for a year on the road .
 All through my 20 and 30 , I had watched friend move to London or West Africa , or quit their job and travel , and wondered how they possibly had the confidence to do it . I had made the huge , scary leap from New Mexico to New York City after college because it wa the one big city I knew , and I had family there . And then I stayed at the same workplace , building a career I loved while living in a series of closet-size walk-up and earning barely enough money to go home for the holiday .
 “ Why do you think they picked you ? ” interviewer often asked me , and I didn ’ t know the answer . I suspected it wa because I hadn ’ t done anything like this before . I ’ d never been brave enough . And maybe I could be a representative for those who didn ’ t think they were brave enough , either .
 Getting on that first plane to New Orleans , I felt a though I were stepping into an unknowable void from which there wa no return . The first few month were tough . Five stop in , and behind on my writing , I wound up in Bogotá , Colombia , still needing to file my article on Montgomery , Ala. ( stop No . 3 ) and Disney Springs , Fla. ( stop No . 4 ) . I spent three straight day in my Bogotá hotel , losing precious time to report on and photograph the city . The one day I got outside , I took a taxi 30 minute to the museum I wanted to see and realized I ’ d left my wallet back at the hotel .
 And I just lost it .
 I called a dear friend of mine who work for The Wall Street Journal and ha made many a global move , and sobbed .
 “ I know this feel daunting right now , ” she said , “ but you have to remember that a year is short . ”
 I argued that this wa the longest year of my life , and it wa only February , and she didn ’ t know what she wa talking about . But the saying stuck in my head and acquired new meaning whenever I ’ d hear myself complain about this wondrous opportunity .
 Freezing down to your bone and sleeping in a by-the-hour motel where you shower while sitting on the toilet ? Suck it up ! You ’ re about to see the rainbow hill of Zhangye , China ! A year is short .
 Freezing again and dinner is bar nut because you waited past 8 p.m. , when all the restaurant close ? You just rode a horse in Iceland ! A year is short .
 Car got towed in Auckland , New Zealand , while on your third trip to the Chinese consulate trying to get a visa ? But you ’ re in New Zealand ! And you ’ re going to China ! A year is short .
 A year is short and a year is not enough .
 A year is short , and I wa strong , and the risk had always been worth it .
 My 27-hour travel day from Kanazawa , Japan , to India , wa one of the trickiest of the year and I had gamed it out to the minute : A 4 a.m. taxi to the Kanazawa station , where I ’ d pick up luggage I ’ d left in a locker ; a six-hour train ride with two transfer , arriving at the Osaka airport with a generous two and a half hour to check in for my flight . I ’ d filled out the longest form in the world to get my India eVisa and paid to get it expedited . And I had a ticket for onward travel to Bhutan , having anticipating that India would require me to show I ’ d booked travel to exit the country before I could get on the plane in Japan .
 Then the AirAsia ticket counter woman asked if I had a paper copy of my eVisa . I hadn ’ t thought to print it out . Nowhere else in the world , in 47 stop , had I needed to show anything but my phone at a check-in counter .
 She couldn ’ t let me on the flight without it , she said . Check-in wa closing in 20 minute . After a mad scramble , I ended up in line at a Family Mart convenience store behind a woman printing out what looked like a 40-page dissertation , watching a the clock ticked down . The complicated printer setup required downloading an app to my phone , and by the time I had printed it out , I ’ d missed the deadline by 15 minute .
 I raced up two flight of escalator and down several long corridor , carrying the bag I hadn ’ t been allowed to check , prepared to beg the ticket agent for leniency . By some miracle the line wa still open . I handed everything over , smiling with relief , and then looked up to see my plane wa on a 2-hour delay .
 So like any reasonable person , I went back to the Family Mart and bought a basket full of sushi snack and tea-flavored Kit Kats , plus a beer to take the edge off .
 I ’ d estimate that at least 60 percent of this job wa dealing with logistics . And I even had a helper back in New York , who would research hotel and flight for me .
 Every country is different , with different currency and different language , a different pace and different cultural custom . An unreserved train ticket mean one thing in India and another in Spain . Had I done cursory research on the dual-island African nation of São Tomé and Príncipe , I would have known to show up with a wad of euro , because the society is completely cash-based and there are no ATMs foreigner can use .
 At first , I tried following travel convention that had worked for me on one-off trip : booking plane and hotel in advance , picking the absolute cheapest fare , guarding against delay by taking 6 a.m. flight , which are the least likely to be canceled . Then four 6 a.m. flight in a row , with the necessary 3 a.m. wake-up call , turned me into a zombie .
 I started listening to my rhythm . I am a night owl , for one , happy to wake up for sunrise but usually not for plane . Inflexible travel plan give me anxiety , particularly when they were coupled with work deadline .
 The trip had been planned to go from west to east , minimizing jet lag , but some time zone change knocked me out . The 24-hour travel day from Zambia to Darwin , Australia , knocked me out for day .
 I ’ ve become far calmer from having to deal with mishap after mishap , and realizing that nothing dire usually happens . There would be another plane , and more train if I missed that one , too . Maybe I ’ d lose a day , but when you ’ re on the road this long , time becomes malleable , too .
 “ So what country are you going to ? ” asked Tina Phillips , a nurse at Passport Health in Orlando , Fla. , which issue vaccination and prescription for traveler who might encounter infectious disease like malaria , rabies or Japanese encephalitis .
 I started listing off my 52 Places destination . Ms. Phillips typed the country name into the computer , her eye widening a she laughed at the absurdity . She sent me home with several needle stick in my arm , $ 1,100 in preventive medicine , a video message telling my mother not to worry , and a spiral-bound printout of all my health vulnerability .
 One of my biggest fear going into this project wa getting sick , or injured , and having to come home early — or worse , having something happen while I wa in a remote location without access to adequate medical care . Getting sick is painful , and often gross , but what worried me more wa the potential time suck on a trip so tightly scheduled that it would go off the rail if I spent day groaning on a hotel bathroom floor .
 My waistline ha expanded and diminished throughout this trip , but the medical kit I built so meticulously before I left the U.S. have remained largely untouched in my suitcase . It ’ s a stash so extensive that a custom officer at the ferry entrance to Tangier , Morocco , spent an hour threatening , in Arabic , to confiscate it and accusing me of being a drug dealer .
 Instead , I discovered I have a superpower , which may be the sole reason I ’ ve stayed relatively healthy : the ability to sleep anywhere , under any condition . Give me a window seat on an airplane and I ’ ll be light out before takeoff , no earplug , eye mask or neck pillow .
 I ’ d fall asleep in hotel on noisy street a dog barked all night , and in 20-minute chunk , regulated by an alarm , between writing paragraph of article on an all-nighter . In Tangier , two friend who joined me started looking like death because of hourlong prayer call outside our window every morning at 4 a.m . I didn ’ t even notice them .
 But the only time I ’ ve gotten really sick were the cold I caught in Seville , Spain , and Chandigarh after extensive sleep deprivation . I warded them off with a lot of nap .
 The rain in Chilean Patagonia never really seemed to stop . Every article of clothing I owned wa soaked . Soppy sock , soppy shoe . The weather matched my mood . Earlier that week , I ’ d called my friend cry yet again , and told her I wanted to quit — I wa so far behind in writing it felt like I wa drowning in obligation I couldn ’ t meet .
 What do people do when it rain like this ? I asked the hotel manager in the national park , Parque Pumalín . “ We do what we always do , ” he said . “ If we stopped for rain , nothing would ever get done . ”
 So , in a small break in the rain , I went out to do what I always do : take picture , talk to people , get to know the place .
 I wa in the tiny town of Chaitén , which had been leveled by a volcanic eruption 10 year earlier . Residents had come back , but the building closest to the slope were still abandoned . I went to examine the ghost town . A few friendly construction worker were rebuilding a house , a school . I wandered further , to an industrial building that had been overtaken by jungle growth straight out of “ Jurassic Park . ”
 The rain started up again while I wa inside , exploring the concrete corridor and coming to the realization that I wa inside an abandoned prison .
 And now I wa trapped by torrential rain .
 For two hour I watched the rain flood the dirt street before me , and the inside of this prison . I tweeted out my location , just in case . Then my phone ’ s battery died , and it wa just me and the torrent , alone in the wild of Patagonia , with the sun going down .
 I had to make a decision , and the decision wa to run , through the rain . And in that rain , soaked and running , I looked around , at the blue-tinged mountain around me , and the jungle shrub on all side , and the kind people laughing at this silly foreigner who ’ d gotten caught in an abandoned prison in the rain , and realized that all the rest wa superfluous . This wa why I wa here .
 Something crystallized for me in that moment , of how singular this trip wa . I started trying thing : I jumped off a 30-foot cliff into freezing river water while “ canyoning ” in Megève , France ; scuba dived and surfed for the first time in Fiji ; and maybe scariest of all , tried a taco with a crispy-fried ant at Gustu in La Paz , Bolivia .
 Two day ago , my friend Ben saw a dish on the menu of a barbecue joint in Phnom Penh , Cambodia , he thought I should try to commemorate making it to my 52nd place .
 “ Come on , ” he said . “ After this you can tell everyone you tried Fried Spicy Cow Penis . ”
 The whole table agreed to join me . We ordered it and the kitchen brought out Fried Spicy Beef instead . “ We changed it for you ! ” they said , cheerily .
 “ Awesome , ” said Ben . “ We also want this one . ”
 The dish came out . It looked exactly a you would imagine . Ben ate a piece . Then it wa my turn . We have video evidence . I know I said , “ try it , ” but you don ’ t need to try that one . I did it for you . You ’ re welcome .

 Those are the name , age , place and date of death of seven woman who were violently murdered while walking home , jogging , hiking or taking a birthday trip this year .
 Of all the news that ha filtered across my phone screen while I ’ ve been bouncing around the world , none had the potential to throw me into a paralytic spiral more than reading about a woman killed simply because she wa alone .
 “ Was there ever a time you felt unsafe ? ” a friend asked me recently . The answer wa no , not like I have been in the past , when I escaped attacker in my Williamsburg , Brooklyn , neighborhood or on a trip to France ; and also , “ Always . ”
 Caution a a solo female traveler is healthy ; blind fear is not . I find that for me the best system is to always remember that I am a tourist . It ’ s good to know what people who live in a place have to say about safety , but also realize that the rule that apply to them , who know where they are going , and can blend in , don ’ t apply to me .
 I ’ ve had to sacrifice area of coverage I might otherwise enjoy , like night life , because I didn ’ t feel safe going out alone . For the one destination that wa all about going out , in Belgrade , Serbia , I hired a translator-guide to keep me company , who became a fast friend . In Bogotá , I met a young female professor through Instagram who took me out with her friend for a night .
 There ’ s a literal extra cost to being a woman traveling on your own . In city where safety seemed like it might be an issue , I took cab and Ubers rather than cheaper public transport . Climbing up certain mountain or going around certain city , I opted for a guide , and often paid extra because most private tour have a two-person minimum .
 At one point , I got delayed arriving at an Airbnb I ’ d booked in Glasgow , and had to retrieve the key , after midnight , from a lockbox attached to a fence on a dark side street . A man , clearly on something , swayed back and forth about 20 foot away , a I fumbled with the combination while also trying to keep an eye on my bag . When I got inside , the apartment wa lovely , but the building looked like it had been through a bombing and never recovered . Certain landing , including mine , had no light , and glass covered the floor from broken window . I wa hanging out with a local travel writer who usually walked me home at night , but if he hadn ’ t been there , no one would have known my whereabouts .
 After that I vowed to stay only in hotel with 24-hour front desk rather than rental apartment .
 The idea of dating in a strange land quickly went out the window — I didn ’ t have time and it didn ’ t seem safe . But I didn ’ t swear off romantic leaning entirely . All told I had four make-out session all year , all in public or under what felt like very safe circumstance . Those seem like little miracle .
 Oh , the story of stranger that I could tell .
 In Montgomery , there wa Marcus , an Uber driver who ’ d grown up in what he described a “ abject poverty , ” who gave me an inspired lecture on his city ’ s complicated racial history . We picked up his neighbor , a nurse , from work , a he doe every night , and finished with a feast at Applebee ’ s .
 In Puerto Rico , there wa Blandine , a travel agent who ’ d greeted me dancing and singing by the baggage carousel , a few month after Hurricane Maria , when much of the island wa without power . A farmer , Elmer Sánchez , mentioned a party to me and my friend , and we showed up to find at least 400 people dancing to the best musician in the country playing by the light of a generator .
 In Ypres , Belgium , there were the countless people attending the Last Post Ceremony , to honor the missing fallen Commonwealth soldier of World War I , who told me the story of their valiant , dead relative , and ripped my heart in two .
 In Matera , Italy , there were Cosimo , Angelica , Mariangela , Alessandro and Marcello , who introduced me to possibly the world ’ s most delicious food , panzerotto ( fried dough with cheese and tomato sauce ) , and made me feel like I wa family , even with my rusty Italian .
 In Kigali , Rwanda , there wa M.A. , now a surrogate sister , and her entire family , who hosted me at a birthday gathering two day after I met them , while also sharing their story of surviving genocide .
 What ’ s the biggest lesson you ’ ve learned ? is a question I often get . I always answer , “ That people are fundamentally good around the world . ”
 Solo travel is an experience I ’ d urge every human , and particularly every woman , to try at least once . You ’ ll find that while you might physically be without people you know , you ’ re rarely alone . I had a device in my pocket that allowed me to call home , and to post a picture on an app that opened up conversation with stranger who just seemed to want to wish me well .
 While in Patagonia , I spent four hour climbing a volcano in the rain by myself , to reach a desolate summit with nothing but burned tree and ashen pebble . Out of the freezing cold mist came a hooded figure . “ Hablas esapañol o ingles ? ” I asked . English , he told me . He wa a vegan punk-rock drummer from Berlin who liked to laugh a lot and pet stray dog , and we ended up traveling together for the next five day .
 My parent were my rock through the ups and the down . Weekly phone call with my therapist were among the best work I did . Certain friend became lifeline . There wa Heidi Vogt , with her endless logistical know-how ; Jean Lee , an expert on Korea and also on how to pack for any eventuality ; Chiwan Choi , a poet friend who kept me clearheaded on writing ; Marie Ternes , who talked me through story idea even two day before having her first child .
 For the past week , I ’ ve stayed put in my 52nd place , the small town of Kep on the Cambodian Coast . The plan wa to spend the holiday alone in this tranquil , piece of heaven on the beach , banging out my final article .
 Then I got an Instagram DM from an acquaintance from Los Angeles . She had seen a photo I ’ d posted from Kep , and it wa a strange coincidence , but she and a girlfriend would be there the next day . Then I got another message from Ben , who life in Bangkok . He and his girlfriend , Zoe , were trying to figure out one last vacation to take before they moved to New York . Would I recommend Kep ? Within 10 minute he sent me his hotel booking and flight information .
 The next morning , I befriended a British family at my hotel and we got along so well we went on a sunset cruise together .
 The posse grew with each new arrival . We ’ d feast on crab and then head to a bar to play card until the owner kicked u out . It wa a magical holiday , and in it I could see glimpse of the future , of being surrounded by found family , content in each other ’ s company , of traveling solo but never being , or desiring to be , truly alone .
 What ’ s next ? I don ’ t know . I might be physically going back to the apartment I left behind in Brooklyn 12 month ago , but the center of my life isn ’ t there for me anymore . It ’ s with me and it ’ s mobile .

 Sacred symbol , tourist attraction , beacon for visitor and local alike : After the fire , writer reflect on the building that ha been both constant and ever-shifting in the life of Paris .
 I ’ m embarrassed by the thought of it now , nearly 30 year later : me busking in the shadow of Notre-Dame , guitar case open for donation a I belted out Bob Dylan and Neil Young song . I wa awful , yet another contributor to a particular strain of noise pollution that ha degraded the quality of life in European city center at least since Bob Marley ’ s “ Exodus ” came out . But back then you could make a lot of money in Paris if you sang with a bona fide American accent . So , that ’ s what I did night after night , planting myself at the edge of the cathedral ’ s tourist-choked parvis and parlaying an eight-song repertoire from the Liberal Arts College Songbook into a not-insignificant revenue stream .
 If you were new to Paris , a I wa , Notre-Dame is just where you ended up . It wa a lodestar , a known center from which one ’ s understanding of the city crept tentatively outward . Indeed it wa the center of the center , rising in it audacious immensity from the bedrock of the Île de la Cité , Paris ’ s historical nucleus , and exerting it gravity across the arrondissements with a force that no other structure — not even the Eiffel Tower — could summon . Really , where else wa I going to go ?
 It ’ s been surmised that the stone carver tasked with creating the hundred of figure adorning the portal of the cathedral enlisted drunk and vagrant to sit a model . “ Thus , ” observes Luc Sante in “ The Other Paris , ” “ the physical trace of the rabble is retained in the oldest , most august , most sanctified monument of the city. ” I take comfort in that notion , wincing a little le when I recall the loud , quay side drinking session , usually with musician similarly bereft of talent , into which my nightly balladeering typically descended . I ’ d seen the rabble , and the rabble wa u .
 Eventually I stopped busking in front of Notre-Dame and sought out trouble in other part of Paris , the Île de la Cité becoming in my mind a blandly familiar , anodyne quarter that I ’ d traverse when traveling from Left Bank to Right Bank or vice versa . Hurrying along the Rue de la Cité , I ’ d glance at Notre-Dame ’ s gargoyle-studded tower without giving a thought to the sheer weight of the spiritual aspiration concentrated in those stone , which had been painstakingly placed one atop the other during more than a century of continuous construction by builder whose name were never recorded , in a testament to piety and what the historian William Manchester called “ medieval man ’ s total lack of ego . ”
 If only the same could have been said of me . Like countless Paris expat , I fancied myself the antihero of my own romantic narrative , the great cathedral serving merely a a picturesque backdrop . And truth be told , I had become something of a snob when it came to open-air revelry in Paris , my taste soon inclining toward church square of more intimate dimension : St.-Sulpice , say , or St.-Étienne-du-Mont . For all it grandeur , Notre-Dame wa for greenhorn .
 Maybe it still is , though the last time I paid a visit to the Île de la Cité , I didn ’ t see any busker . The city ha installed planter and barrier that seem designed to move tourist efficiently across the parvis and discourage the kind of aimless promenading that kept the franc flying into my guitar case all those year ago . I did , however , spot a few questionable-looking 20-somethings passing a bottle in the Square de l ’ Île de France , the triangular park that constitutes the cathedral ’ s backyard . The sight wa reassuring : Fatuous youth would forever be drawn here , and Notre-Dame would forever accommodate them , a permanent a a mountain of granite . Funny how easily such certainty can be singed . DAVID McANINCH
 [ Read about the week David McAninch spent walking around the perimeter of Paris . ]
 It always seemed to be there , a much fortress a cathedral , looming over the city . It wa a wonderful sight , dominating it little island , reminding me , when I bothered to think about it , of Parisian complexity : tourist attraction , sacred edifice , Victor Hugo and Disney cartoon .
 Even a tourist , my wife and I would sometimes have lunch on a Sunday at a little restaurant with a fireplace in sight of Notre-Dame de Paris , Our Lady of Paris . One evening we took a bateau mouche , passing by the cathedral ’ s extraordinary stone , it spire lit and imposing .
 Once or twice we had dinner at La Tour d ’ Argent , the ancient and intermittently excellent restaurant , famous for it numbered pressed duck , but more cherished for it table that faced the cathedral , lit up a only Paris can light up it monument , sparking a feeling both personal and spectacular .
 Notre-Dame wa always the backdrop for a nice walk along the embankment to buy our cat pot of grass at a flower shop along the quay . But usually in a great rush to get somewhere — to work , to an appointment — the crowd surging around Notre-Dame were a nuisance , and one rarely looked up at the amazing bell tower and spire .
 And , of course , I sometimes went inside Notre-Dame , if rarely , pushing through the tourist to get a sense of the sacral and the holy , to see the magnificent rose window , to gauge the immense space , to contemplate what some believed to be the crown of thorn Jesus wore on the cross . And yes , even to light a candle , once , for my dead parent and sister .
 When we lived in Paris , Notre-Dame wa the backdrop for some of the necessary nonsense of everyday life . It sits across from the Préfecture de Police de Paris — imposing in it own way — where we regularly went , mound of document in hand , to get our carte de séjour , which let u Americans live and work in Paris . The experience wa never pleasant , exactly , trying to be perfect for bored police officer . My wife wa especially good at disarming them , usually by noticing the photo of a pet to comment upon .
 But it wa uplifting , even in the rain , to emerge from the profane to see the cathedral , the promise of another Paris , closer to the heart . STEVEN ERLANGER
 [ Read Steven Erlanger ’ s reflection on living in Paris . ]
 Depending on where you live and what you believe , a church can become a mirror of your own life . Such holy place suggest the serenity of eternity , which can help you find or repair a sense of perspective when you feel damaged or chaotic or sad .
 In Paris , there ’ s a hard wooden bench on the bank of the Seine below the Quai de la Tournelle in the Latin Quarter on the Left Bank that offer a perfect view of the backside of Notre-Dame , my preferred angle , because the elegant genius of the flying buttress ha offered me a recurring visual lesson in the power of fortitude for the 33 year I ’ ve lived in Paris . I ’ ve returned here regularly in moment of confusion and sadness . First , because the sweet smell of the dark green water of the Seine a I descend the stone staircase to the waterside reminds me of the delicious fecundity of France , but also — and perhaps most of all — because the beauty and history of the cathedral on the other side of the river put my problem in perspective by inducing humility .
 The last time I took a good look at Notre-Dame wa on a cold , rainy , early morning this past winter when I took the almost-empty Metro to the Prefecture de Police , Paris ’ s main police station , to collect my new 10-year residence card , my third . I stared up at the two Gothic tower of the facade and remembered the first time I ’ d ever seen this place , on a hot August afternoon when I wa a 15-year-old boy on my first visit to Paris with my family . The city ’ s sensuality taunted me during our stay , seducing me with pleasure I didn ’ t completely understand and which were just out of reach .
 After a month of traveling in Europe with my mother and brother , I wa frankly weary of visiting church . I ’ d had my fill of their big gloomy painting , those alarming bit and piece of saint known a relic , and the slightly melancholy smell of candle wax , the eternal scent of the hope found in faith . But on that bright day , this cathedral wa different from the others , because it moved me , and not so much in term of faith , a far a my adolescent mind had any ability to grapple with that concept , but a a place that would come to anchor a dream .
 I had fallen hard for Paris , and Notre-Dame , the heart of the city I ’ d become besotted with , offered hope that — even if I wa from Connecticut — maybe one day I , too , could become a Parisian . There wa something in the mesmerizing light of the sun streaming through the exultant kaleidoscope of stained glass that made me believe this might just be possible . Sixteen year later , I heaved my big tweed-sided suitcase onto a platform at the Gare du Nord after a long three-part ( train , boat , train ) journey from London , where I ’ d been living , and began my new life in Paris .
 My first apartment wa near the Sorbonne on the Left Bank , and so Notre-Dame amazed me anew every day a I walked to and from work at an office near the Place de la Concorde . The cathedral became a fixture of my daily life . Miraculously , I wasn ’ t a tourist anymore , but a fledgling Parisian . ALEXANDER LOBRANO
 [ Alexander Lobrano recently wrote about the affordable dining renaissance happening in Paris . ]
 To understand the power of the mighty organ at Notre-Dame , all you had to do wa stand outside . At night , when the giant wooden door were shuttered and the cathedral looked like a sleeping giant , I would sometimes be lucky enough to hear the rich but muted strain of music floating from the stone edifice while I wa out for an evening stroll .
 A talented musician wa sitting inside , alone , high above the pew , doing an after-hours practice recital on the great organ ’ s five stacked keyboard for an upcoming concert . The cathedral ’ s wall were so thick , and yet piece of the melody were punching their way from 7,800 pipe into the wider world .
 I ’ ve lived in the center of Paris for year , and one of the thing I love best about this city is taking an after-dinner walk to Notre-Dame with my husband just to soak in the Gothic facade , the monstrous gargoyle and the darkened rose window . We typically make our way through the Marais and toward the Pont Louis Philippe to cross the Seine . No matter how many time we ’ ve seen the ivory tower of Notre-Dame soar above the tip of the Île St.-Louis , they are always breathtaking .
 On summer night , the area around Notre-Dame tends to be packed with tourist , skateboarder , fire dancer and sidewalk musician . But especially in the quiet of winter , in the most special moment during these walk , we ’ d be stopped in our track on the parvis by the unexpected tone of the organ rising from behind the statue of saint and king .
 Being inside Notre-Dame while the organ wa playing wa like being taken to another dimension . Last summer , during a Bach concert , the heavy stone floor seemed to vibrate from the sheer level of decibel created with wood , air and pipe . Notre-Dame ’ s cavernous interior created a splendid acoustic chamber for the note to bloom . The organ itself radiated from an ornate carved wooden base supporting a delicate forest of steel pipe , framed by the pinkish-blue halo of the north rose window .
 So it wa with horror that we watched the flame of Monday ’ s terrible fire spreading toward Notre-Dame ’ s massive tower , marching ever closer to the giant bell and the cathedral ’ s musical heart . The organ wa installed in 1868 during Notre-Dame ’ s last major renovation at the direction of the architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc , who erected the spire that melted away in Monday ’ s flame . And now , it is an immense relief to see that many of Notre-Dame ’ s most precious treasure — including the organ — had been saved .
 But when will it be played again ? LIZ ALDERMAN

 I wa visiting Paris on Sept. 11 , 2001 . It ’ s hard to describe how incomprehensible it wa to return to a hotel room at the end of the day , blithely unaware , and see the image of destruction flicker across the TV screen . When I finally understood what had happened , it still didn ’ t make sense .
 So it wa yesterday , a I fielded text , watched video clip and stared at photo , goose bump rising on my arm . How could Notre-Dame be on fire ? How could history be crumbling before our eye ? Once again , it didn ’ t make sense .
 When I lived in Paris , eight year after that 2001 visit , Notre-Dame wa naturally on my circuit to take visiting friend and family . With my mother and stepfather , my nephew and niece , my four best friend from high school , I went . We admired the stained glass , climbed the tower , took countless photo . Each time , I had that sense of pride you get when you show something off that you really have nothing to do with .
 More than a tourist stop , Notre-Dame wa part of the fiber of my everyday life . I zoomed by it on Vélibs , working my way from the Île St.-Louis to the Left Bank . I saw it from the roof of my office on the Champs-Élysées . I sipped wine in the cafe across the street , willfully absorbing it grace .
 What we all love about Paris is that time seems to stand still . So many building and landmark have been preserved through the generation . It is unfathomable that anything could change that . Seeing Notre-Dame ’ s roof and spire engulfed in flame , I couldn ’ t help but see how frail everything really is .
 But then I saw the pompiers working the canvas hose in the street , and the crowd thronging the bridge . I heard the spontaneous singing and , finally , the decree that the fire wa under control . At the end of the day , Notre-Dame ’ s spirit remains strong . The heart of Paris keep beating . AMY THOMAS
 [ Read Amy Thomas on chocolate and Paris . ]
 The rooftop of Notre-Dame Cathedral had already closed to the public on the night I came to visit many year ago . But my guide wa François Jousse , the chief lighting engineer for the city of Paris , and he had his own set of key . He led the way up a winding , private stone staircase to the south roof to show off the new lighting system he had designed .
 We walked a long , lead-covered stretch of roof flanked by a line of flying buttress so close that I could touch them . Then we waited . Ed Alcock , the New York Times photographer who wa with u , called it the hour “ entre chien et loup ” — between the dog and the wolf — the bewitching interval between sunset and darkness when it is difficult to know exactly what you are seeing .
 We were deep into December , and the cold burned into my gloveless hand . Mr. Jousse paced back and forth to keep warm , smoking one French cigarillo after another a he anticipated the moment when darkness would come .
 Then , a if touched by an angel ’ s wand , the entire southern facade of the cathedral lit up , it pillar , gargoyle and flying buttress bathed in bright white . Giant electric light canister worthy of a theater stage framed the walkway — too hot to touch . A second set of spotlight , beamed from same bottle-green box used by the bookseller who have plied their trade on the bank of the Seine for hundred of year . A third set bolted into the Hôtel-Dieu hospital across the street completed the coat of light .
 Notre-Dame , said Mr. Jousse in solemn tone , “ is much more than a monument . Victor Hugo called it a vast symphony in stone , the colossal achievement of a man and a nation . ”
 The rooftop on which we walked is gone . The rage-filled fire on Monday engulfed it .
 For me , standing on the roof of Notre-Dame that night wa to stand on Paris ’ s history . I learned a lot about that history in researching a book about the Seine . The cathedral is the jewel of the Île de la Cité , the island in the middle of the Seine called Lutetia in ancient time . A crypt under the square in front of the cathedral hold precious remnant of the city ’ s past , including stone from a fourth-century B.C . wall built around the island , gold and bronze coin and amphora .
 The site of Notre-Dame even may have been a holy place in ancient time . Some archaeologist surmise that a pagan temple dedicated to the god Jupiter may have stood on the very spot where Notre-Dame wa built so many century later .
 As evidence , they point to the oldest Gallo-Roman monument ever discovered in Paris — a 17-foot stone pillar made from four block of stone carved with bas-reliefs . The pillar , which honored Jupiter , wa discovered in 1710 during the construction of a burial vault for the archbishop of Paris in Notre-Dame .
 Then came a church dedicated to Saint Stephen , a Merovingian basilica and Carolingian and Romanesque cathedral . Perhaps that explains why Notre-Dame seems to hold within it a quiet spirituality , even for nonbeliever , and attracts even more worshiper and tourist than Saint Peter ’ s Basilica in Vatican City .
 Mr. Jousse is retired , but still revered in Paris a “ the king of light. ” When Notre-Dame is restored to life — a it ha been so many time over the century — I hope that he will be there to adorn it once again in pure white . ELAINE SCIOLINO

 Ms. Harwood is one of the top earner on OnlyFans , where subscriber — mostly male ; straight , gay and beyond — pay model and social medium influencers a fee , generally $ 5 to $ 20 a month , to view a feed of imagery too racy for Instagram . With that access , subscriber can also direct message and “ tip ” to get picture or video created on demand , according to their sexual taste .
 Models who join the site often presume that their subscriber will increase in number if they post more often and make the content more explicit . The “ more often ” part is true . The “ more explicit ” part is not .
 At a time when anyone with a smartphone or small studio can become his or her own pornographer , and content is often free , the hottest site in the adult entertainment industry is dominated by provider who show fewer sex act and charge increasing fee depending on how creative the request get .
 That ’ s the first paradox at the center of the OnlyFans phenomenon .
 The most popular OnlyFans personality is Jem Wolfie , of Perth , Australia .
 She can ’ t help but laugh when people call her a “ fitness model. ” As she noted in an interview , “ 70 percent of my fan are men. ” So the bulk of them aren ’ t looking for exercise tip , although she may provide them , for an added fee ( along with healthy recipe — she used to be a chef ) .
 According to OnlyFans , she ha 10,000 subscriber who pay $ 10 a month for access to a feed in which she show off her Kardashianesque proportion , squatting in really tight legging and squeezing her breast together , strategically covering her nipple . “ I ’ m a thick girl , ” she said matter-of-factly .
 It doesn ’ t go much further than that .
 “ Basically , OnlyFans is online go-go dancing , ” said Matthew Camp , a 34-year-old model on the men ’ s side who broke into the business a decade ago writhing on platform around downtown Manhattan for the party promoter Susanne Bartsch .
 If the four main quadrant of the gay approval matrix were daddy , twink , bear and boy next door , he seemed to sit smack in the center , not falling neatly into any of those category but appealing to the potential audience for each .
 With a G-string and a strobe light , he could make a much a $ 1,000 on a good night . Porn studio like Lucas Entertainment began calling .
 Mr. Camp wa intrigued . “ Having sex for money is appealing , ” he said . But $ 1,000 seemed low for something that would sit on the internet and brand him for life a a porn star .
 So he turned them down and instead used a PG-13 feed on Instagram to build a following of more than half a million . About a year ago , a the club scene continued it slow death , he moved to Hudson , N.Y. , and signed up for OnlyFans .
 Weeks often went by without him posting a single picture or video . He didn ’ t show a full penetrative sex clip for the first nine month , yet he still regularly took home more than $ 10,000 a month .
 “ Tumblr wa filled with the most extreme sexual experience you could see , ” he said . “ And I think a lot of people were turned off by that . It ’ s not what they ’ re looking for . They want more intimate experience . They want a boyfriend experience . They want to fantasize about someone that they want to have sex with and not feel disgusted by it . ”
 From the late 1990s to the early 2000s , dreamer in the porn industry , centered in the San Fernando Valley of California , openly described their multi-million-dollar future in the business . There wa actually a history of this happening , at least for a small number of model signed to lucrative long-term contract with studio like Vivid and Wicked .
 They could make north of $ 5,000 a scene and shoot a couple of those each week , according to Brian Gross , a well-known industry publicist . That income could be supplemented with five-figure sum doing nightclub appearance around the country on the weekend , he said .
 Jenna Jameson — the Julia Roberts of straight porn — even parlayed her notoriety into a memoir released by HarperCollins , “ How to Make Love Like a Porn Star : A Cautionary Tale , ” which wa a New York Times best seller . The title turned out to be eerily prescient . As it publisher , Judith Regan , pointed out : “ Porn went the way of all media. ” It turn out , everyone could do it .
 Except that because porn wa an industry of people already living on the margin of society , the effect for the performer were in many way worse .
 The primary culprit were so-called tube site : YouTube-like platform that aggregated stolen pornographic content , disseminated it for free and sucked up revenue from banner and video ad .
 Since porn studio did not have the capital or political connection to sue their most threatening adversary out of business ( a the record industry did ) , rate for scene work dropped . Fewer scene were shot overall . Eventually , the studio began selling themselves to the tube site at fire-sale price .
 It wa a if the entire music business had been subsumed by Napster .
 By 2015 , a handful of company were able to exert monopolistic control over the industry . MindGeek is the biggest player of all . The crown jewel of it empire is Pornhub ( perhaps the most popular tube site in the world ) , which is supplied with content from numerous in-house production company of the straight ( Brazzers.com , Reality Kings ) and gay variety ( SeanCody , Men.com ) .
 MindGeek know all about porn habit by doing comprehensive data analysis . It ha shown le of an affinity for the product or the people who appear in it .
 The MindGeek website make no reference to the fact that the overwhelming majority of it customer are consumer of hard-core pornography .
 The technocrat who built the company got rich . Many of the performer who helped enable their success became prostitute , offering their service on website like RentMen.com and The Erotic Review when scene work ceased to be a viable way to make a living .
 It ’ s a fitting but unfortunate parable in an era of rampant economic inequality .
 “ If you have a known name , it ’ s much easier to market your service , ” said Dirk Caber , a porn star who ha filmed close to 40 scene for MindGeek ’ s most popular gay site , Men.com , since 2013 . Most of his income come from his work a an escort , because this scene work pay so little .
 “ The whole industry did a 180 , ” Mr . Gross said . “ When I started , there were actually website that would out famous porn star if they escorted , because it wa shocking , for lack of a better word . Now , all talent is looked at a if they are escort , and those who aren ’ t have to come out and say so . ”
 One alternative to escorting is webcamming . In England , there are even TV station , like Playboy and Babestation , on which model talk live with thousand of customer and earn several hundred dollar a day .
 That ’ s what Ms. Harwood did before OnlyFans came along .
 She grew up in Wales , with a mother who stocked supermarket shelf and a father who wa a factory worker .
 It wa a “ typical working-class ” household , she said recently , while on a vacation in New York that included a trip to the 9/11 memorial and the taking of many hotel room selfies .
 As a little girl , Ms. Harwood wa a relentless attention seeker , the sort who appeared in school play , competed in beauty pageant and studied dance . She also had reservoir of empathy that would serve her well later in life .
 She could spot pain in others and find way to make them feel better . She also wa capable of identifying her limitation and finding way to chart new path for herself . “ I wa raised well , ” she said .
 She studied dance at Laine Theatre Arts , a prestigious drama and dance college near London . Then , “ I went to audition after audition , ” she said . “ Eventually , I realized I wasn ’ t good enough . And it wa quite hard to accept at first . ”
 Around 2005 , Ms. Harwood posed topless on Page 3 of The Daily Sport , a second-tier British newspaper that she said “ wa popular with day laborer and construction worker . ”
 This apparently included the guy her father worked with .
 One morning , he went into work and saw the picture of his daughter plastered to his locker .
 On her face , his colleague had drawn his mustache and glass . That ’ s how he found out she wa modeling nude . That ’ s why he warned her about being disowned .
 Ms. Harwood felt terrible . Although she like taking off her clothes for other people , she seems driven le by the desire to transgress than the desire to please . If she were reincarnated a a Disney character , she ’ d be Jessica Rabbit , not Miss Piggy .
 But it wasn ’ t like her father had the money to support her . His warning wa sort of an empty threat . So she kept going , with appearance in Playboy and British so-called laddie magazine .
 In 2011 , Ms. Harwood worked for a soft-core site called GlamGirls and became friendly with it owner , Tim Stokely , an earnest technocrat who look like Mark Zuckerberg by way of Savile Row . Soon after , Mr. Stokely founded a site called Customs4U , which Ms. Harwood said , lightheartedly , may have been her idea and wa like OnlyFans in beta .
 The pitch wa to offer horny guy the ability to become their own director , ordering specially made video from their favorite model .
 It sputtered along while Instagram — which is free and doesn ’ t allow full nudity — took off . Then Mr. Stokely had his light bulb moment : Why not find a way for influencers to directly monetize their content . The platform — OnlyFans — would be similar to Instagram or Twitter except fan would have to pay a monthly subscription to view influencers ’ content and interact with them .
 It would therefore be a natural bolt-on to the influencer ’ s existing social medium . A free feed on Instagram or Twitter could promote and drive traffic to the subscription-only feed on OnlyFans .
 Eighty percent of the fee collected for each feed would go to the provider . Twenty percent would go to OnlyFans ( although after merchant and processing fee , Mr. Stokely say it take is around 12 percent ) . This is roughly the same arrangement Uber ha with it driver , except that OnlyFans didn ’ t push performer toward poverty by dictating the price they could charge .
 When OnlyFans started , in 2016 , Ms. Harwood wa one of just 10 model who sought subscriber . She didn ’ t think much would come of it initially . Her earnings for the first month were $ 257 .
 Then , the site added feature enabling model to create custom content . Ms. Harwood got inventive .
 She introduced themed day like Mistress Mondays and Dare Dannii Tuesdays , when men bid to watch her drive around town in her underwear and order a pizza to her home , whereupon she would answer the door naked . She also chatted with fan daily , learning their habit , their sexual predilection and their insecurity .
 “ You can get porn for free , ” she said . “ Guys don ’ t want to pay for that . They want the opportunity to get to know somebody they ’ ve seen in a magazine or on social medium . I ’ m like their online girlfriend . ”
 Ms. Harwood took out her phone and showed evidence of her theory .
 She brought home $ 29,420.47 in August , $ 34,303.24 in September , $ 52,693.29 in October and $ 52,760.49 in November .
 Although OnlyFans ha brilliantly capitalized off the life ’ s work of exhibitionist , it is run by people whose most apparent trait is opacity .
 That ’ s the second paradox at the center of it existence .
 There is no website for Fenix International Limited , which is the parent company of OnlyFans . It doe have a publicist , Daniel Blythe , who largely help the men behind it avoid interview .
 When I first contacted Mr. Blythe , in November , informing him of my intention to write about OnlyFans , he wa affable a could be for a man with no intention of disclosing the name of his client , much le submitting them to an interview .
 When I did discover Mr. Stokely ’ s name and portion of his back story , with a little help from someone on Reddit , Mr. Blythe offered the warmest of congratulation . “ Refreshing to know that investigative journalism isn ’ t dead , ” he said .
 Still , the best he could offer were written response to question for Mr. Stokely , the company ’ s chief executive . The answer were maddeningly vague , but Mr. Stokely did say that he work at Fenix with his father , Guy Stokely , who , before becoming it chairman , wa an investment banker with Barclays , the storied British bank .
 Mr. Stokely also confirmed that one of Fenix ’ s director is Leo Radvinsky , a 2003 Northwestern University graduate who went on to start MyFreeCams ( one of the industry ’ s largest chat site ) and who ha been a defendant in three lawsuit related to phishing attempt and patent infringement . ( Mr. Blythe said he could not comment on the status of those lawsuit because they “ do not pertain to OnlyFans . ” )
 Mr. Stokely is eager to take OnlyFans out of the pornography niche and make it a platform for all sort of influencers and audience .
 One hurdle is that there is no iPhone app . The platform a it exists now likely run afoul of Apple ’ s restriction on “ overtly sexual or pornographic material. ” And even if Apple did allow an OnlyFans app , the fee — 30 percent — would certainly be a problem , Mr. Stokely said . He would have to pas along those expense to performer .
 Technical problem on OnlyFans also threaten it longevity and help explain why synonymous site , such a JustFor.Fans , have managed to siphon off considerable number of performer and revenue .
 Still , Chanel Santini , a 21-year-old performer who ha been with OnlyFans for more than a year and earns at least $ 8,000 a month in subscription revenue , can ’ t muster serious complaint .
 Not when she experienced the alternative .
 She grew up in Albuquerque with a single mother who wa a hairdresser . Ms. Santini came out a transgender when she wa a teenager . That got her thrown out of the house . She never finished high school .
 In 2015 , Ms. Santini moved to Las Vegas and took a job a a clerk at Hollister , the clothing chain . Even in a city with a fairly low cost of living , it wasn ’ t enough .
 So she started doing porn , filming scene that paid a little a $ 400 , which then led to escorting . She worked for a madam who stole her money , she said , and threatened her with violence .
 With popular feed on Instagram and Twitter , Ms. Santini ’ s name got bigger . OnlyFans started and she signed up .
 A couple of week ago , she burst into tear over the phone while recalling her first pornographic shoot . There , a director had told her that the only way to make a living in porn wa to also be a prostitute .
 “ He said that straight to my face , ” she said . “ Now , I just want to run into him again , so I can say , ‘ Well , here I am . I ’ m pulling in ten of thousand of dollar every month just posting content online . I don ’ t have to escort anymore . I don ’ t have to do that . Guess you were wrong ! ’ ”

 Murdoch and his child have toppled government on two continent and destabilized the most important democracy on Earth . What do they want ?
 Part 1 : Imperial Reach Murdoch and his child have toppled government on two continent and destabilized the most important democracy on Earth . What do they want ?
 By JONATHAN MAHLER and JIM RUTENBERG APRIL 3 , 2019
 Rupert Murdoch wa lying on the floor of his cabin , unable to move . It wa January 2018 , and Murdoch and his fourth wife , Jerry Hall , were spending the holiday cruising the Caribbean on his elder son Lachlan ’ s yacht . Lachlan had personally overseen the design of the 140-foot sloop — named Sarissa after a long and especially dangerous spear used by the army of ancient Macedonia — ensuring that it would be suitable for family vacation while also remaining competitive in superyacht regatta . The cockpit could be transformed into a swimming pool . The ceiling in the child ’ s cabin became an illuminated facsimile of the nighttime sky , with separate switch for the Northern and Southern Hemispheres . A detachable board for practicing rock climbing , a passion of Lachlan ’ s , could be set up on the deck . But it wa not the easiest environment for an 86-year-old man to negotiate . Murdoch tripped on his way to the bathroom in the middle of the night .
 Murdoch had fallen a couple of other time in recent year , once on the stair while exiting a stage , another time on a carpet in a San Francisco hotel . The family prevented word from getting out on both occasion , but the incident were concerning . This one seemed far more serious . Murdoch wa stretchered off the Sarissa and flown to a hospital in Los Angeles . The doctor quickly spotted broken vertebra , which required immediate surgery , a well a a spinal hematoma , increasing the risk of paralysis or even death . Hall called his adult child in a panic , urging them to come to California prepared to make peace with their father .
 Few private citizen have ever been more central to the state of world affair than the man lying in that hospital bed , awaiting his child ’ s arrival . As the head of a sprawling global medium empire , he commanded multiple television network , a global news service , a major publishing house and a Hollywood movie studio . His newspaper and television network had been instrumental in amplifying the nativist revolt that wa reshaping government not just in the United States but also across the planet . His 24-hour news-and-opinion network , the Fox News Channel , had by then fused with President Trump and his base of hard-core supporter , giving Murdoch an unparalleled degree of influence over the world ’ s most powerful democracy . In Britain , his London-based tabloid , The Sun , had recently led the historic Brexit crusade to drive the country out of the European Union — and , in the chaos that ensued , helped deliver Theresa May to 10 Downing Street . In Australia , where Murdoch ’ s power is most undiluted , his outlet had led an effort to repeal the country ’ s carbon tax — a first for any nation — and pushed out a series of prime minister whose agenda didn ’ t comport with his own . And he wa in the midst of the biggest deal of his life : Only a few week before his fall on Lachlan ’ s yacht , he shook hand on a London rooftop with Robert A. Iger , the chief executive of the Walt Disney Company , consummating a preliminary agreement to sell his TV and film studio , 21st Century Fox , to Disney for $ 52.4 billion . But control of this sprawling empire wa suddenly up in the air .
 The four grown child had differing claim to the throne . The 61-year-old Prudence , the only child of Murdoch ’ s first marriage , to the Australian model Patricia Booker ( whom he divorced in 1965 ) , lived in Sydney and London and kept some distance from the family business . But the three child from Murdoch ’ s second marriage , to Anna Mann ( whom he divorced in 1999 ) , had spent at least part of their life jockeying to succeed their father . Elisabeth ( 50 ) , Lachlan ( 47 ) and James ( 46 ) all grew up in the business . As child , they sat around the family ’ s breakfast table on Fifth Avenue , listening to their father ’ s tutorial on the morning paper : how the article were selected and laid out , how many ad page there were . All of them had imagined that his ever-growing company might one day belong to them . As friend of the Murdochs liked to say , Murdoch didn ’ t raise child ; he raised future medium mogul .
 It had made for fraught family dynamic , with competing ambition and ever-shifting alliance . Murdoch wa largely responsible for this state of affair : He had long avoided naming one of his child a his successor , deferring an announcement that might create still more friction within his family , not to mention bringing into focus his own mortality . Instead , Murdoch tried to manage the tension , arranging for group therapy with his child and their spouse with a counselor in London who specialized in working with dynastic family . There wa even a therapeutic retreat to the Murdoch ranch in Australia . But these session provided just another forum for power game and manipulation .
 [ Read 6 takeaway from this story . ]
 Over the year , Lachlan and James had traded role , more than once , a heir apparent and jilted son . It wa no secret to those close to the family that Murdoch had always favored Lachlan . ( “ But I love all of my child , ” Murdoch would say when people close to him pointed out his clear preference for Lachlan . ) But it wa James who spent the first decade of the 21st century helping reposition the company for the digital future — exploiting new market around the world , expanding online offering , embracing broadband and streaming technology — while his older brother wa mostly off running his own business in Australia after a bitter split from their father . When Lachlan finally agreed to return to the United States in 2015 , Murdoch gave him and James dueling senior title : All the company ’ s division would report jointly to them . It wa an awkward arrangement , not only because they were both putatively in charge of a single empire . James and Lachlan were very different people , with very different politics , and they were pushing the company toward very different future : James toward a globalized , multiplatform news-and-entertainment brand that would seem sensible to any attendee of Davos or reader of The Economist ; Lachlan toward something that wa at once out of the past and increasingly of the moment — an unabashedly nationalist , far-right and hugely profitable political propaganda machine .
 Only one of Murdoch ’ s adult child would win the ultimate prize of running the world ’ s most powerful medium empire , but all four of them would ultimately have an equal say in the direction of it future : Murdoch had structured both of his company , 21st Century Fox and News Corp , so that the Murdoch Family Trust held a controlling interest in them . He held four of the trust ’ s eight vote , while each of his adult child had only one . He could never be outvoted . But he had also stipulated that once he wa gone , his vote would disappear and all the decision-making power would revert to the child . This meant that his death could set off a power struggle that would dwarf anything the family had seen while he wa alive and very possibly reorder the political landscape across the English-speaking world .
 As the child hurried to their father ’ s bedside in Los Angeles , it seemed a if that moment had finally arrived .
 Media power ha historically accrued slowly , over the course of generation , which is one reason it tends to be concentrated in dynastic family . The Graham family owned The Washington Post for 80 year before selling it to Amazon ’ s founder , Jeff Bezos . William R. Hearst III still presides over the Hearst Corporation , whose root can be traced to his great-grandfather , the mining-baron-turned-United-States-senator George Hearst . The New York Times ha been controlled by the Ochs-Sulzberger family for more than a century . The Murdoch empire is a relatively young one by comparison , but it would be hard to argue that there is a more powerful medium family on earth .
 The right-wing populist wave that looked like a fleeting cultural phenomenon a few year ago ha turned into the defining political movement of the time , disrupting the world order of the last half-century . The Murdoch empire did not cause this wave . But more than any single medium company , it enabled it , promoted it and profited from it . Across the English-speaking world , the family ’ s outlet have helped elevate marginal demagogue , mainstream ethnonationalism and politicize the very notion of truth . The result have been striking . It may not have been the family ’ s mission to destabilize democracy around the world , but that ha been it most consequential legacy .
 Over the last six month , we have spoken to more than 150 people across three continent about the Murdochs and their empire — some who know the family intimately , some who have helped them achieve their aim , some who have fought against them with varying degree of success . ( Most of these people insisted on anonymity to share intimate detail about the family and it business so a not to risk retribution . ) The medium tend to pay a lot of attention to the medium : Fox News is covered almost a closely a the White House and often in the same story . The Murdochs themselves are an enduring object of cultural fascination : “ Ink , ” a play about Rupert ’ s rise , is opening soon on Broadway . The second season of HBO ’ s “ Succession , ” whose fictional medium family , the Roys , bear a striking resemblance to the Murdochs , air this summer . But what we a reporter had not fully appreciated until now is the extent to which these two story — one of an illiberal , right-wing reaction sweeping the globe , the other of a dynastic medium family — are really one . To see Fox News a an arm of the Trump White House risk missing the larger picture . It may be more accurate to say that the White House — just like the prime minister ’ office in Britain and Australia — is just one tool among many that this family us to exert influence over world event .
 What do the Murdochs want ? Family dynamic are complex , too , and medium dynasty are animated by different factor — workaday business imperative , the desire to pas on wealth , an old-fashioned sense of civic duty . But the Murdochs ’ global operation suggest a different dynastic orientation , one centered on empire building in the original sense of the term : territorial conquest . Murdoch began with a small regional paper in Australia , inherited from his father . He quickly expanded the business into a national and then an international force , in part by ruthlessly using his platform to help elect his preferred candidate and then ruthlessly using those candidate to help extend his reach . Murdoch ’ s news empire is a monument to decade ’ worth of transactional relationship with elected official . Murdoch ha said that he “ never asked a prime minister for anything. ” But press baron don ’ t have to ask when their medium outlet can broadcast their desire . Politicians know what Murdoch want , and they know what he can deliver : the base , their voter — power .
 The Murdoch approach to empire building ha reached it apotheosis in the Trump era . Murdoch had long dreamed of having a close relationship with an American president . On the surface , he and Trump have very little in common : One is a global citizen with home around the world , a voracious reader with at least some sense of self-awareness . ( Murdoch wa photographed last year on the beach reading “ Utopia for Realists , ” by Rutger Bregman , the Dutch historian who later told Tucker Carlson in an interview that Carlson wa a “ millionaire funded by billionaires. ” ) The other is a proudly crass American who vacation at his own country club , dines on fast food and watch a lot of TV . But they are each a son of an aspiring empire builder , and their respective dynasty shared the same core value — growth through territorial conquest — and employed the same method to achieve it , leveraging political relationship to gain power and influence . In Trump ’ s case , these relationship helped him secure zoning exemption , tax abatement and global licensing deal ; in Murdoch ’ s case , they allowed him to influence and evade antimonopoly and foreign-ownership rule .
 Murdoch ha carefully built an image during his six decade in medium a a pragmatist who will support liberal government when it suit him . Yet his various news outlet have inexorably pushed the flow of history to the right across the Anglosphere , whether they were advocating for the United States and it ally to go to war in Iraq in 2003 , undermining global effort to combat climate change or vilifying people of color at home or from abroad a dangerous threat to a white majority .
 Even a his empire grew — traversing ocean , country and medium — Murdoch saw to it that it would always remain a family business . Underpinning it wa a worldview that the government wa the enemy of an independent medium and a business model that depended nonetheless on government intervention to advance his interest and undermine those of his competitor . The Murdoch dynasty draw no line among politics , money and power ; they all work together seamlessly in service of the overarching goal of imperial expansion .
 It would be impossible for an empire a sprawling a Murdoch ’ s to be completely culturally and ideologically consistent . He is a businessman who want to satisfy his customer . His asset also include entertainment company , sport network and moderate broadsheet . Murdoch embodies these same contradiction . He ’ s an immigrant stoking nationalism , a billionaire championing populism and a father who never saw any reason to keep his family separate from his business , and in fact had deliberately merged the two .
 Most dynasty break apart eventually , a decision-making power is dispersed across individual and generation with different attitude about their family business and the world in general . No one know this better than Murdoch , who in 2007 took over Dow Jones , publisher of The Wall Street Journal , by exploiting division within the Bancroft family , which had run the paper for more than a century . Murdoch thought he had protected himself from a similar fate by keeping a controlling interest in his empire ; no one could take it away from him .
 The challenge would be holding it together .
 To understand how the Murdoch empire work , it is essential to return to it origin . On the day in 1931 that Rupert Murdoch wa born , his father , Keith Murdoch , wa in the midst of his first campaign to elect a prime minister from his newsroom in Australia . As a young newspaperman , Keith gained fame by evading military censor to report on the slaughter of his countryman during the British-led Gallipoli campaign of World War I . He leveraged that fame to become a powerful executive at the Melbourne Herald and Weekly Times news company , a position that he in turn leveraged to punish his enemy and reward his ally : The candidate he wa supporting for prime minister , Joseph Lyons , earlier helped Keith overcome regulatory restriction to start a radio station for his company in Adelaide , according to the historian Tom Roberts ’ s 2015 biography of Murdoch ’ s father , “ Before Rupert. ” Lyons won , and a Keith saw it , Australia ’ s new leader served at his pleasure : “ I put him there , ” he reportedly said when the two later squabbled . “ And I ’ ll put him out . ”
 As Keith wa creating one of the country ’ s first national news chain , a regional Australian newspaper editorialized about the danger of his ambition , warning , Roberts wrote , that he wa creating “ a press dictatorship for all Australia with Murdoch-inspired leader and Murdoch-trained reporters. ” Bound up with Keith ’ s business interest were ideological inclination not just about how power should work but also about who should be allowed to exercise it : He wa a member of the Eugenics Society of Victoria and in an editorial once wrote that the great question facing Britain wa “ will she , if need be , fight — for a White Australia ? ”
 Keith never built a true medium empire . He did own two regional newspaper , one of which had to be sold to pay off his death duty when he died suddenly in 1952 . That left only the 75,000-circulation News of Adelaide for his 21-year-old son , who wa finishing his degree at Oxford . But Rupert Murdoch had already received something much more valuable from his father : an extended tutorial in how to use medium holding to extract favor from politician .
 His first order of business wa to establish a proper Murdoch-owned empire in Australia . After buying a couple of additional local paper , he founded the country ’ s first national general-interest newspaper , The Australian , which gave him a powerful platform to help elect government that eased national regulation designed to limit the size of medium company . He would eventually take control of nearly two-thirds of the national newspaper market . With the construction of his Australian medium empire underway , Murdoch moved on to Britain and Fleet Street , using his newest acquisition , The News of the World and The Sun , to successfully promote Margaret Thatcher ’ s candidacy for prime minister . Once elected , her government declined to refer his acquisition of The Times of London to antimonopoly regulator , giving him the country ’ s leading establishment broadsheet to go with his mass-circulation tabloid .
 Television wa next . After Murdoch lost the bidding for the British government ’ s sole satellite broadcasting license , Thatcher again came to his rescue , looking the other way when he started a rival service , Sky Television , which beamed programming into Britain from Luxembourg . The bigger Murdoch ’ s empire became , the more power he had to clear away obstacle to further it expansion . His influence became an uncomfortable fact of British political life , and Murdoch seemed to revel in it . “ It ’ s The Sun Wot Won It , ” The Sun declared on it front page in 1992 , after helping send the Tory leader John Major to 10 Downing Street by relentlessly smearing the character of his opponent , Neil Kinnock . ( “ Nightmare on Kinnock Street , ” The Sun headlined a savage nine-page package that included a satirical endorsement from the ghost of Joseph Stalin . ) Murdoch could switch party when it suited his purpose and ably supported Britain ’ s “ New Labor ” movement in the 1990s : Conservatives at the time had proposed regulation that would have forced him to scale back his newspaper operation in order to expand further into TV .
 Murdoch used the same playbook in the United States . In 1980 , he met Roy Cohn — the former adviser to Senator Joseph McCarthy and a Trump mentor — who introduced him to Gov . Ronald Reagan ’ s inner circle . It wa a group that included Roger Stone Jr. , another Trump confidant and the head of Reagan ’ s New York operation , who said in a later interview that he helped Murdoch weaponize his latest tabloid purchase , The New York Post , on Reagan ’ s behalf in the 1980 election . Reagan ’ s team credited Murdoch with delivering him the state that year — Murdoch gave Stone an Election Day printing plate from The Post over a celebratory meal at the 21 Club — and his administration subsequently facilitated Murdoch ’ s entry into the American television market , quickly approving his application for American citizenship so he could buy TV station too .
 The Reagan administration later waived a prohibition against owning a television station and a newspaper in the same market , allowing Murdoch to hold onto his big metro daily , The New York Post and The Boston Herald , even a he moved into TV in both city . The administration of George H.W . Bush suspended rule that forbade broadcast network to own prime-time show or to profit from them . That move allowed Murdoch to build the nation ’ s fourth broadcast network by rapidly filling out his schedule with show from his newly acquired 20th Century Fox studio — “ The Simpsons , ” “ 21 Jump Street ” — while also earning substantial profit from the production unit ’ s syndicated rerun hit like “ M*A*S*H ” and “ L.A . Law . ”
 Maybe more than any medium mogul of his generation , Murdoch exploited the seismic change transforming the industry during the waning year of the 20th century ( another lesson from Keith , an early adopter of radio and newsreel ) . These change were driven by technology : It wa now possible to transmit endless amount of content all over the world in an instant . But they were also driven by regulatory change , in particular the liberation of TV and radio operator from the government guideline that ruled the public airwave . The Reagan administration ’ s elimination of the Fairness Doctrine , which had for decade required broadcaster to present both side of any major public-policy debate , spawned a new generation of right-wing radio personality who were free to provide a different sort of opinion programming to a large , latent conservative audience that wa mistrustful of the medium in general . It wa only a matter of time until similar programming started migrating to the burgeoning medium of 24-hour-a-day cable television . And it wa of course Murdoch who imported it .
 Murdoch had watched enviously a his younger rival , Ted Turner , built his own cable news network , CNN . In 1996 , he and Roger Ailes , a former medium adviser for Nixon and George H.W . Bush , started their conservative competitor , Fox News , which catered to those Americans whose political preference had gone unaddressed on television news . Another political favor wa crucial . When Time Warner , which owned CNN , refused to carry the new network on it cable system in New York , the city ’ s Republican mayor , Rudolph W. Giuliani — another future Trump adviser and a lion in the page of The Post — publicly pressured the cable company a the two side moved toward an eventual deal .
 A round-the-clock network with a virtual monopoly on conservative TV news , Fox conferred on Murdoch a whole new sort of influence that wa enhanced by politically polarizing event like the Monica Lewinsky scandal and the post-Sept. 11 war in Iraq that marked it early year . If Murdoch ’ s paper were a blunt instrument , Fox ’ s influence wa in some way more subtle , but also far more profound : Hour after hour , day after day , it wa shaping the reality of the million of Americans who treated it a their primary news source . A 2007 study found that the introduction of the network on a particular cable system pushed local voter to the right : the Fox News Effect , a it became known . In a 2014 Pew Research poll , a majority of self-described conservative said it wa the only news network they trusted . Murdoch ’ s office above the Fox newsroom in Midtown Manhattan became a requisite stop on any serious Republican presidential candidate ’ s schedule .
 Fifty year and an untold number of deal after taking possession of The News of Adelaide , Murdoch had arrived at the pinnacle of global influence . “ Republicans originally thought that Fox worked for u , ” David Frum , a former speechwriter for George W. Bush , said in an interview with “ Nightline. ” “ And now we ’ re discovering we work for Fox . ”
 Murdoch ’ s success in building his empire inevitably raised the question of who would rule it after he wa gone . As he grew older , he would often say privately that he didn ’ t want to become another Sumner Redstone , the aging medium mogul who had refused to cede control of CBS and Viacom , even a he wa losing the ability to speak or eat unassisted . But a he turned 75 , and then 80 , Murdoch , too , had declined to lay out a plan for the future of his empire .
 Initially he favored Lachlan , installing him a the general manager of one of his Australian newspaper chain at age 22 and overseeing his rise to the post of deputy chief operating officer of News Corp by age 33 . But Lachlan ’ s rise wa cut short after he clashed repeatedly with seasoned executive who viewed him a an entitled princeling . Furious at his father for siding against him in these dispute , Lachlan left the company — and the United States — in 2005 , returning to the Murdochs ’ ancestral homeland with a $ 100 million payout from the family trust . James , then the chief executive of British Sky Broadcasting — formerly Sky Television , later shortened to Sky — took over the mantle of heir apparent .
 But by the summer of 2015 , Murdoch , now 84 , had changed his mind : James wa out , and Lachlan wa once again next in line . The news wa delivered to James not by his father but by Lachlan and the company ’ s president , Chase Carey , over lunch in Manhattan : Lachlan wa moving back to the United States to take over the business . James would report to him .
 James wa livid . The two brother and their father had explicitly discussed succession not even two year earlier . James wa supposed to take over , and Lachlan would never assume more than a symbolic role . As James saw it , he had not only been promised the job ; he had earned it . He had devoted year of his life to trying to build the company — moving his family to Hong Kong and London , making monthly trip to Mumbai to push the family ’ s satellite-TV business into emerging technology and new market — while his brother wa off in Australia spearfishing and making dubious investment . Angry and appalled , James threatened to quit , heading straight from lunch to the airport for a flight to Indonesia .
 With a clipped , near-British accent and a penchant for wearing bluejeans and espadrille , James read a an archetype of today ’ s global power elite . Years ago , he wa the family rebel , piercing his ear , dyeing his hair and having a light bulb tattooed on his right arm . As an undergraduate at Harvard , James flirted with becoming a medieval historian and joined the staff of The Harvard Lampoon before dropping out in 1995 to follow the Grateful Dead and start an independent hip-hop label , Rawkus Records , whose artist included Talib Kweli and Mos Def . A year later , his father bought Rawkus and brought James into News Corp , ending his short-lived foray outside the family business . In 2000 , James married Kathryn Hufschmid , a fashion-marketing executive and part-time model from Oregon , whom he met on a mutual friend ’ s yacht bound for Fiji and whose more liberal politics made her an outlier in the Murdoch family . She argued frequently with her father-in-law over Fox ’ s politics . The constant sparring grew tiresome for Murdoch , who worried that Kathryn had too much influence over his younger son . He would often suggest to James that the two of them just go out to dinner alone when they needed to discus something , according to a person close to Murdoch .
 Even inside his father ’ s empire , James continued to view himself in idealistic term , a the one best suited to drag the sprawling , often backward-thinking company into the future , whether that meant making all of it office carbon-neutral , leading investment in digitally oriented business like Hulu or moderating the wilder impulse of Fox News . A self-described political centrist , James saw the network a one of the biggest obstacle to his effort to diversify and expand the company . In a meeting of senior executive , one attendee recalled , he said he wanted to change the image of the Murdoch empire so that it wa no longer viewed a a company “ defined by a single product with a charismatic founder . ”
 Lachlan identified closely with that charismatic founder . His trajectory wa very different from James ’ s . He shared his father ’ s attachment to Australia , both to his family ’ s long history inside the country and to it hypermasculine , rough-hewed culture . When he wa younger , he worked a a jackeroo , herding and vaccinating sheep and lamb in rural Australia , and culled kangaroo from the family ’ s ranch in Cavan with a shotgun . ( His father stuck to clay pigeon . ) After graduating from Princeton , Lachlan returned to Australia to work in the family business , becoming an instant celebrity , known for wearing outback boot with his suit , riding a Kawasaki motorcycle to work , showing off his armband tattoo while rock climbing and courting the Australian model Sarah O ’ Hare , whom he married in 1999 .
 Lachlan doesn ’ t speak publicly about his politics , but his employee in Australia found that he took a hard line on many issue . Chris Mitchell , the longtime editor of The Australian , recalled in his 2016 memoir , “ Making Headlines , ” that “ Lachlan ’ s conservatism is more vigorous than that of any Australian politician ” and that his view were usually to the right of his father ’ s . Lachlan once presented himself at one of the family ’ s paper to express displeasure with it decision to run an editorial in support of same-sex marriage , according to three people who knew about the interaction at the time . ( Lachlan said through a representative that he had no recollection of the incident and that he support same-sex marriage . ) According to people close to him , Lachlan question what he see a the exorbitant cost of addressing climate change and belief that the debate over global warming is getting too much attention .
 Lachlan viewed his brother a a good executive , but he felt that he wa the one who had taken risk and proved himself in Australia . It wa true that some of his investment had failed — he ’ d bought a TV network , Ten , that went into receivership after losing $ 232 million in six month — but others , including a group of Top-100 and easy-listening radio station , were earning ten of million of dollar a year .
 Murdoch had been trying for year to coax Lachlan back from Australia . Murdoch ’ s 2013 divorce from his third wife , Wendi Murdoch , helped change Lachlan ’ s mind . He and James had tried to talk their father out of marrying Wendi over a 1999 dinner at the Manhattan restaurant Babbo — she wa the rare subject on which the two son agreed — and both of them had grown even le fond of her in the year that followed . James and at least one other company executive had heard from senior foreign official that they believed she wa a Chinese intelligence asset . And family member felt that she treated their father terribly , calling him “ old ” and “ stupid. ” ( A spokesman for Wendi Murdoch denied these claim . )
 Apart from Wendi , the son were at odds about almost everything . They were not only fighting over control of their father ’ s empire ; they were fighting over one of his home , a 8,651-square-foot Spanish-style mansion in Beverly Hills . Murdoch bought the house furnished in the 1980s from the music mogul Jules Stein , and his son had a sentimental attachment to it , having spent a lot of time there a child . According to six people close to the family , James and Lachlan were upset to learn that their father had put the house on the market and had a $ 35 million offer on it from Leonardo DiCaprio . The brother briefly discussed buying the house together ; whoever happened to be in L.A. at any given moment could use it . James finally agreed to buy the house himself at a discounted price of $ 30 million , though after he and Kathryn did so , they learned that it needed four new retaining wall , costing them million of dollar more . Lachlan wa upset that his brother had gotten the house . As a gift , Murdoch gave him some of the antique furniture inside , even though James and Kathryn thought they had bought it furnished .
 While James wa overseas , ready to quit , his father and brother came up with a compromise : All of 21st Century Fox ’ s division would report to both of them . James would be chief executive , while Lachlan would share the more exalted title of co-chairman with his father . The announcement would be carefully worded to suggest that they were coequals , to protect James from the public humiliation , even though Lachlan wa technically the senior executive . Their salary were identical , roughly $ 20 million a year to start . Each would have access to corporate plane for professional and personal use . James would be based in the company ’ s corporate office in Midtown Manhattan , Lachlan on the other side of the country , in the vast chairman ’ s office formerly occupied by his father in Building 88 on the 21st Century Fox lot , which he decorated with a picture of the Cavan ranch and a 1979 black-and-white photograph of Murdoch standing in front of a New York Post printing press .
 James warily agreed to the term , but the question of succession wa not fully resolved . The news coverage of their promotion made no distinction between the seniority of their respective position : Publicly at least , James wa still seen a the heir apparent . When the dust finally settled , the two son sat down for an interview with The Hollywood Reporter headlined , “ The New Age of Murdochs . ”
 Lachlan described the transition a “ seamless . ”
 In early 2015 , Murdoch got a call from Ivanka Trump , proposing lunch with her and her father .
 They met soon after in the corporate dining room of the Fox News building in Midtown Manhattan . Ivanka ’ s husband , Jared Kushner , came , too . Just a the first course wa being served , Trump told Murdoch that he wa going to run for president .
 Murdoch didn ’ t even look up from his soup , according to three people who independently shared the story . “ You have to be prepared to be rapped up badly , ” Murdoch replied , using an expression for taking some knock .
 Murdoch wa deeply entwined with the Trump family . Trump had aggressively cultivated The Post during his rise to celebrity in New York in the late ’ 70 and ’ 80 . Kushner became close to Murdoch after he purchased The New York Observer in 2006 . An improbable friendship blossomed between the octogenarian mogul and the 30-something publishing parvenu , with Murdoch and Wendi even taking Kushner and Ivanka on vacation in the Caribbean on Murdoch ’ s yacht . After Murdoch ’ s divorce in 2013 , Kushner , who wa also in the real estate business , helped him find a decorator for his new bachelor apartment . Ivanka wa one of five individual designated to oversee the trust for Murdoch and Wendi ’ s two daughter , which held $ 300 million in stock in News Corp and 21st Century Fox . ( She relinquished her role a a trustee in 2016 . )
 Murdoch recognized Trump ’ s appeal a a tabloid character and rating driver , but he did not see him a a serious person , let alone a credible candidate for president . “ He ’ s a [ expletive ] idiot , ” Murdoch would say when asked about Trump , three people close to him told u ( Through a spokeswoman , Murdoch denied that he ever used this phrase to describe Trump . ) .
 Roger Ailes , the longtime head of Fox News , wa no more generous , at least when Trump wa out of earshot . Ailes wa close to Trump , too : Their alliance dated back to Rudolph Giuliani ’ s 1989 New York mayoral campaign , for which Ailes worked a a medium adviser and Trump a a fund-raising figurehead . It wa Ailes who , in 2011 , gave Trump his regular Monday-morning slot on “ Fox & Friends , ” which Trump used to advance his “ birther ” campaign . Still , Ailes ranted indignantly about the notion of a Trump presidency , saying that he wasn ’ t remotely worthy of the Oval Office , a person close to him at the time told u .
 Fox News ’ s initial resistance to promoting his candidacy came a an unpleasant surprise to Trump , who had assumed that his relationship with Murdoch and Ailes would ensure positive coverage . Ailes had even written Trump an email asking what he could do to help him . ( After scrawling an enthusiastic note on top , Trump sent a printout of that email to his campaign manager , Corey Lewandowski . )
 During the campaign ’ s early month , it fell mostly to Ailes to manage the network ’ s tumultuous relationship with Trump , who complained constantly that Fox favored Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio . Trump wa driven into a near-weekly rage by the Fox News host Bret Baier ’ s Friday-night segment , “ Candidate Casino. ” Opening with a graphic of a spinning roulette wheel and Vegas-style light , Baier and his round table of political analyst would place bet on the probable party nominee . Even though Trump wa winning in most of the poll , Baier ’ s parlor of expert regularly placed him toward the bottom of the pack .
 It wa especially galling to Trump because he and Baier had golfed together , and Baier had briefly been a member at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach . ( Baier dropped his membership when it became clear that Trump wa likely to run for the presidency . ) After the Fox contributor and Weekly Standard editor Stephen F. Hayes called Trump “ a clown , ” Trump faxed Baier a copy of his résumé , with a note scrawled across it in black marker : “ Tell Hayes no clown could have done all this ! ” Trump even complained about Fox while appearing on Fox , ticking off , during a live interview with Sean Hannity , the contributor who should be fired because they were “ biased ” against him .
 Trump wasn ’ t without leverage in his relationship with Fox . The Murdoch formula wa to deliver the enthusiasm of reactionary reader and viewer to chosen candidate , but Trump wa already generating plenty of enthusiasm on his own . His hard-core supporter made up Fox ’ s core audience , and his social medium account gave him a direct connection to them . If these supporter had to choose between Trump and Fox , Ailes might not like the result . At the same time , a new crop of right-wing outlet — Breitbart , Gateway Pundit , One America News , Sinclair — were embracing his candidacy , and mainstream broadcaster were no le aware of what he could do for their rating . “ I can go on the ‘ Today ’ show in my pajama , and five million people will watch , ” he warned Ailes , a former Trump campaign official recalled .
 After the Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly asked Trump , during the first Republican primary debate in the summer of 2015 , to defend his comment about woman — “ You ’ ve called woman you don ’ t like fat pig , dog , slob and disgusting animal ” — Trump demanded that Ailes force her to publicly apologize , according to the former Trump campaign official . ( She didn ’ t . ) Six month later , on the eve of another Republican debate in Des Moines , which Trump wa boycotting because Kelly wa once again moderating , Ailes tried desperately to persuade Trump to change his mind . His hope were dashed when Trump called him from the tarmac in Iowa to refuse , having just watched the Fox News contributor Charles Krauthammer mock him on the network . Without Trump , the event drew just half the viewership of Fox ’ s first debate .
 Kushner wa privately lobbying Murdoch to reconsider his attitude toward his father-in-law , showing him video of the candidate ’ s overflowing campaign rally on his iPhone . Even a Trump gained momentum , Murdoch continued to look for alternative . Over the summer of 2015 , he wrote a personal check for $ 200,000 to the super PAC of Gov . John Kasich , the relatively moderate Republican from Ohio , according to Federal Election Commission filing .
 Aware of her father-in-law ’ s dim view of Trump , James ’ s wife , Kathryn , tried to broker a meeting between Murdoch and Hillary Clinton . Having worked for the Clinton Climate Initiative , she knew both the Clintons and their inner circle of adviser and hoped Murdoch might consider an endorsement , or at least commit to staying neutral . The idea wa not so far-fetched . Murdoch had , after all , backed Tony Blair , a Clinton-style Labor Party centrist , and had once even hosted a Senate fund-raiser for Hillary . Murdoch felt he didn ’ t need his daughter-in-law ’ s help . In fact , he called Clinton personally , leaving a message at her campaign headquarters . Clinton called back almost immediately but declined his invitation to meet with him . ( A spokesman for Clinton did not respond to a request for comment . )
 During the primary , Trump honed his political identity , railing against military intervention , free trade and immigration . They were all position that directly contradicted Murdoch ’ s own , more neoconservative view . Murdoch had enthusiastically supported the Iraq War , evangelized for open immigration policy — even urging Australia to avoid the “ self defeating ” anti-immigration debate in the United States — and endorsed international trade agreement like the Trans-Pacific Partnership . His attitude toward Trump ’ s emergent ideology wa often captured on the unremittingly anti-Trump editorial page of The Wall Street Journal . The page ’ s editor , Paul Gigot , wa in frequent contact with his paper ’ s owner , according to source familiar with the conversation . And yet Murdoch wa in a sense responsible for unleashing the force that were now propelling Trump ’ s rise . During the Obama year , Fox News had found rating and profit with it wall-to-wall coverage of raucous Tea Party rally and the opinion show that advanced the campaign to delegitimize the country ’ s first African-American president . As the Republican nominating process progressed , this populist , anti-establishment energy wa unmistakably coalescing around Trump .
 By March 2016 , Donald Trump , the man Murdoch had so quickly dismissed a year earlier , wa now the clear front-runner , and Murdoch wa taking his first tentative step toward embracing him .
 “ If he becomes inevitable , party would be mad not to unify , ” he tweeted .
 Across the Atlantic , a similar right-wing wave wa threatening to drive Britain out of the European Union . Murdoch had a hand in that a well . His most influential tabloid , The Sun , had long been advocating for an exit from the E.U. , and so had Murdoch himself , distilling his opposition to the E.U . into a single quote to Anthony Hilton , a columnist at The Evening Standard : “ When I go into Downing Street , they do what I say ; when I go to Brussels , they take no notice. ” ( Murdoch subsequently denied saying this ; Hilton stood by the quote . ) Prime Minister John Major told a judicial inquiry that in 1997 Murdoch said that he could not support him if he didn ’ t change his stance toward Europe , which the prime minister took a a demand for an E.U . referendum . ( Murdoch denied this , too . ) As the summer of 2016 approached , that referendum wa finally coming .
 The idea of Britain ’ s splitting from the E.U . had always seemed more like a nativist fever dream than a realistic political goal . But in 2016 , Brexit proponent could scan the globe and see cause for optimism . Not only wa Trump ’ s campaign surging in the United States , but reactionary nationalism wa also gaining supporter worldwide : In Austria ’ s presidential election , the candidate of the Freedom Party , founded by former Nazi officer , narrowly lost in a runoff . The Philippines had just elected a president Rodrigo Duterte , following a campaign during which he inveighed against the country ’ s business and political elite and promised to kill so many criminal that the fish in Manila Bay would “ grow fat ” from feeding on their dead body . Hungary ’ s prime minister , Viktor Orban , had already built his own version of a border wall , mile of barbed wire aimed at turning back what he later called “ Muslim invader . ”
 In the week leading up to the vote , The Sun led the London tabloid in hammering the case for leaving the European Union . It cast Brexit a a choice between the “ arrogant europhiles ” and the country ’ s working class , while railing against “ mass immigration which keep wage low and put catastrophic pressure on our school , hospital , road and housing stock. ” It still looked like a long shot , and Murdoch ’ s other British newspaper , the more sober Times , had encouraged it wealthier and more politically moderate reader to vote in favor of remaining in the European Union . But The Sun wa where Murdoch ’ s heart — and influence — lay .
 How much influence he still wielded in British politics wa an open question . Murdoch had effectively been chased out of London five year earlier in the wake of the biggest crisis of his career : the revelation that his News of the World tabloid had , in search of dirt , been systematically hacking into the phone of politician , celebrity , royal and even a 13-year-old schoolgirl . The scandal that followed , itself fit for tabloid headline , would permanently alter the course of both the family and it empire . One of Murdoch ’ s executive , Rebekah Brooks , a virtual seventh child to Murdoch , wa arrested , tried and acquitted . Andy Coulson , a former Murdoch editor who had gone to work for Prime Minister David Cameron , wa sent to prison for encouraging his reporter to engage in illegal practice . In a futile effort at damage control , the company spent million of dollar settling claim from hacking victim . Murdoch and James , who wa running the company ’ s European and Asian operation from London at the time , were grilled in a public hearing before Parliament . James denied knowing that the phone-hacking wa widespread but wa publicly confronted with an email he wa sent in 2008 alerting him to the potential severity of the problem . ( He said that he had not reviewed “ the full email chain . ” )
 It wa a corporate scandal , but because of the nature of this corporation , it wa also a family matter . James blamed his father for having allowed the freebooting , anything-goes culture to take root at the paper and for forcing him to absorb so much of the blame for the scandal , when the hacking itself took place before he took charge . As James saw it , his father wa angry that he wouldn ’ t conduct a cover-up ; James went so far a to tell some member of the board that he wa concerned about Murdoch ’ s mental health . For his part , Murdoch blamed James for surrounding himself with feckless , sycophantic adviser who failed to neutralize the crisis when it still could have been contained . Elisabeth , having long been out of the succession mix , reinserted herself , urging her father to fire James and replace him with her , four people familiar with the conversation told u . ( Through a spokesperson , Elisabeth denied that she encouraged her brother ’ s firing or asked for his job . ) Murdoch agreed to fire James but reversed his decision before it became public . Lachlan used the opportunity to play the family savior in a time of crisis , calling his father from Bangkok — en route to Britain from Australia — to urge him not to do anything rash . He swept into the company ’ s London office looking tan , fit and rested , despite the daylong flight from Australia . His presence appeared to be an instant comfort to his father .
 The public shaming did not end with the scandal — a worldwide news event for month — or the interrogation by Parliament . A judicial inquiry investigated the practice of the British press , with Murdoch ’ s paper front and center . The resulting document , the Leveson Report , depicted a country in which a single family had amassed so much power that it had come to feel that the rule did not apply to them . “ Sometimes the very greatest power is exercised without having to ask , ” the report said . In their discussion with Murdoch , “ politician knew that the prize wa personal and political support in his mass-circulation newspaper . ”
 By the time the Leveson Report wa released in 2012 , Murdoch had shut down The News of the World and wa keeping a low profile in Britain . Several factor accounted for his return in 2016 , including his recent marriage to his fourth wife , Jerry Hall . They met in Australia , where Hall wa playing Mrs. Robinson in a stage adaptation of “ The Graduate. ” Hall had a teenage son in London , and she and Murdoch were spending a lot of time in the 26-room house that she owned with her former partner , Mick Jagger .
 Now back in the city where he once wooed Margaret Thatcher , Murdoch used Britain ’ s largest tabloid to rally reader to vote to leave the European Union . The Sun ’ s cover on the day of the Brexit referendum wa a picture of corporate synergy : “ Independence Day : Britain ’ s Resurgence , ” it read , over a mock version of the poster for the 21st Century Fox movie “ Independence Day : Resurgence , ” which opened in Britain that day . Murdoch flew in to London from Cannes for the vote and soon visited the newsroom of the anti-Brexit Times to gloat , joking to his reporter about their glum face . Later , he likened the country ’ s decision to leave the European Union to “ a prison break ” and celebrated the vote with Nigel Farage , a leading architect of Brexit ( and a future Fox News contributor ) , at a garden party at the London mansion of the Russian oligarch Evgeny Lebedev .
 The referendum represented the realization of a long-deferred dream for Murdoch . But it also returned him to a position of influence in British politics that seemed inconceivable just a few year earlier . Not only had The Sun played a critical role in delivering the Brexit vote , but in the ensuing political upheaval , it had swung behind Theresa May , helping ensure her election a prime minister . Once in office , she found time for a private meeting with Murdoch on one of her first foreign trip : a less-than-36-hour visit to New York to address the United Nations .
 Days after the vote , Trump , who had seemed to be struggling with the basic principle of Brexit in an interview with The Sun a few week earlier , visited Scotland for a victory lap of his own : “ I said this wa going to happen , and I think that it ’ s a great thing. ” He , too , found time for Murdoch , inviting him and Jerry Hall to dinner with Kushner and Ivanka at his golf course in Aberdeen . Photographers captured them riding off in a golf cart , with Trump at the wheel and Murdoch lounging in the back .
 The summer of 2016 wa a good time to be a network with a dedicated audience of right-wing viewer . And yet the future of Fox News had never seemed more uncertain : Murdoch ’ s flagship network wa now backing a Republican presidential nominee who not only represented a radical departure from the party ’ s traditional platform but who also seemed destined to lose in a few month . What ’ s more , that network ’ s lodestar , Roger Ailes , had just been forced out following multiple claim of sexual harassment .
 It wa James and Lachlan who teamed up to push Ailes out , over the initial objection of their father . Ailes wa another rare subject on which the two son agreed , though they disliked him for different reason . Lachlan had clashed repeatedly with Ailes early in his career in New York . He told friend that he reached his breaking point with his father in 2005 when he learned that Murdoch had said to Ailes , “ Don ’ t worry about the boy. ” For his part , James saw Ailes a a boorish showman who embodied many of the most retrograde impulse of the network ’ s opinion programming : it nativism ; it paranoiac attitude toward Muslims and undocumented immigrant ; it embrace of conspiracy ; and , maybe most of all , it climate-change denialism .
 James saw in Ailes ’ s exit an opportunity to push the network in a new direction . He wanted to bring in an experienced news executive who would reposition it a a more responsible , if still conservative , outlet — one whose host would no longer be free to vent without adhering to basic standard of accuracy , fairness and , a he saw it , decency . One candidate he had in mind wa David Rhodes . Then the president of CBS News , Rhodes wa a former Fox News executive , a well a the brother of Ben Rhodes , a foreign-policy adviser for Obama . Both Murdoch and Lachlan dismissed the idea . They wanted continuity , not change . Like his father , Lachlan considered the idea of meddling with such an important profit driver a form of madness .
 Rather than replace Ailes with a new executive , Murdoch moved into his office and took over the job himself , a short-term solution intended to reassure both shareholder and talent . He wa soon back in the newsroom , attending meeting and visiting set — “ my retirement job , ” he called it — and wa having more fun than he ’ d had in year .
 Having once dismissed Trump ’ s candidacy , Murdoch now threw himself wholly behind it . During the final stretch of the campaign , Fox cut back appearance by anti-Trump analyst and contributor and added pro-Trump one , while also ramping up it attack on Hillary Clinton . Sean Hannity built show around the same sort of false claim that were circulating on far-right internet site and suspected Russian social medium account , suggesting that Clinton wa suffering from a possibly life-threatening illness and that one of her Secret Service agent wa carrying a diazepam pen , which is commonly used to treat seizure . ( It wa actually a flashlight . ) One anti-Clinton segment wa built around an appearance by Jeff Rovin , who had for year been the editor in chief of The Weekly World News , the supermarket tabloid best known for claiming that Hillary Clinton wa possessed by Satan and had carried on an affair with a space alien named P ’ Lod . Other Murdoch outlet were swinging behind Trump , too : At The Wall Street Journal ’ s editorial page , Trump critic felt increasing pressure to moderate their position . ( The Journal ’ s news side , by contrast , broke the first story about The National Enquirer ’ s role in Trump ’ s effort to buy the silence of woman claiming affair with him . )
 With Clinton taking on an air of inevitability , James and Kathryn invited Kushner and Ivanka to a small dinner salon they were hosting at their Upper East Side townhouse with a guest speaker : Adm. James Stavridis , a Democrat who had been talked about a a possible vice-presidential pick for Clinton . James and Kathryn knew Kushner and Ivanka socially and considered the invitation a gesture of empathy , a person who attended the dinner told u . They had endured their own public humiliation during the hacking scandal in London and wanted to show solidarity with the couple , and they also let them know that they would be welcomed back into polite Manhattan society after Trump lost .
 As the early return came in on election night , Kathryn received a text message from her father-in-law , who wa in the Fox newsroom : “ Looks like your girl ’ s going to win . ”

 It usually take a while — a decade or two — before we can look back at a particular era of American life and see it a something coherent , something whose every aspect is marked by one overarching mood . It take a certain amount of hindsight to notice how all the wildly different reaction people had to the moment were still , in the end , reaction to the same thing ; all the different pose they adopted were still being struck against the same backdrop .
 But this era — this year , and the last one , and one or two before that — might be an exception . There ’ s an oddly strong in-the-moment consensus on how everyone is feeling these day , and it is not good . At some point it became a routine conversational tic for all sort of people , of all sort of persuasion , to express , with an incredulous gesture , that thing feel a bit grueling and frantic lately , don ’ t they ? Musicians are no exception . “ Life is pretty tumultuous right now for all of u , ” said the crossover country star Kacey Musgraves , while accepting a Grammy for the Album of the Year . The Swedish singer Robyn acknowledges that “ pop at the moment is depressing ” in an interview midway through this issue . “ The music kid are listening to is heavy ! Maybe it ’ s hard to be positive and optimistic at the moment . ”
 What ’ s amazing is that the musical expression of all this isn ’ t always some big swing toward darkness , or anger , or anxiety . ( Though there is , in certain genre , plenty of all that a well . ) Read through this list , and what you ’ ll often see instead is a very earnest , very serious desire to find the right reaction to a world that feel tense and high-stakes — an ambient conviction that music should be looking for way to cope , way to protect ourselves , moment of escape , hard reckoning with our collective responsibility , idea for how to make the world feel le brutal . The 25 song and artist below include blockbuster hit , critical darling and inescapable conversation piece , but few of them take a direct route to the usual joy of pop — the song about dancing and boasting and sex and love , the one about what a fantastic night everyone ’ s about to have or what ecstasy they intend to find by the end of it . No , a lot of these song seem focused on deeper challenge : How do we get to those joy in the first place ? Who get to have them , and who deserves them ? And in one case : Which of them are worth the corresponding rise in sea level ?
 The artist do not always sound thrilled about the circumstance . ( “ The society we live in at the moment , ” Robyn say — “ we didn ’ t really make it very good , you know ? ” ) But they ’ re a lot more motivated — whether it ’ s to articulate something bleak or find their way toward something better — than you might expect .

 How aging — and the age — can change a song ’ s meaning .
 By HANIF ABDURRAQIB
 I don ’ t know if Bruce Springsteen think about death a much a I think about the inevitability of his dying . I ’ ve lived an entire life a a fan of Bruce Springsteen , which mean I have already imagined the world without him in it , and I have mourned that world . If you ’ re lucky enough to age gracefully beyond a certain point , with that aging will come an acceptance of finality or of the idea that there is going to be a darkness from which you can ’ t return . If you ’ re lucky enough to have made a life writing song or story or something at the intersection of song and story , this could mean that there come a point where you make sure people hear you clearly , one last time , before you go .
 I don ’ t know if Springsteen himself think about his life and death in this way , but the silence in “ Springsteen on Broadway ” — which ran on Broadway from Oct. 3 , 2017 , to Dec. 15 , 2018 , culminating in a soundtrack and a Netflix special — suggest he might . The space he built in between the song allow the artist to explain and give context not to just the music but also to the life built around the music . If the project of Springsteen ’ s Broadway show wa to attach history and legacy to the individual song long adored by the public , there is also something to be said about what time doe to natural storyteller . They can become more tactile with age , drawing out story that have been told several time before the most current retelling — leaving a listener with even more touchable moment than otherwise might have been asked for or sought , so that when the storyteller is long gone , there might still be fragment of his or her story that span generation .
 Of the many gripping example of this in “ Springsteen on Broadway , ” the one that stand out most memorably is the sprawling story he tell before playing his iconic ( and often misconstrued song ) “ Born in the U.S.A. ” The story center on Walter Cichon , who wa the frontman for the Motifs , a band Springsteen still considers one of the best rock ’ n ’ roll band from the Jersey Shore . In the ’ 60 , the Motifs played weekend show to room packed with teenage admirer . Cichon wore his hair long and sported pointy black boot . When he performed , he would shake out his hair and send bead of sweat flying past the stage light . For anyone who ha ever lived in any town where a band wa on the verge of “ making it , ” you know the epiphany : This band is too good to be here , in this place , in this moment . That wa the Motifs , with their frantic and warbly guitar laid below Cichon ’ s howling vocal .
 Walter Cichon wa drafted when he wa 21 and didn ’ t come back from Vietnam . He went missing in action in 1968 .
 On Broadway , Bruce Springsteen performs “ Born in the U.S.A. ” largely in silence . The song is half-spoken , half-sung , Springsteen ’ s voice rough and breaking beneath the decade of labor it ha done — labor rendered romantic through writing and performance . What ha always been true about the career of Bruce Springsteen is that he ’ s most entertaining when backed by his pal , but he ’ s most earnest when he ’ s alone . To hear “ Born in the U.S.A. ” presented without an instrument is to hear the strain that push toward the edge of anger , that hovering sentiment that wa lost in the original ’ s bombastic wall of sound and perhaps camouflaged by it imagery . At the time of the song ’ s release , Springsteen wa a young , attractive , muscular man who appeared midjump in front of an American flag on the single ’ s cover . From a zoomed-out perspective — a white musician writing about the intricacy of labor — it could seem a if he represented everything that a particular America would be proud of . The misreading of the original song wa not purely accidental : Its volume and fanfare meant that it sounded ( and still sound ) good bursting out of speaker while firework explode in the sky , and it loudest word in the chorus are about land and birthright . But with the drum and burst of keyboard gone , the relentlessly hollow hope of the song is gone , too . On the isolated stage of a theater , all that ’ s left is knowing that the singer ha loved and dreamed and lost in a country sometimes not worth loving and dreaming and losing in .
 In his long monologue introducing “ Born in the U.S.A. ” on Broadway , Springsteen talk about “ the blood and the confusion and the pride and the shame and the grace that come with birthplace , ” and I get it . There are some of u who didn ’ t ask to be born in our particular here , and there are some of u who didn ’ t ask to come to this particular here , but to be in wherever your here is mean that you might be compelled to both fight for it and forgive it . On Broadway , Springsteen mention something else : He tell the story of him and two of his friend being summoned to the selective-service office , a a prelude to being sent to Vietnam — for what , he say , “ we were sure wa going to be our funeral. ” They did everything they could to get out of being drafted , and succeeded . He end the story by exhaling softly and pausing before telling the audience : “ I do sometimes wonder who went in my place . Because somebody did . ”
 I imagine that ’ s it . To live a long enough life in a place founded , in part , on violence and volatility is to know that long life may depend on someone else walking through a door you wanted no part of . Or to know that the hero from your hometown never made it out because war got to them first . Stripped to it barest bone , “ Born in the U.S.A. ” asks a listener to recognize that human survival is not something we can count on . The song matter now in a different way than it did in 1984 , largely because of the artist behind it : Springsteen , trying to wrestle not only with the song ’ s current legacy but also with how it might be co-opted decade from now , when he won ’ t be around to make sure people understand the ache behind the song ’ s fury .

 The Ambiguous kiss-off .
 By AMANDA HESS
 ‘ Thank u , next ” is styled like a tweet , which is how the phrase first appeared — a a cryptic rebuke that Ariana Grande thumbed off in the comedian Pete Davidson ’ s general direction a few day after their breakup . Since then , the phrase ha pulsed through the culture , undulating between naughty and nice . When the song debuted , it wa revealed to be not a takedown but instead a sincere tribute to relationship past , lifting Davidson ( “ for Pete , I ’ m so thankful ” ) to the same plane a her ex Mac Miller , the rapper who died of a drug overdose last year ( “ he wa an angel ” ) . But then the video hit , and in it , Grande cosplayed a Regina George , the demon Barbie of “ Mean Girls , ” scrawling note about her ex in a burn book . But then all the thing she wrote about them were really nice ! A quick shot in the video show the apology she scrawled on Davidson ’ s page — “ sry i dipped ” — which wa secretly the most savage note of all : For the record , she dumped him .
 Online , the phrase ha bloomed into a deliciously ambiguous kiss-off , a usage modeled by Grande herself , directed toward anyone from a no-name rapper who covered the song to Piers Morgan , who criticized pop star for appearing in revealing photo shoot . Like the Southern “ bless your heart , ” the passive-aggressive nicety that sustain the entire Midwest or the chill of the British stiff upper lip , the internet ha found a discreet slight of it own in “ thank u , next . ”
 The phrase is breezily transactional . It render news anchor and ex-boyfriend into stranger , reducing them to the base level of politeness required by the social contract . It sharpens respect into a shiv . And yet it is vexing in it restraint , pre-emptively silencing any retaliatory effort .
 We are living in a time of great pettiness . A big star can grow two size by doing something very small . Bhad Bhabie chucked a drink at Iggy Azalea and cemented her status a a memetic folk hero . Pusha T lobbed a literal baby into the middle of his rap war with Drake . Grande ’ s grace could , in one reading , signal a rejection of all of this calculated cruelty , a classy subversion of the fan-and-industry expectation that a celebrity may only rise by tearing another down .
 But it ’ s also a savvy strategy for advancing the game . The next level of beef is always the high road — ascending to that rarefied realm of conflict where put-down are joined seamlessly with self-respect . In “ thank u , next , ” Grande cast her ex a steppingstones on her path to greatness , men who taught her “ patience , ” “ pain ” and , ultimately , how little she needed them . There ’ s nothing harsher than having your relationship converted into a learning experience . And the worst part is , you know she ’ s right . The secret message of “ thank u , next ” is that woman can dismiss men who sap their energy and undermine their success , and this is not an act of cruelty or a symptom of bitchiness . It ’ s a simple social nicety .

 The new R. & B . litmus test requires artist to be accessible , enigmatic and maybe a little bit flawed . Sanging is optional .
 By ANGELA FLOURNOY
 From the vocal singularity embodied in Aretha Franklin to the otherworldly dance move of Michael Jackson , black folk have long expected rigor from our R. & B . entertainer . ( We institutionalized this expectation at the Apollo Theater , where , on Amateur Night , an “ executioner ” used to chase away mediocre performer midact with a broom or a pitchfork ; now he just dance them off the stage . ) Being the best in R. & B . meant that you had a honed , real-deal ability to entertain , that you could stand on a stage and perform a remarkable act that separated you from the rest of u .
 I grew up hearing debate about the worthiness of this or that singer devolve into shouting match , the assertion that a favored artist could sing but not really sang being an affront to your system of taste and judgment . Mariah Carey wa always an easy win . In a single verse , her melismatic contralto might argue with her teasing falsetto , alternating between lower and higher note until she sounded more bird than human . In the ’ 90 , girl-next-door Mariah belted out uptempo love song on one station ; a few turn of the dial over , she sang the same record with the addition of a hip-hop verse , thereby sliding from mainstream to “ urban , ” which is to say from white to black . She straddled two coded world a a biracial person , a sometimes-fraught experience that she addressed on her 1997 song “ Outside . ”
 Her desire for cross-genre acceptance is part of what pushed her to write and arrange song for herself that few other human being could cover . Through the mid-2000s , to listen to a Mariah album , from lead single to deep cut , wa to marvel at a maximalist pulling off her excess , every run more dazzling than the last . And yet by the end of the aught , she had begun receding behind her production , talk-singing and whispering where she used to overaccentuate each phrase . The rumored loss of her voice seemed to mark the end of an era altogether .
 Few people argue over the voice of a singer the way they used to , but R. & B . is back in vogue after having spent several year in the background a E.D.M . dictated pop ’ s music imperative . Younger artist are pushing the genre forward in many respect : intriguing , pared-down personal style ( SZA ) ; forceful , nuanced messaging ( Solange ) ; swaggering vocal that don ’ t feel yoked to the rap feature ( H.E.R . ) ; and a much-needed expansion of whom a woman might be singing love song to in the first place ( Syd ) . But the term by which we expect rigor from these artist have changed , too . A voice that sound a though it were gifted from the heaven is no longer a likely predictor of critical success , though it may garner you a stint on “ The Voice. ” More important is appearing unvarnished , or idiosyncratic . Contemporary R. & B . seems to prefer the D.I.Y . ethos of indie rock or riffing on the earthy , unadorned feel of neo-soul . The preferred feel is that of a raw outpouring of emotion alone in a bedroom with a laptop . To see R. & B. ’ s newest name perform at event like the Grammys is a bit like seeing your high school gym teacher on a date — who even knew they owned fancy clothes ?
 Mariah Carey doesn ’ t seem built for this new R. & B . moment , but “ A No No , ” from her 2018 album “ Caution , ” work for all the reason we would once expect it not to . It ’ s a straightforward sample of an extremely familiar song ( a remix of Lil ’ Kim ’ s 1997 “ Crush on You ” ) . Vocally , it ’ s uncomplicated . The track ha a few elastic moment at the top of verse , but for the most part , Carey maintains a syncopated , crooning sing-speak . She come down from the vocal stratosphere to some place closer to the younger R. & B . chanteuses , but it never feel like a cop-out . “ Caution ” a a whole forgoes Carey ’ s hallmark vocal pyrotechnic , save for a few whistle tone that creep into the final note of several track . What make it different from her previous attempt at le ornate vocal arrangement is the confidence Carey exudes . She isn ’ t hiding ; she ’ s recalibrating .
 This new phase of R. & B . is one for which Mariah the songwriter is well suited . She ha always been a quick study of current trend , and a a writer on 17 of her 18 No.1 single , she proved that she knew how to make her voice fit within them . Carey posse a mischievous sense of humor ( best employed on Eminem dis track ) that is fit for our current age of trolling and lyric made for meme . In “ A No No ” she drawl out the line “ Irregardless of what transpired , ” daring the listener to think too hard about whether she know that she ha deployed a fake word ( of course she doe ) . Over the past three decade , Mariah the vocalist ha been so singular that other Mariahs went overlooked — the canny recognizer of trend , the pop star who pushed her label to make unlikely hip-hop collaboration happen and the songwriter who wa funnier than people understood . Mariah , queen of glitter and lover of glamour , might never pull off a down-to-earth visual aesthetic , but she still posse the tool to make music that embodies that feeling — and she ha had these tool for year .

 He ’ s been rapping about it for year . Now a lot more people are listening .
 Interview by NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES
 Last year , in a span of month , Meek Mill went from solitary confinement in a Pennsylvania prison to releasing an album that debuted at No.1 on the Billboard chart . It ’ s a paradoxical narrative that ha defined the Philadelphia rapper since his teenage year , when he landed both a record deal and criminal conviction on drug and gun charge . Sentenced at 21 to prison and year of probation , the 31-year-old rapper ha spent his entire adult life in and out of court and prison , often for noncriminal violation like not adequately reporting his travel plan .
 But 2018 proved transformative . New scrutiny of the judge overseeing his probation , and of the initial case — he ha always maintained that the police made up charge — roused public support from powerful people , including Jay-Z , Philadelphia ’ s district attorney and the Philadelphia 76ers co-owner Michael Rubin . With tour date for his “ Championships ” album selling out , Mill ha become a leading voice on the failing of the criminal-justice system . Along with writing an op-ed for The New York Times and appearing on national news show , the rapper helped start the Reform Alliance , an organization dedicated to getting one million Americans out of the prison system .
 How long did you work on the album ? Probably eight month . Since I came out .
 I usually take about eight month to produce a piece a well . Then there ’ s panic — you ’ ve gone over it so many time , you can ’ t even tell anymore if it ’ s good or not . I feel the same way . Going through the music so much , not even knowing if it ’ s good anymore — I done heard it at least a thousand time , trying to analyze and look at it so many way .
 At the end of “ Championships , ” you say we had to beat the street , beat racism , beat poverty . So much of what you write is sociological , a study of the neighborhood . Your being from Philadelphia made me think about W.E.B . Du Bois in 1899 — he did a study called “ The Philadelphia Negro. ” Yeah , I read piece of it in prison . One of the older guy probably gave it to me .
 Then you know what I ’ m talking about . This wa known a the first sociological study of black Americans in the country . He wa trying to understand why black folk lived the way they lived . And the social problem he identified — poverty , crime , illiteracy , white discrimination — are the exact same thing you talk about 120 year later . That wa my life coming up , so it wa normal . I always tell people , I ’ ve been living the life I ’ m living now for the last eight year , but I ’ ve been living in the ghetto for 23 . Things we ’ ve been traumatized by our whole life — we have a right to talk about it .
 You refer to school a couple of time on this album — your mom praying you ’ d go to Yale , or going to a school with bullet hole in the locker . You said you were on the honor roll ? I used to be , until , like , third grade . There wa another book I got in prison , about black kid — the fourth grade , thing go wrong and grade start to decline . That wa my life . Mine wa because I moved to a different neighborhood , rougher than the one I came from .
 One of my favorite quote from James Baldwin is “ The kid had been told that they weren ’ t worth [ expletive ] , and everything they saw around them proved it. ” What did your school say about what society thought of you ? We used to have teacher say , “ Oh , you ’ re probably going to be dead or in jail , or you ’ re probably going to be a failure. ” I had some good teacher , too , but it wa rough in our school .
 I feel like that ’ s a message we start telling black boy very early : You ’ re going to be dead or in jail . I know we ’ re trying to warn them , but it also seems a if you ’ re dictating their future . Yeah , but I never believed that . I used to say I wa going to be a normal story of the ghetto . But if you have your mom telling you you ’ re going to be a great person and then your teacher talk to you like that — you wouldn ’ t really want to listen to that person anymore .
 Was school easy for you ? Pretty easy . I didn ’ t have to study to pas my test . Even if I ran the hallway , I would still be fairly good . Later on , when I really stopped trying , I wa put in disciplinary school . It wa like a jail . You get strip-searched before you go in , fingerprinted every day . One day I just climbed over the gate and left .
 It wa a public school organized like a jail ? In other word , it wa early conditioning for what everybody assumed your future wa going to be . When I finally went to jail , I already knew everybody . Everybody I went to school with wa in the jail .
 What were you put in that school for ? Fighting and acting up . I said in one of my rap , I wa acting up in school because I thought it wa cool , but really I wa hurt . Your mom ’ s at work , your dad ’ s in the graveyard , you ’ re not really getting nurtured , and I guess you just resort to acting up .
 You have a song called “ Trauma , ” which talk about that , the PTSD young people in these neighborhood are dealing with . But that ’ s why I love that Baldwin quote — everything about the environment tell these kid they ’ re nothing , right ? But when they react in what ’ s actually a very normal way , we want to break them down . You don ’ t value yourself because you grow up not being valued . What type of motivation do you get if your mom is on drug ? Your self-esteem is automatically just low . Some people have the determination to shoot to the top . But , you know , that ’ s not normal — for just a regular kid to have the determination to do that .
 I always say anger is an easier emotion to deal with than pain . Yeah . That ’ s why I say , you come through neighborhood and you see kid with their face all balled up or looking angry ? They ’ re probably really angry . His mom is probably really on drug , and he probably really don ’ t have food in the house , and his dad is probably really dead . They hurt , they torn , they scarred . It ’ s nothing that word can really fix . “ Why is this kid always angry ? ” Well , he ’ s been through something .
 Who ’ s the first black writer you ever read ? I ’ d never be able to determine who wa black and white when I wa reading back then . I don ’ t know the first . “ The New Jim Crow ” — that ’ s a black writer ?
 Yes . Michelle Alexander . When you were in high school , you weren ’ t exposed to black literature , black writer ? I went to public school . The book were falling apart . They probably still got the same book from when I wa in school . We didn ’ t get no black literature in public school .
 I read a lot a a child , mostly because I wa grounded all the time . Then we had a black-studies course in high school , and I became obsessed with black history because it felt like , for the first time , the world made sense . You would see your community and how people lived , and they would tell you we just did not want better . But I could see how hard people worked , and they still could not get ahead . Studying history calmed me . The most I ever read wa in prison . There ’ s nothing to do , so you turn to book . Reading made me process the system . Sometimes I thought it wa just million of black people , and Spanish — when you come to prison , it ’ s black and Spanish . Looking deeper , and seeing the way some of those thing are broken down in “ The New Jim Crow , ” it made me really wonder . Because I am already a conspiracy theorist .
 I don ’ t understand how you can be black and not be a conspiracy theorist . I wa doing a show on CNN , and a guy wa like , “ Why are you saying the system is similar to slavery ? ” It kind of caught me off guard , and I couldn ’ t really answer . But you ’ ve got people working for eight cent in here . You ’ re feeding people the [ expletive ] you would feed slave . You ’ ve got people cuffed up , shackled from top to bottom . People locked in the basement for 23 hour a day , being beat by the officer . It ’ s basically the same . And one of the amendment say that when you ’ re under custody of the government , you can be treated like a slave .
 Yes , the 13th . So you were first arrested — for the original charge — at 19 ? My first arrest wa actually going to school . In sixth or seventh grade . I wa suspended , and I didn ’ t want to tell my mom , so I tried to hang out in the hallway . I got caught and went to jail for trespassing . My mom had to come get me .
 What ’ s the charge you ’ re still on probation for ? Selling crack . This is to my dad ’ s soul : I wasn ’ t selling crack when they locked me up for it . When I got back , I had to get back in the street and start really selling weed to get me a lawyer , because everyone who had a public defender got crucified . My mug shot ha my face swollen , both side of my face beat up . I wa charged with fracturing the cop ’ s hand . You know how his hand got fractured ?
 Yeah , punching you . Yeah . He charged me for him punching my face . They said I pointed a gun at them . If somebody can sit there and tell you the story of how they didn ’ t point a gun at cop , nine time out of 10 , it ’ s true . It ’ s not too many people who can make it out of pointing a gun at a couple cop .
 I remember one time , this judge said , “ I don ’ t give people three to six month ; I give people three to six year ” — for something like a first-time weed charge . That always stuck with me . That ’ s not O.K . I mean , you can ’ t shoot nobody and expect to be getting chance . But if you were on probation and began smoking weed ? People in the ’ hood are going through real [ expletive ] . I barely sleep from so much trauma . Sometimes you just want to smoke and go to sleep .
 And you ’ ve got to think about it — you ’ ve got 18- , 19-year-old kid , sending them to a whole building full of rapist , killer . They put you in a cell with a 45-year-old man who got a life sentence , who ’ s a killer . This is your dad right here . He ’ s going to raise you . He ’ s going to show you how to clean the toilet , how to carry yourself . They ’ re not thinking about that . They ’ re just giving this guy three year to get taught this mentality .
 My mom wa a probation officer . She would tell me how certain officer would wait outside the person ’ s house , trying to catch them . And it ’ s for noncriminal thing , right ? The average person , I think , belief that people are being violated because they ’ re doing criminal activity . But I ’ ve had family and friend incarcerated , and part of their probation would be that they couldn ’ t drive . In a place with no public transit , they would drive to work and get violated . You can ’ t associate with known felon , but that mean you can ’ t be around your family member or go to the barbershop . You can ’ t associate with felon when you just came from prison , with a thousand felon in your face every day . That make no sense . One time the judge wa like , “ This is lenient , ” and in my head — I couldn ’ t say this — I wa like , Who are you to even say this is lenient ? If you gave me three month , that is not lenient . I ’ m going to lose my job , lose the lease on my house . She made it a condition that I couldn ’ t even rap .
 In prison , you were 23-and-1 , right ? Isolated all but one hour a day ? I can ’ t even imagine what that ’ s like . Nobody can . I wa just talking to 21 Savage in prison , and I wa like , This is the closest you ’ ve ever been to God in a room like this . The last time I wa on 23-and-1 , my lawyer came to see me , and I wa like , “ Did I go crazy and just don ’ t know I went crazy ? ” I started writing everything I wa feeling , but when I went back and looked at it , I wa spelling everything wrong , thing I know how to spell . I kept blacking out in the middle of the day — not passing out , but like falling asleep . I wa counting the bird on the wire : This bird ’ s gon na fly off in 10 , 9 , 8 , 7 . The bird don ’ t fly off , start over . Twenty-three and a half hour a day . Come out to take a shower , back to your cell . And I wasn ’ t in there for punishment — they had me on a mental block because I ’ m a celebrity , and they didn ’ t have anywhere to put me . Every time I got out , I ’ m like , yeah , I ’ m not the same no more .
 You ’ ve become the face of criminal-justice problem . When did you realize that you had a platform , and that you should use it to advocate for more than yourself ? When I saw the support people gave me . Everybody wa saying “ Free Meek , ” but it wa really like saying “ Free everybody who go through these conditions. ” It surprised me , because I ’ ve been in and out of prison for these type of thing for the past 11 year , and people were just like : “ Aw , he ’ s stupid . He keep going to jail. ” I am not stupid . It ’ s just normal mistake . I caught one case at the age of 19 . I am 31 . I have never been back to prison for a crime .
 You ’ re working with some powerful people in the Reform Alliance . Jay-Z , Michael Rubin , Robert Kraft , Clara Wu Tsai . Basically all billionaire except me . Robert Kraft saw me in prison , and he wa like , How are you still smiling ? He wa like , If that wa me , I would be depressed , mad , angry .
 You ’ re not ? You can ’ t sleep . Yeah , but that come from my environment . Coming from seeing violence , people robbed , people murdered , you heard gunshot every night — couldn ’ t sleep .
 So how do you deal with the trauma ? I just override it . I don ’ t know . Rapping is one of my therapy . I ’ ve never been a dweller to sit back and be sad about something . The saddest thing I can think about is Lil Snupe , an artist I had signed , got killed at 18 by a grown man . That bothered me a lot for two year , but I suppressed it and never really addressed it . Then one day , I started realizing that had damaged me , and I thought about it a lot .
 Do you actually think Reform Alliance can change the system ? I think it ’ s a possibility we can make a change . In Pennsylvania , they ’ re talking about changing the law of probation already , to where the cap is five year . That will be a big win for a lot of kid who will enter the system and probably would have gotten 10 to 20 .
 After everything , you ’ re still hopeful . Yeah . Hell , yeah . I got a mean team with me . I don ’ t think none of u lose in anything we do .

 How dozen of people own a slice of a hit .
 By JONAH WEINER
 How many people doe it take to write a No . 1 hit ? In the case of Travis Scott ’ s smash “ Sicko Mode , ” which came out Aug. 3 , 2018 , and ha been on Billboard ’ s Hot 100 chart every week since , 30 different songwriter are credited . That ’ s a preposterously high number that speaks , in part , to the shift in top-tier rap toward a collaboration-heavy , auteurist mode of creation . It also speaks to the song ’ s unorthodox structure . “ Sicko Mode , ” which Scott performed at the Super Bowl halftime show , switch between three different beat created by six different producer , with additional work , it turn out , from a Switzerland-based washing-machine salesman . In addition to three guest vocalist — one of whom is the Canadian superstar Drake , one of whom utters only three word and one of whom ha been dead for 13 year — it includes two vocal sampled from landmark rap song that are themselves dense with further sample from ’ 70s-era funk band and , for good measure , a handful of other landmark rap song . The DNA of “ Sicko Mode , ” that is , carry with it strand of ancient genetic material , and even if much of it is audible nowhere in the song itself , those strand show up in the credit . Here ’ s where each one lead .
 00:00 — 01:00
 1 . The woozy organ riff in the song ’ s first section wa created by the producer and classically trained pianist Rogét Chahayed , whose breakthrough track wa D.R.A.M. ’ s 2016 single “ Broccoli. ” The bass line and percussion come courtesy of Chauncey Hollis , better known a Hit-Boy , whose most famous co-production is Jay-Z and Kanye West ’ s “ Niggas in Paris . ”
 00:28 — 01:00
 2 . Aubrey Graham , a.k.a . Drake , is the first voice we hear , though his verse will be abruptly cut off . Chahayed ha explained that Drake and Travis Scott recorded a complete song over his and Hit-Boy ’ s beat , but in this Frankenstein version , we hear only about a minute of it .
 01:00 — 02:48
 3 . Travis Scott , born Jacques Webster , doesn ’ t appear on his own song until a minute in , when the music change entirely — one of the track ’ s many idiosyncrasy . Scott , asked if he could hear the song ’ s chart-topping potential before it release , say : “ Yeah , but other people weren ’ t hearing it . They ’ re looking at me like I ’ m crazy . I ’ m like , ‘ O.K . Just wait till it drop . ’ ”
 01:00 — 02:45
 4 . In 2015 , the Swiss producer Ozan Yildirim , a.k.a . Oz , wa given an email address that supposedly belonged to Travis Scott . He emailed beat for “ a year and a half , ” he say , with no reply . Finally , a response arrived : “ You have dope [ expletive ] . Keep sending. ” On Jan. 11 , 2018 , Oz sent what would become the second section of “ Sicko Mode . ”
 4A . Oz got help with a synthesizer sound from his friend Mirsad Dervic , a.k.a . M-Dee , an appliance salesman who make music on his day off .
 4B . Oz also used a sound from a pack of sample created by the German producing duo Tim and Kevin Gomringer , a.k.a . Cubeatz .

 The real star of ‘ a star is born ’ is a song that few can agree on . is it any good ? yes . Yes it is .
 By WESLEY MORRIS
 Bradley Cooper ’ s “ A Star Is Born ” is a movie about an unknown singer named Ally , who ’ s afraid to perform her own song until a famous musician take one of her ballad , rearranges it , then drag her onstage to sing it with him for a stadium full of people who have no idea who she is . That song — “ Shallow ” — won an Oscar last month . It ’ s a soaring , Airbus of a ballad that ’ s satisfying to sing whether you ’ re Kelly Clarkson or pitchy old me .
 But “ Shallow ” isn ’ t the number that epitomizes the movie . That come past the halfway point , and your response to it sum up how far under Cooper ’ s spell you ’ ve fallen . I wa under pretty deep . Ally ’ s on the verge of superstardom , but nearly all of the singing we ’ ve seen her do ha been with Cooper ’ s character , Jackson Maine — this impossible fusion of grunge , root country , pill , booze , pain , encroaching deafness and the Whole Damn American Truth .
 We can sense that Jackson ’ s artistic attraction to Ally arises not just from her industrial-strength voice but from her way with an abstractly honest lyric and her knack for melody . She , too , seems “ authentic ” and virtuous ( she scribble down idea in a notebook ; she ’ s struggled and suffered to “ make it ” ) . His aversion to the artifice of showbiz would seem to be hers : It ’ s all about the craft for u , baby . The spell being cast is a matter of taste and prerogative , essentially that Ally is made from Jackson ’ s rib of purity .
 I , at least , assumed that Ally would turn into somebody like Brandi Carlile , a songwriter whose singing regularly reach the stratosphere but who we can tell is grounded and real because she hold a guitar the way , for some of u , a lawyer hold a degree from Yale — and because ... she ... isn ’ t ... a dancer . Ally , on the other hand , doe dance ( perhaps because it ’ s what her craft-neutral wisp of a manager want ) . And the first time we see America seeing her dance is after she ’ s introduced a the musical guest on “ Saturday Night Live. ” The song — “ Why Did You Do That ? ” — open with the plinky simulation of a steel drum or a music box , and then the question “ Why ? ” “ Why do you look so good in those jean ? ” she sings , a if she were all of Destiny ’ s Children . “ Why ’ d you come around me with an as like that ? ” Ally ’ s onstage with new , orange hair . ( Thanks , craft-neutral manager ! ) She ’ s wearing spangling athleisure and a pink hooded jacket made of a fabric I can describe only a “ gift bag. ” She ’ s with a male dancer who ’ s dressed complementarily in blue , and when she say , “ as like that , ” he grind himself into her .
 [ Read Rachel Syme ’ s profile of Lady Gaga . ]
 It ’ s here that I should say that I love this song . But according to the movie ’ s competing authenticity ( Jackson ’ s idea of it versus her manager ’ s ; rock versus pop ) , love is a luxury . Gaga wrote “ Why Did You Do That ? ” with , among other people , Diane Warren , a master of lugubrious balladry , a cheese whiz . But these woman are grilling that cheese . Gaga ’ s enthusiasm for repetition in a chorus slip an earworm on the hook . Why did you do that — do that , do that , do that , do that — to ME ? Next come a sugary helping of “ Hoooh-oooh-oooh , ” while a sloppy , synthy bass line slithers around it all . This song is sung with such umbrage and so much alarm that you don ’ t know whether to sing along or call Gloria Allred .
 But I watched Ally perform it with my hand to my mouth . I might have said aloud : “ Oh , Ally . Jackson ’ s going to hate this. ” And no sooner had I said it than the movie cut to Jackson watching with a face of stone . This song is confection and sex and feel-copping . It ’ s showbiz . Basically , it ’ s everything Jackson would seem to hate about whatever music is right now .
 When the movie cut to Jackson ’ s face , the Ike Turner of “ What ’ s Love Got to Do With It ” crossed my mind . And a few scene later , a version of Ike come over him while Ally is trying to have herself a “ Pretty Woman ” bath and Jackson enters . She ’ s sudsy . He ’ s soused . “ Why you come around me with an as like that , ” he say in disgust . “ Maybe I [ expletive ] failed you , ” he go on . “ You ’ re embarrassing , ” he slur . “ You ’ re just [ expletive ] ugly , ” he slur some more . Jackson doesn ’ t want to see “ Why Did You Do That ? ” a the hit of an ingénue , something anonymous-seeming that a new pop star try before a truer identity bubble up : Pink doing “ Most Girls , ” Katy Perry and “ I Kissed a Girl , ” Rihanna ’ s “ Pon De Replay , ” Gaga ’ s “ Just Dance , ” whatever the perma-ingénue Ariana Grande ’ s currently up to .
 Last fall , this one song , from this megahit movie , provoked perplexed essay and inspired The Times ’ s Kyle Buchanan to track down Warren and ask , Is it supposed to be bad ? Jackson think so . As much a I wanted to save this sexy , damaged , doomed man , on this , we disagree . “ Maybe it ’ s time to let the old way die , ” go his most mournful lyric . But maybe it ’ s also time to admit nothing ’ s wrong with an as like that .

 The origin and meaning of a meaningless viral hit .
 By JODY ROSEN
 The child ’ s song “ Baby Shark ” is a global smash , a hit that ha captivated million , conquering chart from Asia to Australia to the United States , where , this January , it reached No . 32 on the Billboard Hot 100 . It ’ s also a folk song , with origin a obscure a “ The Dowie Dens o ’ Yarrow ” or any of those other ancient air whose authorship long ago vanished in the mist . “ Baby Shark ” is thought to have been born in American summer camp , perhaps several decade ago . It is a staple of singalong , the sort of song that get belted out by group gathered at marshmallow roast and swimming pool . One theory hold that the song wa born in the summer of 1975 , when Steven Spielberg ’ s “ Jaws ” wa in theater and great white shark were gliding through the murky water of collective consciousness , to the strain of John Williams ’ s brooding score .
 The precise provenance of “ Baby Shark ” may never be pinned down . Its recent history is clearer . In November 2015 , Pinkfong , a South Korean educational brand , released a hopped-up rendition with an accompanying animated video . The following June , Pinkfong put out a second video , “ Baby Shark Dance , ” featuring two cute kid performing goofy dance move . It wa this clip that inspired the hashtag # BabySharkChallenge , instigating a viral craze that ha racked up more than two billion YouTube view and spawned unnumbered spinoffs starring everyone from Indonesian farmworkers to Filipino marine to Cardi B to , undoubtedly , your friend , your family , your baby trussed in a shark costume . In the United States , the # BabySharkChallenge ha received an extra viral boost , cross-pollinating with a dance craze linked to Drake ’ s anthem “ In My Feelings , ” in which people exit moving motor vehicle to dance and lip-sync a the car putter alongside .
 In other word , “ Baby Shark ” ha completed two full transmigration between folk and pop . It ’ s a folk song that became a pop song that filtered into social medium to become a folk song again — a grass-roots phenomenon that propelled the pop recording to improbable height of ubiquity . It exemplifies several feature of 21st-century culture : the porous boundary between the pop industrial complex and the amateur homespun ; a globalized circulation of song based a much on meme a on music ; the popularity of unchallenging dance “ challenge ” ; the hegemony of Drake .
 “ Baby Shark ” also exemplifies the timeless appeal of really stupid song . Musically , “ Baby Shark ” is efficient , with a foursquare beat driving an unvarying melody that return repeatedly to the wordless chorus “ Doo doo doo doo doo doo. ” This refrain repeat fully 27 time — a lot , in a song that run 1 minute 36 second . The first minute is devoted to introducing the dramatis persona : “ Baby Shark/Doo doo doo doo doo doo ... Mommy Shark/Doo doo doo doo doo doo , ” etc . The narrative , such a it is , is compressed into the song ’ s final third . The shark family go hunting , and it prey elude capture : “ Safe at last/Doo doo doo doo doo doo . ”
 Even the most rabid “ Baby Shark ” fan will concede that it is infantile . Which is not to say that it ’ s a child ’ s song . In fact , it ’ s an adult song masquerading a a kid ’ song . “ Baby Shark ” ha been sanitized : Traditional version sung by camper are mischievous and macabre , telling tale of shark attacking swimmer who lose limb and , usually , life . ( “ Call 911/Doo doo doo ... It ’ s too late/Doo doo doo. ” ) In one variation , a “ surfer dude ” is mauled , dy and is reincarnated a a baby shark : an artful cycle of gore , death , rebirth and more gore .
 “ Baby Shark , ” by contrast , seems engineered to please the parent . It ’ s a garishly wholesome affirmation of the nuclear family and end happily ; it dance can be mastered by the most rhythm-impaired . Is it a stretch to suggest that “ Baby Shark ” is music for grown-ups who are , a it were , in their feeling , stressed by the turmoil and dislocation of 21st-century life ? Compare “ Baby Shark ” with music popular with millennials : relentlessly dour rap and hip-hop-inflected pop , full of menace and foreboding , which face the bummer of 2019 head-on . “ Baby Shark ” offer an antidote , an escape : a song that delivers u from danger — safe at last ! — leaving nary a trace of blood in the water .

 Beyoncé And Jay-Z know whose work ha long been left out of the canon , and they won ’ t let it happen to theirs .
 By JENNA WORTHAM
 Last year , on one of the first stop of Beyoncé and Jay-Z ’ s “ On the Run II ” tour , the light of London Stadium dimmed , and the video for “ Apeshit ” began playing on enormous screen . The video open with the Carters dressed in gorgeous suit ( hers a Peter Pilotto in pink and red ; his , sea-foam green Dries Van Noten ) standing — alone — in front of the Mona Lisa at the Louvre . “ Have you ever seen a crowd going apeshit ? ” the song asks , and the answer lay in the reaction of the British concertgoers , who screamed , cried and danced .
 Whose history belongs in our museum ? The video and song meditate on this question . The history of black people ha too often been presented a little more than a curiosity . The 1889 world ’ s fair in Paris , for example , included a “ human zoo ” of indigenous people taken from French colony and placed in “ natural ” habitat for onlooker . During the 16th century , Africans were exhibited in the Vatican , and in 1906 a young Congolese man called Ota Benga wa forcibly kept at the Bronx Zoo . Even now , landmark museum like the Louvre tend to exhibit artwork that depicts Africans and their descendant a household servant and domestic worker . The Carters know this painful past , and in “ Apeshit ” they confront it .
 Lyrics like “ We livin ’ lavish , lavish/I got expensive fabrics/I got expensive habit ” could give the impression that the song is merely reveling in the luxury that extreme wealth can buy . One great complexity regarding the couple is their overt embrace of capitalism . Are they disrupting the status quo or reinforcing it ? But just beneath all that spending seethes an abject rage . “ I said no to the Super Bowl , you need me , I don ’ t need you , ” Jay-Z rap . “ Every night we in the end zone , tell the N.F.L . we in stadium too. ” The Carters are Colin Kaepernick-level fed up with institution that barely recognize them , whether it be the Grammys , which nominated Jay-Z eight time last year but gave him zero win , or Coachella , which featured Beyoncé a it first black female headliner only last year . “ Gim me my check , put some respect on my check . Or pay me in equity , pay me in equity ” is about money , yes , but it ’ s also a cry to be acknowledged for what they ’ ve earned . Their best revenge is their paper , but it ’ s also their own music-streaming service ( Tidal ) and a clothing line ( Ivy Park ) .
 [ Get to know the author of this article , Jenna Wortham , in a new Behind the Byline interview . ]
 The Carters have collaborated for almost two decade on song that rotate around their love of money ( “ ’ 03 Bonnie & Clyde ” ) and of infatuation ( “ Crazy in Love ” ) . But “ Apeshit ” represents a new era for their economic philosophy and value system . Wealth isn ’ t just for flashy living ; it ’ s about creating an empire for themselves and their offspring . Love is hard , unflattering work that sometimes requires setting aside ego and reputation . When Beyoncé sings of plan to get her girl and “ put ’ em all on a spaceship , ” you feel that it ’ s not lyrically convenient but that she really mean it . What would a world created entirely by and for black people look like ?
 Even a Beyoncé and Jay-Z have an estimated net worth of more than a billion dollar between them , they have managed to remain largely unscathed by a cultural tide that disdain the obscenity of late-stage capitalism . Perhaps that ’ s because they seem to be trying to undo a larger project of disinheritance . The video continues it tour of the Louvre , showing the Carters and dancer posing among some of the world ’ s most famous art . They are asserting that they belong . “ All of my people , I free ’ em all , ” Beyoncé sings . It ’ s a boast , but it ’ s also their mission .

 The same affected adolescent pain , updated for modern time .
 By JAIME LAUREN KEILES
 If you grew up listening to pop punk , a I did , then it ’ s easy to feel a though the mid-to-late aught were lost to a fold in adolescent space-time . Are we even sure that the genre ever happened ? Pop punk married punk power chord with the singable hook of a radio hit . The aesthetic wa embarrassing , even in it time — circus , graveyard , men in eyeliner . Want to fantasize about murdering your ex ? For a brief , fun lapse in those dubious year , such thought were best expressed in a high , clear whine , interspersed with bout of indiscriminate screaming . Today we might call pop punk “ problematic ” ( or maybe we ’ d call it musical theater ) . To me , at 14 , it wa more than visceral , a soundtrack for a time of hormonal disarray .
 Flash-forward nearly 15 year to the present , and somehow , improbably , pop punk is back in the form of the rap song “ Lucid Dreams ” by Juice WRLD . The track first appeared on the streaming platform SoundCloud and rose through the rank of the Billboard Hot 100 on the wing of brooding , sung-rapped pain : “ I still see your shadow in my room/can ’ t take back the love that I gave you/it ’ s to the point where I love and I hate you. ” “ Lucid Dreams ” is pop punk recapitulated — the same theme , the same whine , the same singable hook , with the power chord swapped out for insular drum and the plaintive guitar of Sting ’ s “ Shape of My Heart. ” It echo the pang of a Fall Out Boy track , throbbing with urgent teenage despair .
 Juice WRLD is 20 , from the suburb of Chicago . He describes his own music a “ a therapy session ” and cite influence like Fall Out Boy , Bullet for My Valentine , Senses Fail and Panic ! at the Disco . Like most rapper of this latest generation , these influence evolved in a post-streaming world , where album existed a free-floating track , somewhat detached from imposed genre label .
 Hit pop song that exploit algorithm are sometimes described a “ Spotifycore ” or “ streambait. ” If “ Lucid Dreams ” wa not produced to game the number , then at least this new system of musical incentive might help explain it unlikely rise . Rap music turn on it habit-forming beat , and pop punk thrives on earwormish hook . Accounting for the keen melodrama of both genre , it make perfect sense that a hybridized form would triumph in this new streaming ecosystem .
 Juice WRLD is not the first or only artist to work in the emo-rap subgenre . The rapper LiL Peep , who died from an overdose of fentanyl and Xanax in 2017 , wa extolled a “ the future of emo. ” The same might be said of XXXTentacion , a rapper who made violent , confessional music before he wa fatally shot last June . The trouble of this music scene have been well covered ; in brief , they reflect the real peril of our time — gun violence , a crisis of masculinity , dual drug and mental-health epidemic . If the pop-punk song of decade past were grandiose enough to be written off a camp , then the latest wave of emo-rap seems somehow right-sized for the terror of our moment . With this in mind , “ Lucid Dreams ” sound le catchy , or maybe it just sound le catchy to adult .

 Our freshest pop and country superstar is not the usual kind of outlaw .
 By LIZZY GOODMAN
 A couple of week before she would step onstage to accept the Grammy for Album of the Year , Kacey Musgraves wa under the cover in the bedroom at the back of her tour bus , pondering the nature of the universe . She had a little unexpected time on her hand . A show in Chicago had been canceled , thanks to the polar freeze that had descended over the Midwest , leaving her stuck in the middle of a vast tundra with a buildup of tour adrenaline and nowhere to put it . She watched some “ The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel , ” read a little “ The Catcher in the Rye ” and then lost herself down her favorite YouTube rabbit hole , a video genre in which someone mash up tweedy old-school physic lecture with wonky electro beat . “ It ’ s like if Daft Punk went totally science , ” she say , “ and I ’ m here for that . ”
 Later , she would stand in a diaphanous scarlet Valentino dress at the Grammys , giving a speech that could , given her tone and reputation , be read a subtly anti-authoritarian . “ Life is pretty tumultuous right now for all of u , ” she told the crowd . “ I feel like , because of that , art is really thriving. ” Musgraves is well known for her support of the L.G.B.T . community , her unabashed love of weed and her ability to turn a cutting phrase in her perfect Texas twang — particularly when she ’ s writing about the shackle of social convention . She started writing her winning album , “ Golden Hour , ” early in 2016 , when Donald Trump wa still assigning stinging nickname to his Republican primary opponent , and began recording it just after Trump ’ s inauguration . She ha tweeted in support of the Women ’ s March and in disdain of Eric Trump ’ s family-branded Christmas ornament . She speaks with pride about the stack of detention slip her mother still keep from her daughter ’ s time in the Mineola , Tex. , school system : “ I wa always getting in trouble for , like , insubordination. ” Add all that to the nose piercing that , a she famously sings on the rapturous single “ Slow Burn , ” made her grandmother cry , and you might expect her album to be a bit of a call to arm , a middle finger to a broken world .
 Not so much . “ I just got tripped out one day , ” she say , musing on her inspiration for the album . “ Thinking , Whoa , wait , we live in this world that seems so mundane , but at the same time that I ’ m sitting here , there ’ s thing that are glowing in the ocean and eating each other — and there ’ s also northern light and shooting star and plant that grow and literally heal people. ” She paused for breath . “ And it ’ s all happening around u , you know ? ” Falling for the man who is now her husband — the singer and songwriter Ruston Kelly — wa another part of the album ’ s genesis . “ It ’ s sort of a love song to him , ” she say , “ but also to nature , the human race , Earth and why we ’ re here . We don ’ t know , and I kind of love it . ”
 In other word , this wry firebrand ’ s big statement on the state of the world — at a time when so many of the issue she ha become famous writing about , like feminism and gay right , are making daily headline — is a metaphysical country-pop record more inspired by Carl Sagan than Willie Nelson . And just so we ’ re clear , Musgraves wa on acid only part of the time . “ It ’ s not like I wa tripping my face off every day , ” she clarifies . ( After she told reporter that psychedelics influenced a couple of song , including “ Slow Burn , ” it wa all anyone wanted to talk about . ) “ It ha only been a couple time . And very responsibly ! Enough to be able to get outside of yourself and see a different perspective or point of view . ”
 What make Musgraves such a resonant figure right now , in fact , is the way her response to a dark , anxious moment in human history is to move willfully closer to lightness , to stillness , toward the possibility of a world that come in more color than red or blue . When she talk about art thriving in this climate , she mean it — just not in the same sense a , say , angry punk railing against the Reagan administration . What she mean is that right now , the best rebellion involves turning off the hate and making space for hope . Or , a she put it : “ The [ expletive ] storm won ’ t last forever , and I want to make music that doe . ”
 [ Watch Kacey Musgraves turn country music psychadelic . ]
 I caught up with Musgraves in Wisconsin , on the tail end of January ’ s alarming deep freeze , which had temperature in the upper Midwest dropping a low a minus 40 . ( I missed her in Chicago , where everyone wa trapped inside , the street vacant apart from the odd extreme-weather junkie taking photograph of ice floe . ) Far from Valentino , she wa , for the moment , in sweaty Victoria ’ s Secret workout tights and a fluorescent-green beanie , sitting straddle-style on the floor of the bar at a Madison venue called the Sylvee , having just finished a workout via Skype with Erin Oprea , a trainer to many of Nashville ’ s star .
 “ O.K. , so this is the one I put on my story yesterday , ” she said , finding a clip she had posted to Instagram and showing me her phone . It wa something called Symphony of Science ’ s “ Quantum World , ” a favorite among those space-disco physic video . “ Featuring Neil DeGrasse Tyson , ” she chuckled , reading from the chyron at the bottom of a related clip . I had indeed seen her Instagramming this kind of mysterious , late-night Discovery Channel-type stuff — the sort of thing teenager once saw at the IMAX theater on a field trip after getting stoned . How did she get into it ? “ Oh , who know , it wa year ago , ” she replied , then sang happily along to a remix that showed Morgan Freeman superimposed on a colorful tunnel of celestial light . One of the scientist ’ 1970s professorial look , she pointed out , wa “ literally like what the band wear ” in her stage show .
 When Musgraves wa 18 and a contestant on the reality show “ Nashville Star ” — she placed seventh — she had to fill out a getting-to-know-the-contenders C.V . Under the category of “ dream vacation , ” she listed “ staying in a huge log cabin in the mountain , riding horse , hunting and four-wheeling with my friends. ” The “ craziest ” thing she ’ d ever done ? “ Hunting for Bigfoot deep in the wood of East Texas . ... We didn ’ t get him. ” That version of Musgraves — the one who cited Jack in the Box egg roll and beer a her favorite food — still appears at every show , even when she ’ s dressed like Bianca Jagger heading to Studio 54 . She ’ s the one leading the ritual preshow group shot of tequila , taken from tiny cactus-shaped glass she and her band have long been toting from show to show . And she ’ s the one hanging with me on the floor of a bar in Wisconsin , looking at video by a user with the handle “ melodysheep . ”
 And yet even in her early year , when Musgraves looked more the part of your average Nashville aspirant , in cowboy boot and blond highlight , there wa always a kind of poise , an innate regality that set her apart . This , perhaps , is the other side of her East Texas grit — the one that manifest le a yee-haw joy and more a D.I.Y . conviction . “ When it come to art , I will not bend , ” she say . “ I won ’ t . ”
 Musgraves grew up in Golden , Tex. , a town so small it doesn ’ t even have an elementary school . “ A few hundred people , ” she guess , is the total population . It ’ s about 90 minute from Dallas , and about six or seven mile outside Mineola , where Musgraves and her sister , Kelly Christine Sutton — a photographer , who shot the “ Golden Hour ” cover — went to school , and where their parent had a small printing shop . “ Even at a young age , ” Sutton say , “ I always knew my sister would be known for her music . And not really on anyone else ’ s timeline . She would make it happen on her own terms. ” It ’ s their parent ’ model of small-town independence , Musgraves figure , that gave her a tend-your-own-garden will . “ A large part of who I am come from the fact that I never saw my parent have boss , ” she say . “ They ’ ve never answered to anyone but themselves . And not in a baller way — like very small-business , check-to-check kind of a thing . But they made all their own decision . ”
 Growing up , she had a Spice Girls poster in her room — Ginger , with her wild tattoo , made a strong impression — and listened to emo rock band like the Used and Dashboard Confessional . But that wasn ’ t the sort of music she played . “ I wa part of this kid ’ group called the Buckaroos that would meet every month in the Fort Worth Stockyards and would dress up in cowboy clothing and stroll the stockyard and learn instrument , ” she recall . “ There were mentor there who kind of encourage kid to learn this old stuff. ” By 9 , she wa writing her own song and playing guitar ; by 12 , she wa singing Western swing and yodeling at festival on the weekend . Bookings and press kit were handled by her grandmother — the same one who later cried when Musgraves pierced her nose , and who referred to “ It Is What It Is , ” the singer ’ s melancholic ode to casual sex , a “ the slut song. ” “ She ’ s a hoot , ” Musgraves say . “ She wa wheeling and dealing . ”
 There wa , of course , the requisite period in which a teenage Musgraves turned her back on the whole cowgirl thing . “ I wa like , Dude , none of my friend think this is cool . If they saw me I ’ d be superembarrassed . I ’ m yodeling , you know what I mean ? ” She rebelled — for a second . “ I chopped off all my hair and wa like : Suck on that ! Now I can ’ t wear a cowboy hat , Mom ! ” ( “ You would not believe how upset my family wa , ” Sutton remembers . ) But this rebellion turned out to be short-lived . By the time Musgraves moved full time to Nashville , at 19 , she had realized “ nobody really in the country world wa embracing the hard-core root of the genre. ” But she had come to worship John Prine and Loretta Lynn — big-hearted , sharp-tongued , storytelling pillar of country ’ s outlaw root who had risen up in the ’ 70 by staging their own insurgency against the bubble-gumming-up of the genre . “ I randomly already had this superknowledge about all the old song that came before me , and that style , the Western fashion , ” Musgraves say . “ I wa like : I ’ m going to bring it back . I want to mix that in with something modern. ” Prine himself is now one of her many admirer ; he compare her to “ a goofy Cinderella. ” “ She ha a certain honesty to her voice , ” he say . “ She ’ s breaking down barrier . ”
 There ’ s a famous tale about Kacey Musgraves ’ s first big showcase performance for the Country Radio Seminar . This is a big-deal event in the business ; it attendee are queen-makers in an industry in which success is still determined by access to radio airwave . The story of her 2013 debut there smack of a plotline on “ Nashville ” — appropriate , given that she co-wrote “ Undermine , ” one of the hit to emerge from the juggernaut TV series . You can easily picture the kind of episode Musgraves ’ s performance might have inspired . A young woman take the stage at the legendary Ryman Auditorium , the so-called Mother Church of country , about to play the song that could make or break her career . We learn that she ’ s being hyped — thanks to her preternatural songwriting skill , good look and the already-feverish crossover response to her first single , “ Merry Go Round ” — a the Veronica to Taylor Swift ’ s Betty : a sassier but potentially just a marketable product . As is the industry ’ s way , the corporate power would like this rising phenom to be herself , but only within reason . They ’ d prefer she refrain from playing what will become her third single — the one with the line about smoking joint and kissing girl — until after she can already be heard in every Walgreens in America . But the woman step up to the microphone , lean into it a little and speaks : “ I ’ m kind of a big believer in people doing whatever the hell they want to do , because I feel like society is probably going to have an opinion either way. ” Then she start strumming “ Follow Your Arrow. ” As she delivers it opening line — “ If you save yourself for marriage , you ’ re a bore/If you don ’ t save yourself for marriage you ’ re a horr- ” — the crowd gasp . Then she finish — “ -ible person ” — and the audience laugh . A star is born .
 It ’ s easy to wonder where Musgraves got the nerve . It ’ s one thing to admire your parent ’ entrepreneurial spirit , and another to hold your own amid the chaos and pressure of the starmaking machine . For Musgraves , performing alongside Dolly Parton at the Grammys , winning Album of the Year , presenting an award at the Oscars — all of this is unequivocally her dream . But it ’ s also something she belief she could live without , and remembering this ha become a kind of daily meditation , especially a the scope of her fame ha increased . “ I don ’ t get high off my own supply , you know ? ” she say , mentioning , by way of inspiration , Willie Nelson ’ s ability to welcome “ Republicans , rapper , president , my grandpa , your grandpa , our hipster friend , me ” without treating anyone a superior to anyone else . “ You can be proud of yourself and excited for what you ’ re doing , and you could even really have a high level of confidence , without being a D-bag . ”
 In Musgraves ’ s mind , she made it the minute she signed her first songwriting deal , back in 2009 , penning tune that would be sold around Nashville to other performer . That wa the day she realized she would never again have to work a job in which she dressed up a Disney character for child ’ s birthday party , one of many day gig she had endured . “ For the next few year , ” she say , “ I wa like : Really ? Wait , I can use my brain , sit on my as and make a living ? ” When her current label first made her an offer to record a an artist , Musgraves turned it down ; she wa having a perfectly good time a a writer . She also knew she didn ’ t have real access to her own voice yet . “ Those song were fine for other artist , ” she say . “ Maybe they could be popular on the radio or something , but they ’ re not very me . ”
 By the time Musgraves eventually located her particular voice , it wa already honed to a sharp edge . Her first hit , “ Merry Go Round , ” from 2012 , is packed with the kind of mordant wordplay she ’ d be known for , conjuring a “ same trailer , different park ” world where people marry out of boredom and settle “ just like dust ” into small-town life : “ Mama ’ s hooked on Mary Kay , brother ’ s hooked on Mary Jane , Daddy ’ s hooked on Mary two door down. ” But after two album and multiple world tour , Musgraves felt worn out by her own verbal cleverness . “ Everyone hopefully know I can flip a phrase by now , and I like that , ” she say . “ But I don ’ t want bumper-sticker songs. ” It also concerned Musgraves that the refreshing directness with which she had addressed social issue might start to feel heavy-handed , even ideologically gimmicky . She is , a she put it diplomatically , “ noticing thing about the world that I ’ m not happy with. ” But when she started working on “ Golden Hour , ” it no longer felt right to address them directly . “ Everyone that ’ s listened to any of my music know exactly how I feel , ” she say . “ This record doe kind of nod to some of the social and political thing that are going on , but it ’ s just doing it in a different way . It ’ s not a linear . ”
 Back on her bus , in Wisconsin , after playing to a couple thousand freezing fan who arrived lit and ready to party , Musgraves decompressed again . Gone wa the collection of product the singer us to transform herself from the kind of girl her sister remembers Musgraves sometimes presented a in high school — “ Converse , Dickies and black eyeliner ” — to the flamboyantly feminine star who share the stage with “ RuPaul ’ s Drag Race ” contestant . ( “ I have thought , Am I just doing this because it ’ s expected , or do I actually enjoy it ? ” Musgraves said to me earlier , while spraying her face with a mist of foundation . “ And it ’ s like : No ! I enjoy it ! ” ) Now she wa in slipper and a kind of housecoat , which I mentioned made her look approximately like my grandmother . “ Let ’ s just say I also have a towel warmer , ” she replied . She puttered around her kitchen , making mug of ginger tea . Then she pointed out where the bus ’ s temperature control were , and the cabinet where she keep the melatonin gummies , and said good night .
 Tucked away with her tasteful crystal collection in the earth-toned bedroom in the back of the bus — the first she ha ever had , after touring for year alongside “ 15 other people ” — there were any number of thing might have turned her attention to . She could have looked at spec for the adult coloring book she ’ s designing with her mother , or maybe FaceTimed with her husband , Ruston Kelly , also on tour somewhere in the frozen Midwest . She might have scrolled through the look her stylist had just sent through for the Grammys ; she wa still searching for something just right to match Dolly Parton . Or there wa Musgrave ’ s common insomnia treatment , shopping on eBay : “ I get down a little rabbit hole , ” she told me , “ ordering old toy that they don ’ t make anymore . Like doll from the ’ 80 or ’ 90 . If I ever have a girl , it could be cute to give her P.J . Sparkles , or Makeup Beauty , or whatever , you know ? ” They would all be shipped to Nashville , where they ’ d be waiting for her when she got home — whenever that wa .
 “ I mean , my 2020 is planned out , ” she told me earlier . “ I ’ m going to be putting another record out . I haven ’ t made that yet , so I need to write that and make that . Lots to do. ” It is imposing , you ’ d guess , to have an album scheduled for release that you haven ’ t begun to record . “ It ’ s scary , ” she allowed . “ You worry that the muse is not going to visit you again. ” She reached for her lip gloss . “ There ’ s no banking on it . So it ’ s odd that there ’ s an entire industry banking on it. ” She ’ s not worried , though . Her latest idea showed up a few week ago — a low-key , “ kind of like Bill Withers meet Sade ” track she ’ s calling , for the moment , “ Good Wife. ” She like it ease , she say : “ It ’ s not trying too hard . ”

 Post Malone , Spider-Man and the unexpected power of adolescent awkwardness .
 By SAM ANDERSON
 Like most ancient people in their declining year , I keep up with today ’ s hit music entirely through my teenage daughter . She carry her Bluetooth speaker from room to room with the tender devotion of a mother cat ferrying kitten across a flooded stream . Thanks to her , we scramble egg and make toast and fold laundry in an ambient cloud of Chance the Rapper , Drake , Nicki Minaj , Nicki Minaj featuring Drake , Drake featuring Nicki Minaj , Lorde , Rihanna , “ country ” Taylor Swift and “ dubstep ” Taylor Swift .
 Over the last year , an increasingly dominant voice in this mix ha been Post Malone , a 23-year-old sort-of-rapper from suburban Dallas . “ Posty , ” a my daughter and other fan call him , first went viral on SoundCloud in 2015 . By 2018 , he trailed only the omnipotent Drake on Spotify ’ s list of most-streamed artist . For a long time I had trouble distinguishing Post Malone ’ s superhits from everyone else ’ s . Like most other post-Drake star , he is an amphibious rap-singer who like to brag about his vast wealth and sexual conquest — except when he is spending long soulful interlude lamenting exactly those thing .
 But Post Malone , my daughter helped me understand , is popular a much for his persona a for his music . He is a superhero of silly , sloppy , irresponsible ease — a hard-living , cheerful goofball whose happiness make everyone else happy . He seems to smile with extra teeth . Post Malone is slightly chubby and unkempt , with scuzzy facial hair and infinite tattoo , including two under his eye that say , in fancy script , “ Always Tired. ” ( He meant to choose two word of equal length , he ha said , but got it wrong because — of course — he wa tired . ) Everything he doe seems half-accidental . He first learned to play guitar because he wa extremely good at the video game Guitar Hero . He chose his stage name using an online rap-name generator . ( His real name is Austin Post . ) He once tweeted a photo of himself in Australia petting a kangaroo , with the caption “ Met a koala today . ”
 This sort of giddy misidentification is , in fact , the key to Post Malone . He is not exactly a rapper but is also not not a rapper . His musical root reach down to country , metal , folk and rock — online , you can watch him play loving cover of Bob Dylan and Nirvana . What finally distinguishes Posty from the mainstream crowd is his voice , which ha a touch of rock ’ n ’ roll grit that wrestle through the Auto-Tune . And yet his megasuccess ha mainly come under the umbrella of hip-hop . He performed his first hit single , “ White Iverson , ” in gold teeth and cornrows , raising inevitable question of cultural appropriation . He say he prefers to think of himself a beyond genre , which is convenient , because he ha sometimes been head-slappingly inarticulate on the subject . “ If you ’ re looking for lyric , if you ’ re looking to cry , if you ’ re looking to think about life , don ’ t listen to hip-hop , ” he once said , to near-universal disapproval .
 Post Malone , in other word , is a big roiling mess of contradiction . No wonder he is so popular with teenager . He is the perfect avatar of adolescence : the excruciating ridiculousness of being a person caught between world , in transition , half-young and half-old , in possession of power you don ’ t fully understand , blasting off into inscrutable realm in which mysterious thing will be expected of you . This also make Post Malone a perfect fit for Spider-Man , the canonical story of awkward adolescent empowerment . Posty ’ s latest No . 1 hit , “ Sunflower , ” is not merely featured on the soundtrack of the franchise ’ s newest iteration , “ Spider-Man : Into the Spider-Verse ” : It is actually used , in the film , to introduce the hero . We meet the teenage Miles Morales in his bedroom , alone , doodling and bobbing his head to the bouncy hit about a dysfunctional relationship . ( “ Callin ’ it quits now , baby , I ’ m a wreck , ” his collaborator Swae Lee sings . “ Crash at my place , baby , you ’ re a wreck. ” ) Miles sings along , straying off key , only to be interrupted by his father , who yell at him to get ready for school . The awkward teenager is called , awkwardly , out into the world . Amid all the cringiness , his unexpected superpower will bloom . Adolescence , despite it obvious flaw , can still save the world .

 A 15-Track Fun house album that add up to a single song .
 By JOHN WRAY
 “ Whack World , ” Tierra Whack ’ s debut collection of 15 track — each clock in at 60 second — wa one of the riskiest gamble of the past year in pop : It would have been written off a a gimmick if it weren ’ t so goofily , trippily , intoxicatingly good .
 The 15-minute album , which dropped in May with an accompanying “ Visual and Auditory Project ” on various video platform , offer a guided tour of one precociously gifted 23-year-old American ’ s worldview . It is both a brazen bid for the big time and a disquietingly intimate glimpse inside a wildly idiosyncratic mind — in tantalizing , and occasionally maddening , chunk of tightly rationed time . The experience is a bit like being invited up to the treehouse of the artsy , slightly spooky girl next door , to discover that it ’ s vastly larger and more colorful on the inside — only to be booted out again before you ’ ve done much more than glimpse the décor .
 Recent year may have seen the rise of what Pitchfork dubbed the “ super-short rap song , ” with ( mostly male ) act like Lil Pump and Trippie Redd releasing track a short a 1 minute 32 second ; but “ Whack World ” is a different beast entirely . Each track end after no more than one minute : some segue seamlessly into the next musical idea , some cut off in what feel like midverse . ( A minute , not coincidentally , wa the maximum length supported by Instagram when “ Whack World ” had it candy-cane-colored debut . ) Repetition is the lifeblood of any pop song , but most of the album ’ s lyrical fragment barely last long enough to revisit the first hook , let alone the chorus — if there is one — before we ’ re off to the next room in the fun house .
 The difference between “ Whack World ” and an aggressively repetitive earworm like Lil Pump ’ s hit , “ Gucci Gang , ” can be summed up very simply : Tierra Whack abhors boredom , and her first line of defense is , for want of a better word , wackiness . Where Pump mumble vaguely about forgetting girl ’ name while walking down a high school hallway with a tiger , holding football-size bag of weed , Whack ride a rickety exercise bike , in a fat suit , singing in a helium-tweaked voice about lowering her cholesterol . She ha the weird kid ’ s ability ( and willingness ) to laugh at herself , a quality that her self-professed role model Missy Elliott and Andre 3000 have always possessed but that is sorely lacking in a great deal of contemporary hip-hop — and pop music in general . It say more than a little about Whack ’ s sensibility , not to mention her take on relationship , that the album ’ s one and only love song is about a dead dog .
 “ Whack World ” the video , with it Mister-Rogers ’ -Neighborhood-with-LSD-in-the-water-supply visuals , invokes Elliott ’ s spirit in another sense too . Tierra Whack is beautiful , in a normal , human way , but unlike many of her contemporary — Ariana Grande , Chris Brown , Ava Max , Drake — she ’ s far too intoxicated by her own hypercreativity to trade on her look . In the video ’ s second vignette , which accompanies the playfully morose “ Bugs Life , ” Whack sits in a nail salon with the right half of her face grotesquely swollen from an insect bite , singing in a voice dripping with deadpan irony : “ Probably would ’ ve blowed up overnight ... if I wa white. ” Sex may sell out where the rest of u live , but it ha marvelously little currency in Whack ’ s treehouse . Whack — a opposed to , say , Frank Ocean — is by no mean a piner . Past romance is referenced from time to time , but largely in passing , a if the interesting stuff lay elsewhere . In fact , the album ’ s speed and brevity feel driven by nothing so much a precocious impatience : You can ’ t escape the impression that it creator would gladly have contributed another six , or a dozen , or even 100 additional track — however many it took to roll up literally everything she ’ d ever experienced into a single beautiful , lopsided , sequin-spangled ball .
 “ Whack World ” subverts accepted notion of “ album ” and “ single ” in equal measure . In spite of it undeniable of-the-moment-ness , this is not a collection of music best served by Spotify ( or any other randomized and algorithm-driven playlist ) . Almost no one , I ’ m willing to bet , would be satisfied playing only one of the album ’ s 15 track . Whack ’ s debut come closest to a distinctly old-fashioned ( and distinctly uncool ) staple of popular music : the medley . In a quarter-hour , she take u on an attention-deficit-disorder safari through seemingly every genre and subgenre that ha ever turned her head , from R & B to trap to doo-wop to reggaeton to — well , to something that can best be described a psychedelic anti-country a sung by Weird Al ’ s manic-depressive little sister . By the time you ’ ve finally begun to acclimate to the sheer magpie-inventiveness of “ Whack World , ” the magical mystery tour is over . And what a short , strange trip it wa .

 Cutting through the ( bong ) smoke to address the whens of climate change .
 By LARRY FITZMAURICE
 Music ha mourned the death of our planet for decade . “ How much more abuse from man can she stand ? ” Marvin Gaye asked in 1971 on “ Mercy Mercy Me ( The Ecology ) . ” The college-rock astronaut Black Francis sang of hole in the sky and rising temperature on the Pixies ’ “ Monkey Gone to Heaven ” in 1989 , grimly concluding that “ Everything is gon na burn. ” Four year later , the dance duo Orbital used warning klaxon on “ Impact ( The Earth Is Burning ) ” to conjure urgency about our impending global doom . Melissa Etheridge asked “ Have I been careless ? ” on a song called “ I Need to Wake Up , ” from the soundtrack to “ An Inconvenient Truth. ” Others , perhaps , are resigned to watching the world burn : “ I wan na see the animal die in the tree , ” Anohni proclaimed in 2016 on her acerbic indictment “ 4 Degrees . ”
 If you ’ ve lost sleep over gigantic hole in Antarctic glacier or the drastic decline of insect population , the last several year have felt like the final third of Lars von Trier ’ s “ Melancholia , ” in which humanity awaits Earth ’ s catastrophic collision with another planet : watching our fate snap back like a boomerang , coming at u faster than ever with little in the way of prevention or defense . Until recently , there have been so many perceived wrong to address on any given day that climate change ha frequently found itself low on the list of to-do ’ s in our general consciousness ; now , not even Demi Lovato and Joe Jonas — whose 2010 climate-change anthem , “ Make a Wave , ” claimed that “ We hold the key that turn the tide ” — can save u .
 Which brings u to the Brooklyn indie rocker Parquet Courts : “ Which hand get to turn the final page ? ” Andrew Savage dryly intones on “ Before the Water Gets Too High , ” a dread-drenched meditation that skip the ifs of climate change and head straight to the whens . How do we prepare for devastation , and can we reckon with how useless our effort to stop it have been ?
 Such question have largely gone unasked in the indie sphere , especially a the genre signifier ha transitioned over the last decade from ethos to marketing term . They ’ re new to the oeuvre of Parquet Courts a well ; before the political party-punk of last year ’ s “ Wide Awake ! ” the band spent more time musing about stoned bodega trip and the literal gathering of dust . But “ Wide Awake ! ” found them addressing sociopolitical concern including gentrification and groupthink , structural violence and the aftereffect of apathy , all with the freaked-out clarity of a wasted reveler realizing that the globe ’ s last keg is about to be kicked .
 The dubby fragrance of “ Before the Water Gets Too High ” suggests that their bong-session day aren ’ t behind them yet , but it also situates the song within dub reggae ’ s history of cutting through the smoke to address the fear involved in confronting societal calamity . “ Glass barely bend before it crack , ” Savage lilt on the song ’ s bridge , underlining the starkest truth of our certain demise : It ’ s coming , and we ’ re all out of warning sign .

 Music not made for this world .
 By ALEXANDRA KLEEMAN
 “ Cerebral pop ” is an uneasy category , like going on a “ working vacation ” or dressing “ business casual. ” The term betrays a certain amount of internal struggle : What exactly is this music asking you to do with your body ? Sigh , stare up at the ceiling fan and ponder the song a if it were a text ? Or do what you do when some other tune catch you — flail your limb , move your hip in weird little circle , bob your head rhythmically up and down ? The world wa built for pop song : Public space pump the voice of star through speaker the way air flow through ventilation duct , and that sweet , consistent flavor — like Diet Coke or pamplemousse LaCroix — pair easily enough with any modern pastime . But if the territory of pop music is everywhere , how and where doe a piece of art pop — something equal part challenging and engaging — make it home ?
 Julia Holter , a Los Angeles-based artist with a background in composition , answer this question by creating otherworldly space in her own work . On her album , medieval harmony and insectlike synths enjamb ; there ’ s a sense that what you ’ re hearing is very ancient and very modern at the same time , or even that those word no longer matter at all . This is the sort of world-building on display in Holter ’ s sixth studio L.P. , “ Aviary , ” which take it title from a line by the Lebanese-American writer Etel Adnan : “ I found myself in an aviary full of shrieking bird . ”
 From it opening — a cacophony of cymbal and anxiously pacing string — the album is a study in creating a private dwelling place amid the chaos and uncertainty of the world . On one track it ’ s a place of emergency , with crisscrossing bagpipe and voice evoking a landscape pierced by unending siren ; on another it ’ s a dream , with a wintry , synth-heavy gloom giving way to hazy tenderness , like a Kate Bush song peered at through depth-obliterating fog . The world glimpsed here are varied , sometimes wildly so , but what they share is the sense that they are not so much depicting reality a taking inspiration from it , channeling familiar feature into new form .
 Out of this thicket of sound and confusion come “ I Shall Love 2 , ” a five-minute track that feel like stepping out of a dark forest that you ’ ve been wandering in a daze , into a clearing where you can feel the full strength of the sun . You may still be lost , but now there ’ s a real sense of liberation to it . Holter begin with a bare-voiced reading of a fragment from an old troubadour song — “ That is all , that is all/there is nothing else ” — followed by soft organ and a cantering , loping beat . There ’ s a lull that last far longer than you ’ d expect before Holter begin to murmur , low and private , a if musing to herself . The lyric are a patchwork — line borrowed from troubadour song and Dante ’ s “ Inferno , ” Holter ’ s own word — all unified by her agile delivery , which glide from that soothing murmur to a yelp to a torch song . One by one , new pattern and phrase are thrust into the space of the song , lingering and dissipating and overlapping , until they ’ ve become a joyous squall , a raucous flock of melody that ’ s ecstatic and ethereal and raw all at once .
 Holter , in other word , take the garden path to catharsis , allowing something uplifting to emerge from the tumult , making chaos resolve itself into something humane and beautiful and full of intention . And she ha found , even at music festival and rock club , hushed and attentive audience for this . ( Much like her contemporary Julianna Barwick or the Norwegian musician Jenny Hval , Holter ’ s music occupies that narrow margin of overlap between the stuff you listen to for pure enjoyment and the stuff you listen to for mental nourishment . ) Her performance are absorbing : They highlight the organic beauty and authority of her voice , the way the meaning of word can be a sort of veneer over their untamed musicality . The music reward more than just hearing it . It reward some other kind of listening , asking you to let yourself become porous .
 And lately it can fill an appetite that seems both modern and primal at once : to make whole a fractured attention span , to find a ritual that work . Our day are full of tiny sliver of time that we offhandedly cram with music , filling the gap between task and place like someone idly coloring in a picture . It ’ s satisfying to engage with sound that won ’ t fit easily into those pre-existing slot , that dwell strangely in the everyday , transforming it , opening it up , urging you to conjure the imaginary , not-yet-existent space in which they might fit . Holter ’ s music is the opposite of filler : It ’ s a trap door leading to someplace that ’ s not your own .

 The pop star cedes the stage .
 By CHARLES AARON
 Maroon 5 ’ s success contains multitude . There may be no better example of this than the group ’ s pop-soul exhalation “ Girls Like You , ” which spent seven week last year atop Billboard ’ s Hot 100 and 33 week in the Top 10 . Though the song began a a demo by the L.G.B.T . artist Starrah , about her own feeling for a female friend , it wa then punched up and polished by a trio of gnomic writer and producer — Henry ( Cirkut ) Walter , Jason Evigan and Gian Stone — before the heavily compressed and reverbed track wa spiced up with the most distinctive voice of the past year , that of Cardi B .
 These figure are not the one who most make “ Girls Like You ” matter , though . Neither doe Adam Levine ( who get a writing credit ) or his happy-to-be-here sidemen who constitute the Maroon 5 touring entity . Nor do the boisterous Voice of Atlanta gospel choir and Equinox Percussion drum corp who enlivened the band ’ s performance of the song during this year ’ s Super Bowl halftime show .
 These contributor all gave shape and solidity to Maroon 5 ’ s vaporous cultural presence . But at a time when woman and nonwhite men have been facing down the White House and law enforcement ’ s relentless disrespect with civic , public and artistic resolve , the most crucial multitude were the 26 female entertainer , athlete , politician , activist and survivor who seized control of the song ’ s video , which wa the most-watched clip of 2018 , with 1.6 billion view .
 As the camera circle , Levine stand in the center of a soundstage , arm by his side , his voice skipping nimbly over the melody . He ’ s the ultimate embodiment of a stubbly , privileged white bro who belatedly realizes that he need his partner . Coming from Levine , the song ’ s colloquial lyric seems to distill toxic masculinity and the exploitation of woman ’ s emotional labor : “ Maybe it ’ s 6:45/Maybe I ’ m barely alive/Maybe you ’ ve taken my shit for the last time , yeah/Maybe I know that I ’ m drunk/Maybe I know you ’ re the one/Maybe you ’ re thinking it ’ s better if you drive . ”
 As the verse-chorus unfolds , Levine is joined one at a time , their back to his back , by the 26 woman . Dancing and exuding playful charisma , some acknowledge him ; some don ’ t . Then , le than two minute in , he suddenly disappears , a if ceding the spotlight . When Cardi B delivers her final flourish , he return briefly , but by the end of the video , the soundstage is occupied by only the woman .
 Adam Levine is to a rock star a a 2019 rock star is to a 2019 rapper . In other word , he ain ’ t it . Rather , he ’ s the genial tattooed tycoon who craves cooler and edgier friend but just can ’ t seem to make it happen . At 39 , he ’ s the shredded-abs dad bod that everybody ha seen one too many time . But in the “ Girls Like You ” video , Levine owns all that . At least in this moment , he leaf the pocket T-shirt on , keep the guitar in the closet and hand the mic to the long-suffering woman who have chosen to support him . For the first time , maybe ever , he flash some legit star-power potency .

 The new face of gangsta rap broadcast his crime and wind up in handcuff .
 By WILLY STALEY
 The first time I saw the video for Tekashi 6ix9ine ’ s “ Gummo , ” I felt a little bit like Rip Van Winkle wandering down from the Catskills . What in the world happened here ? I wa only gone for an hour ! Some element were familiar ( a crew of guy in front of a brownstone , drinking and mugging for the camera ) , and some were menacing ( the number of red bandanna and gun on display ) , but it wa the man at the center of the video who startled me most ; he seemed almost precision-engineered to make people feel old .
 He wa screaming himself hoarse about robbing and shooting people , over a haunting , spare beat , but I ’ d heard that before — it wa his appearance that shocked me . In an era when most young rapper have a couple of face tattoo , 6ix9ine had the number 69 inked above his right eye in 72-point type . He had the same number spelled out in cursive over his left eye . It wa everywhere on his body . His scraggly hair wa dyed ROYGBIV , and he had a grill to match . He looked like one of those frog you ’ re not supposed to touch .
 Within about a year , he would be in federal custody , a 22-year-old facing life in prison for a number of charge , including racketeering and attempted murder . Law enforcement accused 6ix9ine and others in his circle of being member of the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods and , under the RICO Act , charged them with participating in shooting and robbery all over New York City . Normally this sort of arrest lead to an outcry about literal-minded police overreach . Not this time . People generally seemed pleased to see the rapper in cuff .
 This wa partly because 6ix9ine wa universally reviled by music critic and journalist , on account of a crime he committed before he became famous : In 2015 , he pleaded guilty to the use of a minor in a sexual performance , for having filmed and shared on social medium a video of a girl performing oral sex on his friend . But it wa also because he had spent the past year living the life of a Looney Tunes character : courting danger , narrowly escaping it , then taunting his foe . This genuinely incredible run netted him more than 150 story on TMZ : gang member in San Antonio threatening his life ; a shootout at the Barclays Center ; shot fired at a video shoot in Brooklyn ; more shot fired at a Beverly Hills video set . Through it all , he posted on Instagram , usually wearing red , often handling brick of cash , sometimes clutching extremely illegal-looking gun , but never betraying an ounce of concern for his well-being .
 [ More on the rapid rise and sudden fall of Tekashi 6ix9ine . ]
 Cultivating this sort of personal mythology is not at all new ; it date back to the earliest day of gangsta rap . Ever since Eazy-E bankrolled NWA with drug money , a certain proximity to criminality ha been expected of certain rapper . If your music purport to document life on the other side of the law , then you better know what you ’ re talking about . Not long ago , rapper had just a few limited channel through which to prove that they did : lyric , album art and , if they were famous enough , music video . Like Old Testament god , they willed whole universe into being through their word .
 Now they have social medium . Case in point : On “ Stoopid , ” which came out last fall , 6ix9ine insult two rapper he wa feuding with at the time , but unless you were listening for it , you probably wouldn ’ t have noticed . Much more memorable were the Instagram video he made to antagonize the two ; in one he took his rival ’ s former girlfriend and mother of his child out shopping .
 This sort of online mythmaking is second nature to SoundCloud rapper , so called for the streaming service that birthed the scene . SoundCloud rap is not characterized by a particular sound so much a it anarchic energy — the face tattoo , the prescription drug , the orthographically complex handle . This scene ha been alarmingly fecund and seems to accelerate evolution in disturbing direction , a little like Lake Springfield on “ The Simpsons. ” Even within this ecosystem , 6ix9ine stood out like a chumbox thumbnail — is he ... real ?
 The problem , for 6ix9ine , wa that a big part of his adopted persona , both on Instagram and in his music , involved being a member of the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods . According to a Rolling Stone profile that came out after his arrest in November , this wa essentially an act : Danny Hernandez , in the year leading up to his fame , had been a trollish and goofy Bushwick deli employee ; his industry blacklisting had pushed him into the hand of an apparently gang-affiliated manager , who also provided him with a new edge . 6ix9ine is far from the only rapper to have ever made dubious claim to being a Blood , but Instagram ha a way of making even the most absurd feint real . Maybe the whole thing really wa a put-on , but also , he really did it . The Rolling Stone article recount how , at his arraignment , the presiding judge asked the prosecution how it knew Hernandez wa at real-life crime scene . “ The answer wa often simple : Hernandez had posted about it on Instagram . ”
 A liminal space ha always existed between rapper and their persona . Sometimes it ’ s a thin a a fig leaf , but even then it ’ s essential , both legally and morally . The gap between 6ix9ine and Danny Hernandez wa considerably wider , but he snapped it shut with his phone , merging fantasy with reality through a front-facing camera . Once intertwined on a criminal indictment , the two aren ’ t easily unwound . It wa reported in February that 6ix9ine , who pleaded guilty , agreed to help prosecutor in their case against his co-defendant , hoping for leniency : a reduced sentence and possibly witness protection . But helping 6ix9ine disappear into some corner of America might prove difficult , and not just because of the tattoo .

 Talking to the pop star about approaching life a if you ’ re seducing it .
 Interview by LAURA SNAPES
 In 1993 , the Swedish singer-songwriter Robyn turned 14 and finished middle school ; then she signed a record deal . She ha been making music ever since , starting with her 1995 debut album , “ Robyn Is Here , ” which netted her two Billboard Hot 100 single . Her 2005 album , “ Robyn , ” cemented her a a beloved , idiosyncratic pop star and earned her a Grammy nomination . She released a trilogy of mini-albums in 2010 , which included some of her biggest hit — “ Dancing on My Own ” and “ Call Your Girlfriend. ” Now , after a long gestation period , she ha returned with a new album and single , “ Honey . ”
 You ’ ve described the making of this song a searching for a feeling . A feeling of healing from sadness and wanting to share that with the world and with myself — a sense of self-love , excitement , some kind of peace of mind . Like when your strength is coming back . I wanted to describe this feeling like when you ’ re super close to someone else ’ s skin , or when you ’ re falling asleep , or when you ’ ve taken a drug that ’ s starting to kick in — sensation that are pleasurable , where your body is reacting to something outside of you .
 I felt naïve because I thought it wa about self-discovery , but a friend said , “ No , it ’ s about oral sex ! ” It could be about oral sex , sure ! Intimacy , definitely , but it could be with yourself . It doesn ’ t have to do with another person . In a way I think your analysis is probably the best one , because isn ’ t oral sex self-discovery ? Any experience you have that will give you a new point in your scale of emotion will make any other experience richer because you have a new point of reference .
 Maybe it ’ s about elevating self-care to the level of eroticism ? Not reserving that deep pleasure for a sexual sensation , but something you could experience day to day . Exactly ! That ’ s exactly it . It ’ s like approaching life a if you ’ re seducing it . As if you ’ re seducing yourself , or the other person , or your work , or whatever . Intimacy in every little thing .
 How do you approach life a if you ’ re seducing it ? I feel like I have to work for it every day . It ’ s like starting a little fire : You have to be so careful with it , not force it . You get it going and then you can use it and tend to it and start it back up again .
 Is your fire well tended ? Not at all . I ’ m not in a great place at the moment , to be honest . It ’ s a good conversation for me to have , a good reminder . I maybe need to go back and listen to some of my song myself to figure this out .
 [ How Robyn , pop ’ s glittery rebel , danced her way back from darkness . ]
 Your song are known for intermingling sadness and euphoria . But “ Honey ” is le triumphant than that . I don ’ t think life is that easy anymore . I used to believe it would all make sense if you just powered through . I really don ’ t feel that way anymore at all . I think it ’ s pragmatic — I really don ’ t feel pessimistic .
 The idea of “ self-care ” can seem like a challenge . Post-recession capitalism ha glorified the hustle so much . The society we live in at the moment — we didn ’ t really make it very good , you know ? It ’ s really tough to take care of yourself . Self-care is difficult when you have a 9-to-5 job , and people are on Instagram projecting these image of themselves — we ’ re in a time where everyone ’ s engaged in storytelling in such an aggressive way . Stories are amazing — they ’ re part of what it is to be human — but you have to be aware they ’ re story . That ’ s the problem with capitalism : It ’ s always trying to trick you into thinking there ’ s a purpose for all of this . But you can actually use a story that relates to something more real than buying yourself out of anxiety .
 It ’ s jarring to see people turning themselves into personal brand a part of that storytelling . That ’ s the strange thing about being an artist . There ’ s always a gap between how I see myself and how other people see me . When I wa younger , I felt like it wa easier for me to absorb other people ’ s thought about me , and more complex to understand what wa me and what wa other people , and how to respond to those expectation . I ’ m still learning that . I ’ ve been more specific with my expression on this album than I ’ ve been able to be before , but I ’ m aware that that doesn ’ t mean that people understand me . I don ’ t even know if that ’ s the point .
 A lot of today ’ s pop is about nihilism , depression , anxiety . There ’ s real sadness behind your album , too . It struck me a something that ’ s easy for the industry to exploit . Definitely : Pop at the moment is depressing . Hip-hop is really dark . The music kid are listening to is heavy ! Maybe it ’ s hard to be positive and optimistic at the moment , for a lot of young people — the number of voice that are trying to share this space in their brain is crazy . But maybe it ’ s cool that they get to explore their darkness a a collective earlier in life , because maybe it will also get them to the point where they ’ re letting go of it early a well .
 Is the industry set up for artist to be able to share their pain but protect themselves ? It ’ s really difficult for anyone to not be exploited in our society a a whole . As an artist , you ’ re exposed , because you deal in emotion all the time . People want you to be vulnerable . If you think about sport — you look at it because someone ’ s pushing themselves to their limit . If you don ’ t risk anything , why would people want to see it happen ?
 You turn 40 this June . You could listen to “ Honey ” a a celebration of the richness that come with age , and maybe aging a a woman . I think it can be that , for sure . I ’ m not looking forward to being 40 , to getting older . I know that ’ s not a very mature thing to say , but it is what it is .

 Who knew that flamenco — and a medieval love-gone-wrong tale — could be so relevant ?
 By MARTA BAUSELLS
 It wa hard to tell how many people in the club liked flamenco , an art form not much associated with young people anymore . But on New Year ’ s Eve in Barcelona , when the palmas hand clap that open Rosalía ’ s “ Malamente ” started pulsing from the speaker , look of recognition flashed from face to face . And by the time Rosalía — an artist from the nearby town of Sant Esteve Sesrovires — started rapping , everyone wa clapping along . Some of the younger girl even twerked .
 It ’ s not unheard-of for flamenco to make incursion into mainstream Spanish pop culture , but Rosalía is different . She sound and feel cosmopolitan , cool in a sophisticated and almost foreign way . She doesn ’ t sound a if she ’ s playing just for u . And indeed , she isn ’ t : This two-and-a-half-minute song , with it balmy synth bass and irresistible syncopation and enticing whisper peppered throughout , ha racked up more than 59 million view on YouTube . Her success , she ha argued , is partly because of listener ’ weariness with the homogenization — which is to say , the Anglicization — of pop . Her own aesthetic is polished , globally recognizable , informed by hip-hop and trap music . But it ’ s also saturated with bullfighting and windmill and fire . Her sophomore album , “ El Mal Querer ” ( which roughly translates a “ loving badly ” ) , is a conceptual project patterned on the subversive medieval text “ Flamenca. ” The last frame of the “ Malamente ” video feature a figure wearing the conical capirote hat worn by penitent during Holy Week — while also riding a skateboard .
 “ Malamente ” ’ s appearance in the club also seemed to inspire a few eye roll . Maybe this is the price of success in a culture that look askance at overt display of ambition or self-actualization , especially by woman . By New Year ’ s Eve , Rosalía had come up in every conversation I ’ d had for day — she wa a interesting to my grandmother a she wa to my 12-year-old cousin . The local fascination tended to focus le on her art and more on her a a phenomenon , on the extraordinary speed of her rise to stardom . It would spark argument too , about cultural appropriation and the Romany community , who have always been closely associated with flamenco .
 “ Malamente ” mean “ badly , ” and the story of “ Flamenca ” is not a happy one . A woman get married to a man who later grows jealous and imprisons her . It ’ s not surprising , these day , that a global star would be singing about such suffering . But Rosalía reminds u that pain and possession are topic that have interested human for century . Millions of her listener must be enjoying this music without understanding the language , but right now , for me , it feel cathartic — soothing , even — to be able to stand in a crowd singing “ badly , badly , so badly ” while clapping my hand .

 Interview by HAZEL CILLS
 Last fall , Marie Davidson , a French Canadian producer of electronic music , released “ Work It , ” an aggressively rattling track on which she serf “ kind of like an M.C./personal trainer , ” exhorting listener not to dance but to work , constantly and sweatily , seven day a week . The song became a minor anthem , and the album it came from , “ Working Class Woman , ” wa embraced a one of the best dance record of the year .
 What sort of place were you at in your life when you wrote this song ? Obviously I wa working a lot . I had already toured Europe and the U.S. , and I wa going back to Europe to play festival . I wanted to make a banger to play live — I just picked up my microphone and started talking . The song came out in a funny way , but the undertone is serious .
 I don ’ t think all people should work all the time . It ’ s sarcastic , it ’ s humorous , but in the joke there ’ s also truth . It ’ s why I say , toward the end , that when I say “ work , ” you have to work for yourself , love yourself , feed yourself . Whatever you do , whatever amount of energy you put into something , you have to do it for yourself and not to please others . Not to build this facade or this persona or achievement .
 Do you think people base too much of their self-worth on their work ? Absolutely . We live in a society that is based on work — goal , achievement , money . Of course ! It ’ s a real problem — workaholism , exhaustion , burnout . We ’ re not taught in this society — it ’ s not valued — to take time and just learn to love yourself . You ’ re taught to be strong , to look smart , to be useful . But I think you become a much more useful person if you learn how to love yourself .
 Do you think people who aren ’ t musician are aware of how physically taxing it can be ? It would be hard to know . When you look at picture or video , it doesn ’ t look like that . It look really fun and glamorous . And it is , sometimes , for a few hour . But it ’ s not a glamorous job being a touring musician . I still have people come up to me after a gig or somewhere , saying : “ You ’ re so lucky . I wish I had your life. ” And I ’ m like : What do you mean by that ? Do you think I woke up one morning and became who I am ? It ’ s year and year of work and trial and error . It ’ s a real job , like being a carpenter or being a designer .
 People think of the dance floor a this freeing space . But you ’ re kind of pointing out that this is just another workplace . For me , at least , it is . It used to be different . When I wa 16 and I started going out in Montreal , going to underground party and raf and club , it wa magical . But it wa different : I wasn ’ t working . It wasn ’ t my job . I wa going there for fun . Even if I wa playing , it wa special . It wasn ’ t in the schedule , where you just do it over and over again . That space is now a work space for me . There ’ s no more leisure . I ’ ve sacrificed that freedom for other thing . Now if I want to feel something mind-blowing or magical , I have to look for it outside of club culture . The music never loses it magic , but the social thing happening at a party or something like that ? No .
 It sound a though the song stemmed from your personal experience , but it feel universal . When I made it , I knew anyone could relate . Because this is the time we live in . Everything go really fast now . People are expected to produce and achieve . It ’ s kind of sad , I think . There ’ s a rigidity in that mind-set about what you should be doing with your life . We ’ re ruled by capitalism , so that ’ s what we get . We are living comfortably , and people feel that they are free , but I don ’ t think that individual are that free in society .
 So how do you make art under capitalism ? I don ’ t care . When I ’ m in my studio composing music , I really don ’ t think about that — about what is the potential of that song , where is it going to take me , what doe it mean to the world . I don ’ t care . I never did . I don ’ t think about my label or my manager or anybody . My insecurity come after , when it ’ s time to be in the world .

 The british singer-songwriter who turned homage into a signature style .
 By JONAH WEINER
 James Blake wa talking about shanzhai , a Chinese phrase that mean , roughly , “ knockoff , ” and that stem from the time-honored tradition in Chinese art of apprentice ’ mimicking their master — “ copying something until you can better it , ” he said , “ or if not better it , compete with it . ”
 Blake , a Grammy-winning avant-gardist with an ear for pop , who ha been playing the piano since he wa about 6 , ha a long list of hero whom he ha studiously copied in pursuit of his own sound . Copying the virtuoso jazz-pianist Art Tatum , the protominimalist French composer Erik Satie and the midcentury gospel maestro the Rev . James Cleveland taught Blake novel way of opening up complex chord structure and fitting them — to gorgeous , aching effect — around deceptively simple melody . Copying singer-songwriters like Joni Mitchell and Stevie Wonder emboldened him to write and sing pop song with increasing emotional candor . Copying the hip-hop producer Timbaland and the South London dubstep craftsman Mala informed Blake ’ s love of distorted timbre — electronic rhythm that skitter and twitch a often a they groove — and of sampling , a technique of literal copying ( and cutting and pasting ) so central to Blake ’ s practice today that , even when he isn ’ t sampling anyone else , he routinely sample himself . “ I ’ ll sit at a piano , improvising ” into a microphone , he explained , then search the tape for building block that he can pluck out and , with editing software , arrange into new composition .
 Blake stand at an imposing 6-foot-6 and carry himself with the deliberateness of a man at risk of scraping his head on doorway . Early in February , in a wood-paneled rehearsal space in the Larchmont neighborhood of Los Angeles , he sat at a Prophet ’ 08 synthesizer opposite Rob McAndrews , a multi-instrumentalist , and Ben Assiter , a drummer , his longtime friend and touring bandmates . At their foot , black cable snaked and cloverleafed among cluster of red- , blue- , silver- and cream-colored effect pedal , like track connecting village in a model-train set .
 Blake is from London , but three and a half year ago he began dating the British comedic actress Jameela Jamil , and when she booked a lead role on the NBC sitcom “ The Good Place , ” he tagged along with her to California . Now Blake led McAndrews and Assiter through a practice run of “ I ’ ll Come Too , ” a swooning new song about joining Jamil out west — about that moment when you want to follow a crush anywhere . The song come from his fourth LP , “ Assume Form , ” which wa released in January . “ That ’ s a fun one to play , ” he said when they finished . “ I really like it . But it ’ s hard — I ’ m singing all the way through , in all these different range , and I don ’ t get a chance to breathe . When I recorded it , I broke the vocal up . ”
 The extent to which Blake ha digested the lesson of his musical hero is illustrated not only by his decade-spanning run of single , EPs and album but also by the number of pop auteur who have collaborated with him . Frank Ocean , Beyoncé , Kendrick Lamar , Jay-Z , André 3000 and Travis Scott are among those artist who have enlisted Blake ’ s assistance . As an influence and a collaborator , Blake ha helped shape two of the more striking trend in contemporary pop : beat that mutate over the course of a song , resisting any traditionally identifiable center , and an emotional atmosphere in which the line between hedonism and melancholy , bliss and despair come undone .
 His influence extends even to artist he hasn ’ t worked with directly . In 2011 , I visited Drake — a pop giant whose entire musical project ha been about smudging the line between hedonism and melancholy — at a converted Toronto warehouse , where he wa working on his second album with his musical right hand , the producer known a 40 . The room wa free of decoration save for 40 ’ s copy of Blake ’ s debut LP , perched on a windowsill like a talisman . Drake later sampled unreleased music of Blake ’ s on a single called “ 0 to 100/The Catch Up. ” Blake , who hadn ’ t approved this usage , got his part removed . At the start of his career , Blake told me , he ’ d been a solitary , “ solipsistic ” bedroom producer . “ I wa so protective of my idea — so militantly and obsessively protective , ” he explained , that it wasn ’ t until year later , when “ I found personal openness , for maybe the first time in my life , that I found collaborative openness , too . ”
 “ Assume Form ” is an album expressly about getting out of one ’ s skull . Five-odd year ago , Blake suffered from a depression so severe that he considered suicide . “ Assume Form ” chronicle his escape from that depression , and it title track , which lead the album , play like a statement of purpose . Blake described it to me a “ a song about intimacy — about feeling like you don ’ t deserve intimacy and feeling like there ’ s no way somebody could really want it with you. ” The song ’ s theme are sex , shame and — by the end — happiness . “ It ’ s by far the most vulnerable , exposed song on the entire record , ” Blake said . “ It ’ s saying , If you ’ re comfortable with this , then the bar ha been set . ”
 Blake wa two and a half week into rehearsal for a tour that would take him around the country and then around the world . He and his band manned a variety of instrument , mostly electronic : the Prophet ’ 08 ; a large , modular synthesizer , studded with knob , plug and blinking light , which McAndrews operated ; and a rubber-covered pad , nestled between cymbal and high-hats , that Assiter thwacked with drumstick to trigger pulse and prerecorded percussive sound . Translating and arranging Blake ’ s intricate studio creation for live concert is a tricky task made trickier still by his refusal to use a laptop . “ With live electronic music , I ’ ve seen the man-checking-emails situation so many time , ” Blake said , referring to that category of lackluster performance in which artist stand unbudgingly at MacBooks , pecking at key . “ I want an audience member to see what ’ s happening . So if Ben is playing the kick and Rob is over here fiddling with knob and it ’ s clear that what he ’ s doing is changing the sound , then it make sense . ”
 The trio consulted a whiteboard upon which the new album ’ s dozen song were listed . “ Should we try ‘ Assume Form ? ’ ” Assiter asked . Blake furrowed his brow . The new album ’ s title track is , structurally speaking , strange . As it lyric switch between optimistic vow of commitment and confession of insecurity , this duality is echoed in the music , which consists of two alternating piano motif — one shimmering , the other overcast . The track began a a long , meandering improvisation from which Blake eventually sampled two disparate chunk , putting them into jarring conversation . When I asked Blake to explain the harmonic unease between these two part , he replied : “ The song essentially modulates from D major in the first section to B flat in the second , which are unrelated key . The first section ha the tonic a the bass note , which give it this firmly rooted presence , whereas the other section ha the third in the bass , which make it feel suspended — which is when the lyric turn to self-doubt. ” He thought for a moment . “ It ’ s quite an odd pairing . It doesn ’ t work , musically . But there ’ s a harmony there . Joni Mitchell doe something similar on ‘ My Old Man , ’ where it go into a minor key when she sings , ‘ But when he ’ s gone . ... ’ ” Complicating thing further , Blake ’ s piano playing on the track wa “ loose — like , microsecond ” offbeat , he said , which would add yet another layer of difficulty when it came to replicating “ Assume Form ” live . “ Let ’ s try something else , ” he told Assiter .
 Blake wa raised by his father , James Litherland , a singer-songwriter and guitarist with a prog-rock pedigree , and his mother , a graphic designer and cycling instructor , in Enfield , a North London suburb . He described his life from adolescence on a largely unhappy , warm and supportive parent notwithstanding . “ I had anger , ” he said . “ A lot of it. ” As a teenager , “ I had terrible acne , and now I think it wa a physical presentation of how angry I was. ” What angered him ? “ My treatment by other people , ” he said . “ People I ’ d been open with . Romantic and personal betrayal . And just a feeling of persecution . I didn ’ t fit in , and I resented not fitting in . I had a couple friend outside of school , so I wasn ’ t totally alone , but I remember year of sitting by myself at lunch . Or just going home because I didn ’ t want to suffer in public. ” Rather than getting out this anger , he repressed it . “ As a child I wa very open and emotionally vulnerable and said how I felt , ” he recalled . “ And I sort of had that beaten out of me — not physically but emotionally . At school , and in British society , there wa this sense of , if you don ’ t behave in the right way — if you ’ re not coolheaded — then people punish you for that . So that wa my childhood , that reflex being stamped out of me . And it stayed with me well into my 20 . ”
 Instead , Blake said , music “ started to be my first language ” and “ talking about how I felt wa second or third. ” In 2007 he enrolled in the Popular Music program at Goldsmiths University of London . As important a his class were the nighttime excursion he took to club like Plastic People and Mass . There , Blake discovered a community of producer and D.J.s — black , white , “ from all part of London , ” he said — who were busy hashing out the oblong dimension of dubstep , a new kind of dance music defined by cavernous reverb , sinister drone and deceptively complex rhythm in which growlingly deep bass line were the primary propellant . Whereas an amped-up version of dubstep soon grew into a global phenomenon , throbbing in GoPro commercial and glitzy Las Vegas club , it wa more subtle in it dynamic at first . Its architect assumed gnomic pseudonym like Coki , Skream and Loefah and tended to direct attention away from themselves and toward the dance floor . “ You can imagine how that appealed to me at the time , ” Blake said .
 On small but influential label , he began releasing his own dubstep-inspired song marked by his sophisticated harmonic sense . Initially he sampled other people ’ s vocal , but later he began singing himself . Blake eventually became comfortable enough to let his voice — a lovely , quaking baritone — ring out clearly , but at first he distorted it self-protectively : “ I intentionally disembodied my voice , ” he said , explaining that “ there ’ s a safety in alteration , because it no longer ha to represent the natural resonance that came out of your chest . ”
 In 2011 , his debut album , “ James Blake , ” wa shortlisted alongside release by Adele and P.J . Harvey for Britain ’ s prestigious Mercury Prize . The album ’ s fan included Bjork , who attended Blake ’ s concert ; Thom Yorke , who dropped Blake ’ s song into D.J . mix ; and Brian Eno and RZA , who collaborated with Blake on “ Overgrown ” ( 2013 ) , which wa also shortlisted for a Mercury ( this time he won ) . Success didn ’ t cure Blake ’ s long-seething unhappiness , however . Around this time , he told me : “ I wa at home , playing PS4 and smoking weed , which I ’ d been doing a lot , and I started to have these hallucination of black . The screen stopped being the game and started being the void . I had physical tremor and panic attack and had to go to my room and just lie there . I started saying thing like , What ’ s the point ? What ’ s the point of me ? ”
 He wa having trouble writing new music , which inspired an existential dread in him . He remembered thinking , That ’ s my only expression a a human being , so I may a well not be here . He never took concrete step to kill himself , he said , “ but I wa thinking about it a lot . Thinking about nothingness . I wa just despondent . It didn ’ t matter to me whether I wa here or not . So I wa at that point . And I wa caught just in time . ”
 It wa Jamil who caught him — she , more than anyone else in his life , Blake said , helped him to break free of his self-destructive tendency , prodding him to speak up when he grew sullen and requiring complete emotional transparency . “ Nothing else will do , ” he said . “ In a relationship , something rot unless there ’ s full disclosure. ” He also saw a therapist specializing in a technique known a eye-movement desensitization reprocessing , or E.M.D.R. , in which a patient recall unhappy memory while moving the eye back and forth rapidly and tapping the hand in time — reconfiguring a relationship to past trauma , in effect , by setting them to a beat .
 Blake ’ s default mode on “ Assume Form , ” which he call “ essentially a pop album , ” is one you might call cautious euphoria . It is also the most collaborative thing he ha put out , featuring guest production from the Atlanta-based hip-hop luminary Metro Boomin and a series of duet with star like Travis Scott , André 3000 and the breakout Catalan singer Rosalía . It would be important , Blake said , when playing these song live , to carve out room for improvisatory run . “ After seven show , you almost feel like you ’ re on rail , and I hate that , ” he said . “ Feeling like I don ’ t have a choice . With tour you ’ re already so tightly scheduled in all other regard , that ’ s when I start to get anxious , feeling like I ’ m locked in . ”
 The band moved next to a song called “ Where ’ s the Catch , ” on which Blake and André 3000 sing and rap , respectively , about what Blake characterized a “ a distrust of really great thing : ‘ Everything ’ s seemingly nice — for today . But what ’ s around the corner ? ’ ” Rather than play André ’ s verse all the way through at concert , the band intended to chop up his vocal and distribute them across the track in stuttering burst . As they rehearsed the song , Blake ’ s vocal , too , were chopped up and fed through McAndrews ’ s synthesizer , where he warped them even further . The trio rode out the song with a jam session , adding layer after layer of noise on their way to a squalling crescendo . Blake ’ s vocal grew increasingly refracted and spectral , and there wa something both frightening and exhilarating about the sound of the electronics swallowing him up whole .

 A shameless polymath pop act delivers the cascading-contemporary-references track we didn ’ t know we needed .
 By STEVEN HYDEN
 ‘ Love It if We Made It ” is a Jedi mind trick . This is the track with contemporary relevance that you ’ re looking for . You will consider it a statement that mimic the nonstop rattle of social medium and the slow drip of Trump-era anxiety . The song , though , is decidedly le subtle than the wave of Obi-Wan Kenobi ’ s hand : Matty Healy , the gregarious lead singer of the English pop-rock band the 1975 , delivers his litany of contemporary pop-culture reference in an impassioned emo-dude howl , over an unchanging and relentless synth-pop stomp that sound like New Order paying homage to the Fall . Donald Trump , Kanye West , Eric Garner , Lil Peep , the failure of modernity , the ubiquity of fake news , Healy ’ s own heroin addiction — it ’ s all accounted for with the maniacal thoroughness of Billy Joel straining to rhyme “ Zhou Enlai ” with “ Bridge on the River Kwai . ”
 But “ Love It if We Made It ” no longer make me think about the Sturm und Drang of right now , or about millennials , or about being extremely online . It make me think of one of the most popular rock band of the ’ 70 and ’ 80 .
 I blame “ Bohemian Rhapsody. ” It ’ s tempting to view the runaway box-office success of the Freddie Mercury biopic — with a worldwide gross of $ 860 million and counting , it ’ s the most popular film about a real-life musician ever made — a an indication that the public yearns for the return of band that will ( stomp ) will ( stomp ) rock you ( clap ) . But overt revival act — like the popular Michigan act Greta Van Fleet , whose member all dress exactly a Brian May did in 1973 — tend not to sonically resemble Queen beyond it first single , the quicksilver Led Zeppelin nod “ Keep Yourself Alive. ” No , the contemporary band that come closest to emulating Queen ’ s whole legacy — a a shameless polymath pop act , willing to try anything , including but not remotely limited to metal , disco , rockabilly , theatrical English music-hall , folk , synth-pop and power ballad that turn unexpectedly into mock-opera freakouts — is the 1975 . ( Perhaps Greta Van Fleet should have called themselves the 1973 . )
 Here ’ s a scene that ’ s not in “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” : In 1978 , while making Queen ’ s seventh album , “ Jazz , ” Freddie Mercury wa inspired to write his own litany-of-pop-culture-references song . He decided that “ Jaws ” wasn ’ t his scene , and he didn ’ t like “ Star Wars. ” He wa also skeptical of God , Peter Pan , Frankenstein and Superman , but staunchly pro-drugs . There wa no such thing a logging off back then , so his symbol of freedom and release wa an old-fashioned one : bicycling . “ I want to ride it where I like , ” Mercury sang , a always committed to nothing else above his own liberation . “ Bicycle Race , ” a worldwide hit , is a perfect example of how Queen routinely violated one of the central truism of rock , later articulated by David St. Hubbins in the 1984 film “ This Is Spinal Tap ” — “ It ’ s such a fine line between stupid and clever. ” The implication is that striving for transcendence is admirable , but it can easily embarrass you .
 [ Can a quote-unquote band drag rock into the future ? The 1975 is trying it hardest . ]
 For Mercury and his bandmates , there wa no line between stupid and clever ; in many of the best Queen song , stupid is clever . It take a special kind of fearlessness to write song about killer queen who are dynamite with laser beam , or fat-bottomed girl who make the rocking world go ’ round , or really fast car that you might want to have sex with . Part of the thrill of listening to Queen is hearing them get away with this sublime silliness , again and again .
 The 1975 have a similar inclination , in the word of Spin magazine , “ to look and sound ridiculous. ” When the band made it debut on “ Saturday Night Live ” in 2016 , Healy pulled out every conceivable louche rock-singer move — he wore leather pant with no shirt , he tousled his curly black Sideshow Bob mane , he stuck out his tongue , he thrust his crotch like Tom Jones serenading an audience of divorcées . And yet there ’ s an ongoing debate a to whether the 1975 should even be considered a “ real ” rock band at all . Its third album , “ A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships , ” is it most willfully diffuse yet , touching on bedroom R. & B. , jazzy torch song , SoundCloud rap , ambient music and lot of other genre that a “ smarter , ” more conservative band would never dream of dabbling in . Last year , when pressed by Pitchfork to explain “ Love It if We Made It , ” Healy posed a delectable stupid-clever rhetorical : “ How weird is reality ? ”
 The 1975 polarizes indie-rock fan — a bloc never comfortable with ostentatious display of self-valorization — but detractor and admirer alike agree on this band ’ s utter absurdity . There may be no other way for a proper rock band to act . At a time when our life are on display like never before , putting u all on the razor ’ s edge of life-changing public shame , how exhilarating is it to see people insist on riding where they like ?

 Growing up mean seeing hero age , rudely , at the same pace a you .
 By LYDIA KIESLING
 In one episode of “ The Office , ” Michael Scott ( played by Steve Carell ) put together a video called “ Lazy Scranton ” to welcome new employee to his branch . In keeping with his character ’ s genius for mangling pop-culture reference , the video is Michael ’ s misguided stab at parodying the viral “ S.N.L. ” digital short “ Lazy Sunday , ” wherein Andy Samberg and Chris Parnell rap about getting cupcake and going to see “ The Chronicles of Narnia. ” Michael ’ s version , which includes line like “ Call poison control if you ’ re bit by a spider/But check that it ’ s covered by your health care provider ! ” leaf the new employee stone-faced . When one of them quits , Michael pleads with him . “ Didn ’ t you think ‘ Lazy Scranton ’ wa funny ? ” “ No , ” the employee say . “ Was it supposed to be funny ? ”
 I thought about this moment when I heard “ Can ’ t Knock the Hustle , ” a song Weezer released late last year . The track , a reimagining of Jay-Z ’ s song by the same title , is the marquee single from the band ’ s “ Black Album. ” I first heard Weezer ’ s version while driving a car , and I almost had to pull over . “ What is happening ? ” I asked .
 The Jay-Z original is about selling drug , with line like “ At my arraignment screaming/All u black got is sport and entertainment , until we even/Thieving , a long a I ’ m breathing , ” with a chorus sung by Mary J. Blige . The Weezer interpretation is about the gig economy and unspools in painfully dorky line like “ I ’ m an ugly [ expletive ] but I work hella harder/And you can write a blog about it ” and “ Leave a five-star review and I ’ ll leave you one too. ” The song is unnervingly , relentlessly bouncy . In the video , Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy play a beleaguered ride-share driver . “ What is happening ? ” his face seems to say .
 Earlier this year , the band released an album of actual cover ( “ No Scrubs , ” “ Paranoid ” and “ Africa , ” among others ) , none of which had the overwhelmingly depressing effect of “ Can ’ t Knock the Hustle. ” What is happening with this song ? There ’ s the peculiar comic engagement with the desperate race to the bottom for American employer . There ’ s the white appropriation of black art , a refraction of hip-hop trope that is about one thousand time le successful than “ Lazy Sunday ” ( possibly even “ Lazy Scranton ” ) . And there ’ s the growing-old phenomenon of seeing former hero make choice you don ’ t understand , in a way that make you grapple with all your own previous choice .
 I have to acknowledge that I may be taking “ Can ’ t Knock the Hustle ” personally to an unreasonable degree . Weezer is a band with a fanatical but divided fan base , much of which belief that the band went downhill after it second album , “ Pinkerton ” ( there ’ s even an “ S.N.L. ” skit about this schism ) . I ’ m a Weezer fan who considers her soul to have been irrevocably altered by “ The Blue Album , ” the band ’ s first , which wa big guitar , big harmonization , big falsetto , big emotion . It can still conjure sense memory of decade past — window down , crooning out into the forgiving dusk . Then there wa “ Pinkerton , ” which had , in addition to it big guitar and emotion , big weirdness about gender and race . I look back on my 18-year-old self belting out line like “ You are 18-year-old girl who live in small city of Japan , ” and have , if not regret , question . “ Pinkerton ” now seems like a raw , risky , sometimes repellent work of art , but one that earned it place in the age-old conversation about what is permitted by the artist .
 “ Can ’ t Knock the Hustle , ” on the other hand , sound like an insincere effort to start a conversation that nobody want to have , or at least that nobody want to have with Weezer . The band ’ s recent spate of cover , even the one that rise to the level of “ fun curiosity , ” feel like another race to the bottom in a cultural economy where attention matter more than anything else . ( “ Was it supposed to be funny ? ” I hear the new employee ask . )
 It ’ s not Weezer ’ s fault that I can ’ t let go of the past , but getting older is hard enough without Weezer making you feel it so acutely . “ Can ’ t Knock the Hustle ” fill me with a vague , general regret and an apprehension for what ’ s to come . As the song itself portends : “ The future ’ s so bright I got ta poke my eye out . ”

 What do you do when you can ’ t put off the future any more ?
 By RYAN BRADLEY
 A few year ago , Sharon Van Etten wa interviewing another musician — Mimi Parker , from the band Low — on the NPR program “ All Songs Considered. ” Van Etten , then in her mid-30s , wa thinking about having a kid and wanted to ask Parker , a mother of two , about what it would be like to be a mom and a touring musician at the same time .
 “ My music is the center of my world , ” Van Etten said while setting up a very big question : How doe someone — anyone , but especially an artist — make room in her life for her work , when her work might no longer be the center of her world ?
 “ You just figure it out , ” Parker answered .
 In the year that followed , Van Etten fell in love , pulled back from touring , enrolled in school to study psychology , wa cast for an acting part in the Netflix show “ The OA , ” wrote a movie score , gave birth ( a boy , now 2 ) — and in January released a new album , her first since 2014 .
 The album ’ s title — “ Remind Me Tomorrow ” — come from an Apple computer software-update alert option that Van Etten found herself selecting again and again , a perpetual prompt for something she needed to do and never quite got done . It ’ s a tidy summation of motherhood and artistry and the process of figuring them out , often at the same time , because , well , a lot of the figuring out seems to be figuring out what can wait until tomorrow .
 [ Read about the many life of Sharon Van Etten . ]
 The album ’ s cover is another reflection of ( or on ) this conflict : a photo of a room with two toddler in it , their stuff — toy , clothing , everything — spilled out around them . The image come from the filmmaker Katherine Dieckmann . ( It wa Dieckmann ’ s film “ Strange Weather ” that Van Etten scored . ) Those are Dieckmann ’ s kid amid the chaos . Van Etten recalled in a Vanity Fair interview that when she told Dieckmann she wa pregnant and worried about how she wa going to make motherhood work , Dieckmann pulled out her phone and pulled up the photo . “ You ’ ll figure it out , ” she said .
 “ Remind Me Tomorrow ” is about all the stuff that can ’ t be KonMari ’ d out of existence : life , love , the figuring , the delaying , and the fact that eventually , one day , but probably not today , the time will come to finally do the all those thing the “ remind me tomorrow ” prompt had so imperfectly kept at bay .
 The standout track , the song you want to raise up your fist and loosen your hip to , is “ Comeback Kid. ” It ’ s driving , then sweet , and it ’ s very stripped down . Every minor variation of the refrain seems to offer a new perspective . Sometimes when she sings it , Van Etten seems to be talking to an earlier version of herself , “ Come back , kid ! ” Other time , she ’ s talking about someone who is definitely not her : the comeback kid . In the video , Van Etten stand singing a old photo are projected onto her face and body and the wall behind her . The photo are from Van Etten ’ s past , but there ’ s very little that ’ s specific about them . They just look like the past in general . Which is probably the point : The past can be both particular and general , a her decision to use cover art featuring someone else ’ s kid might indicate .
 “ Comeback Kid ” is a song about glancing at our past self while dealing with the whole jumble of conflicting emotion that looking too closely at our past might dredge up . But mostly , it ’ s about the looking itself . It ’ s the looking that ’ s important . The world shift ; you look at the past ; you look at the future . And then what do you do ? You figure it out .

 A saxophone , a tuba and two drum kit combine to create a piece of music that somehow capture the whole history of jazz .
 By MARK RICHARDSON
 Listen closely to the third track from the 2018 studio album “ Your Queen Is a Reptile , ” by the London jazz outfit Sons of Kemet , and you will hear a tenor saxophone , a tuba and two drummer , all moving at great speed . The whole operation sound like four people piled into a wagon tumbling down a hill , just barely in control . Each element contributes equally . Because the bass come from an instrument powered by breath , the darting low end is le of a woofer-pumping presence and more of a song-within-a-song , a melody that you can hum on it own . The saxophone shout back , offering growling rhythmic line with just a pinch of melody . And the dueling drummer build one intensely syncopated beat from part of several — the foundational Caribbean rhythm of the Cuban tresillo , martial snare roll , pinging metallic percussion reminiscent of the roaring Afrobeat of Fela Kuti . Listen without knowing another thing about it , and this is a viscerally overwhelming piece of music .
 Widen the focus , though , and you will learn that the song is called “ My Queen Is Harriet Tubman , ” and that each song title on the album reference a heroic black woman who ha inspired the band ’ s leader , the London-born , Barbados-raised saxophone player Shabaka Hutchings . Maybe that knowledge give the burning intensity of the song — it feeling of joy streaked with struggle — a new dimension . Pull back further and take in Hutchings ’ s place a a central figure of one of this era ’ s most remarkable music scene , sometimes called New London Jazz — an approach that incorporates sound and style from all over the African diaspora , along with locally sourced ingredient from the British electronic underground . Let even more into the frame — say , that Hutchings ha performed with the Sun Ra Arkestra and is now signed to Impulse ! , the imprint that issued major work from artist including John Coltrane , Alice Coltrane and Pharoah Sanders — and then listen again to situate this music within the entire sweep of recorded jazz over the last 100 year .
 All this history is carried inside the song and transmitted by these master musician thorough their instrument . It ’ s a sax , a tuba and two drum kit . It ’ s a tune and an unforgettable beat . It ’ s a call to action and a command to find the dance floor . It ’ s a deeply political piece of music that say a great deal without uttering a word . It ’ s music of this exact moment , built from sound that have bounced back and forth across the Atlantic over century . Sounds that landed here , in a song honoring a woman whose face will , perhaps , on some future Sons of Kemet tour across the United States , be found on a $ 20 bill in Hutchings ’ s pocket , a queen ’ s visage replacing that of the dead president so admired by the current one .

 My mother-in-law wouldn ’ t tell u what our wedding gift would be — only that we ’ d have to travel to a forest , on an island , in Sweden , to receive it .
 By BRIAN REA
 When my wife and I were married , my mother-in-law told u she had a special gift for u . I wasn ’ t sure what to expect . She didn ’ t tell u what the gift wa , but she did tell u where it wa . In Sweden , on an island , in the forest .
 As with all magical place , getting to the island in Sweden requires some effort ( particularly a my wife , son and I live in Los Angeles ) . After the plane , the train and a car ride to the countryside , a boat ferry u across the lake from the mainland . There are only a handful of cottage — with no electricity or running water — on the island . It hasn ’ t been developed ( and , I hope , never will be ) . The forest service long ago gave over the island ’ s forest management to nature , so the place is thick with tree : gangly evergreen and white birch , a well a wildflower , blueberry plant and many others . The island is only about 50 acre , but it ’ s quite easy to get lost . Distances walking in the forest are hard to determine . You spend so much time walking over , under and around branch , brush and fallen tree that a simple hike can quickly become a disorienting journey . There are no straight line in a forest .
 In Sweden , mushroom are like gold . Specifically chanterelle mushroom . Aside from their high cost and their subtle earthy flavor ( cooked in butter and served on toast ) , their value is enhanced by how late in the season they grow . So Swedes are extremely protective of their chanterelle patch . And though the custom of allemansratten ( “ freedom to roam ” ) allows everyone access to walk and forage on all land , when a patch is discovered deep in the forest , people sometimes record the GPS coordinate and pas them down like a closely guarded secret .

 The day my mother-in-law took u for our first walk , everything seemed slow and quiet ( besides the buzz of the mosquito ) . I listened to her tell story of playing here a a child ; exploring it made me feel young , and nostalgic for a past I had never lived . I marched behind my wife and wa careful when stepping over fallen tree or catching branch she bent back to allow me to pas . I noticed too that color were brighter — particularly the striking golden-yellow chanterelle , whose unusual billowing shape sometimes reminded me of linen blowing on a clothesline or tiny version of Marilyn Monroe ’ s dress in “ The Seven Year Itch. ” Once I reoriented myself to searching like this , it became sport to find them . Some mushroom you can eat , and some can make you very sick . Animals know this , and people who spend lot of time in the forest know this . My mother-in-law know .
 I wasn ’ t sure how far we had walked , and I would not even have seen the path if it weren ’ t for my mother-in-law ’ s pointing it out . She took u to a clearing among some tree , looked around a bit , then stopped and bent down . She carefully pulled back some leaf and brush and said , “ This is for you. ” It wa a small patch of chanterelle mushroom : a cluster of about five or six undulating golden nugget jutting out of the dark , wet ground . She said she had given each of her child a patch in the forest where she found that mushroom consistently grew each year . “ Some year the animal get to them first , ” she said , “ but we ’ re lucky this year . ”
 It ’ s winter now , and we are back in Los Angeles . But I find myself thinking a lot about my mother-in-law ’ s gava , her gift — our tiny plot of mushroom . The quiet of the forest , maybe it ’ s snowing , maybe it ’ s dark . It ’ s strangely comforting to think of something so small and delicate and so far away — our small space alone on it island where we will return year after year .

 The travel guru belief the tiniest exposure to other culture will change Americans ’ entire life .
 By SAM ANDERSON
 Zachary Scott
 Rick Steves can tell you how to avoid having your pocket picked on the subway in Istanbul . He can tell you where to buy cooky from cloistered Spanish nun on a hilltop in Andalusia . He can tell you approximately what percentage of Russia ’ s gross domestic product come from bribery . He can teach you the magic idiom that unlocks perfectly complementary gelato flavor in Florence ( “ What marries well ? ” ) .
 But Rick Steves doe not know his way around New York City .
 “ In the Western Hemisphere , ” Steves told me one afternoon last March , “ I am a terrible traveler . ”
 We were , at that moment , very much inside the Western Hemisphere , 4,000 mile west of Rome , inching through Manhattan in a hired black car . Steves wa in the middle of a grueling speaking tour of the United States : 21 city in 34 day . New York wa stop No.17 . He had just flown in from Pittsburgh , where he had spent le than 24 hour , and he would soon be off to Los Angeles , Denver and Dallas . In his brief window of down time , Steves did not go out searching for quaint restaurant or architectural treasure . He sat alone in his hotel room , clacking away on his laptop , working on new project . His whole world , for the time being , had been reduced to a concrete blur of airport , hotel , lecture hall and medium appearance .
 In this town car , however , rolling through Midtown , Steves wa brimming with delight . He wa between a TV interview at the New York Stock Exchange and a podcast at CBS , and he seemed a enchanted by all the big-city bustle a the most wide-eyed tourist .
 “ Look at all the building ! ” he exclaimed . “ There ’ s so much energy ! Man , oh , man ! ”
 A woman crossed the street pushing two Yorkies in a stroller .


 “ How cute ! ” Steves shouted .
 The town car crawled toward a shabby metal hulk spanning the East River .
 “ Wow ! ” Steves said . “ Is that the Brooklyn Bridge ? ”
 It wa almost the opposite of the Brooklyn Bridge . The Brooklyn Bridge is one of the most recognizable structure in the world : a stretched stone cathedral . This wa it unloved upriver cousin , a tangle of discolored metal , vibrating with car , perpetually under construction . The driver told Steves that it wa the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge — or , a most New Yorkers still thought of it , the 59th Street Bridge .
 This revelation only increased Steves ’ s wonder .
 “ The 59th Street Bridge ! ” he said . “ That ’ s one of my favorite song ! ”
 With buoyant enthusiasm , Steves started to sing Simon and Garfunkel ’ s classic 1966 tune “ The 59th Street Bridge Song ( Feelin ’ Groovy ) . ”
 “ Slow down , you move too fast , ” he sang . “ You got to make the mornin ’ last — just — kickin ’ down the cobblestone . ... ”
 The car hit traffic and lurched to a stop . Steves paused to scan the street outside . “ Where are the cobblestone ? ” he asked . Then he refocused . He finished the song with a flourish : “ Lookin ’ for fun and feelin ’ — GROOOVYYYYYY ! ”
 There wa a silence in the car .
 “ Can you imagine those two guy walking around right here ? ” Steves said . “ Just feeling groovy ? Gosh , that ’ s cool . ”
 Steves pulled out his phone and , for his online fan , recorded a video of himself singing “ The 59th Street Bridge Song ( Feelin ’ Groovy ) . ”
 “ It ’ s fun to be in New York City , ” he signed off . “ Happy travel ! ”
 There wa another silence in the car , this one longer .
 “ You know , ” the driver said finally , “ you ’ re not very different than you are on your show . ”
 This wa correct . The driver wa referring to Steves ’ s long-running , widely syndicated , family-friendly public-television travel series , “ Rick Steves ’ Europe , ” on which Steves is a joyful and jaunty host , all eager-beaver smile and expressive head tilt . With a backpack over one shoulder and a hand tucked into his pocket , Steves gush poetically about England ’ s Lake District ( “ a lush land steeped in a rich brew of history , culture and nature ” ) and Erfurt , Germany ( “ this half-timbered medieval town with a shallow river gurgling through it center ” ) and Istanbul ( “ this sprawling metropolis on the Bosporus ” ) and Lisbon ( “ like San Francisco , but older and grittier and le expensive ” ) . He reclines jauntily atop the cliff of Dover and is vigorously scrubbed in a Turkish bath . The show ha aired now for nearly 20 year , and in that time , among traveler , Steves ha established himself a one of the legendary PBS superdorks — right there in the pantheon with Mr. Rogers , Bob Ross and Big Bird . Like them , Steves is a gentle soul who want to help you feel at home in the world . Like them , he seems miraculously untouched by the need to look cool , which of course make him sneakily cool . To the aspiring traveler , Steves is a inspirational a Julia Child once wa to the aspiring home chef .
 [ Read a profile of Terry Gross , the host of “ Fresh Air . ” ]
 Eventually , Steves ’ s busy New York day ended on the Upper East Side , where he wa scheduled to give a talk at a Barnes & Noble . As we drove to the event , Steves confessed that he wasn ’ t sure what kind of crowd he would get . You never knew exactly where his Rickniks ( a the hard-core fan call themselves ) would materialize en masse . Some Steves appearance were mobbed ; others were sparse . His appeal is slightly cultish . For every Ricknik out in the world , a large contingent of average people have no idea who he is .
 I wa mildly skeptical about Steves ’ s drawing power in New York . It wa hard to imagine a bunch of cynical , worldly , urban , polyglot , multicultural East Coast sophisticate — people who probably vacationed at deconsecrated eco-hostels in Oman or Madagascar — getting excited about public television ’ s reigning expert on Europe .
 We arrived , however , to find the bookstore overflowing . A solid wave of applause met Steves at the door . Fans had been pouring in , the organizer told u , for two solid hour . People sat in the aisle and stood in the back . Some wore T-shirts and hat bearing the Rick Steves slogan : “ Keep on Travelin ’ . ” The crowd ’ s body heat overwhelmed the building ’ s climate control .
 I noticed a group of hipster 20-somethings standing near the back , and at first I assumed they had all come sarcastically . But a Steves began to speak , they grinned and laughed with absolute earnestness . Everyone here wa , apparently , a superfan . At one point , Steves showed a slide of tourist swimming in a sunny French river underneath a Roman aqueduct , and the whole crowd gasped . When he mentioned that his website featured a special video devoted to packing light for woman , a woman in the crowd actually pumped her fist .
 At the end of his talk , Steves offered to sign book — but not in the traditional way . There were too many people for a signing table , he said , and anyway , single-file line were always inefficient . ( This is one of his travel credo : avoid waiting in line . ) Instead of sitting down , Steves walked out into the center of the room and invited everyone to open their book and surround him . He pulled out a Sharpie . And then he started to spin . Steves held out his pen and signed book after book after book , fluidly , on the move , smiling a the crowd pressed in . “ We went to Portugal on our honeymoon , ” a man shouted . “ How romantic ! ” Steves answered , still spinning . A woman asked him where to celebrate Christmas in Europe . Steves , in midrotation , still signing furiously , told her that he had made a whole special about precisely that question and that it wa available free on his website . “ Keep on travelin ’ , Rick ! ” someone shouted . “ Keep on travelin ’ ! ” Steves shouted back . As he spun , Steves thanked everyone and gave quick , off-the-cuff advice . In an astonishingly short time , he had signed every book . The people were satisfied . The crowd thinned . Steves finally came to a stop .
 Rick Steves is absolutely American . He wear jean every single day . He drink frozen orange juice from a can . He like his hash brown burned , his coffee extra hot . He dislike most fancy restaurant ; when he ’ s on the road , he prefers to buy a foot-long Subway sandwich and split it between lunch and dinner . He ha a great spontaneous honk of a laugh — it burst out of him , when he is truly delighted , with the sharpness of a firecracker on the Fourth of July . Steves is so completely American that when you stop to really look at his name , you realize it ’ s just the name Rick followed by the plural of Steve — that he is a one-man crowd of absolutely regular everyday American guy : one Rick , many Steves . Although Steves spends nearly half his life traveling , he insists , passionately , that he would never live anywhere but the United States — and you know when he say it that this is absolutely true . In fact , Steves still life in the small Seattle suburb where he grew up , and every morning he walk to work on the same block , downtown , where his parent owned a piano store 50 year ago . On Sundays , Steves wear his jean to church , where he play the conga , with great arm-pumping spirit , in the inspirational soft-rock band that serenade the congregation before the service start , and then he sits down and sings classic Lutheran hymn without even needing to refer to the hymnal . Although Steves ha published many foreign-language phrase book , the only language he speaks fluently is English . He built his business in America , raised his kid in America and give frequent loving paean to the glory of American life .
 And yet : Rick Steves desperately want you to leave America . The tiniest exposure to the outside world , he belief , will change your entire life . Travel , Steves like to say , “ wallop your ethnocentricity ” and “ carbonate your experience ” and “ rearranges your cultural furniture. ” Like sealed window on a hot day , a nation ’ s border can be stultifying . Steves want to crack them open , to let humanity ’ s breeze circulate . The more rootedly American you are , the more Rick Steves want this for you . If you have never had a passport , if you are afraid of the world , if your family would prefer to vacation exclusively at Walt Disney World , if you worry that foreigner are rude and predatory and prone to violence or at least that their food will give you diarrhea , then Steves want you — especially you — to go to Europe . Then he want you to go beyond . ( For a majority of his audience , Steves say , “ Europe is the wading pool for world exploration. ” ) Perhaps , like him , you will need large headphone and half a tab of Ambien to properly relax on the flight , but Steves want you to know that it will be worth it . He want you to stand and make little moaning sound on a cobblestone street the first time you taste authentic Italian gelato — flavor so pure they seem like the primordial essence of peach or melon or pistachio or rice distilled into molecule and stirred directly into your own molecule . He want you to hike on a dirt path along a cliff over the almost-too-blue Mediterranean , with village and vineyard spilling down the rugged mountain above you . He want you to arrive at the Parthenon at dusk , just before it close , when all the tour group are loading back onto their cruise ship , so that you have the whole place to yourself and can stand there feeling like a private witness to the birth , and then the ruination , of Western civilization .
 Steves want you to go to Europe for a long a you can afford to , and he also want to help you afford it . ( Much of his guru energy is focused on cutting cost . ) He want you to go a many time a possible , and while you ’ re there , he want you to get way down deep into the culture , to eat with local in the teeming market , to make a sympathetic fool of yourself , to get entirely lost in your lack of America .
 Out of this paradoxical desire — the enlightenment of Americans through their extraction from America — Steves ha built his quirky travel empire . His guidebook , which started a hand-typed and photocopied information packet for his scraggly 1970s tour group , now dominate the American market ; their distinctive blue-and-yellow spine brighten the travel section of bookstore everywhere . Steves is le interested in reaching sophisticated traveler than he is in converting the uninitiated . ( “ There will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents , ” the Bible tell u , “ than over 99 righteous person who do not need to repent. ” ) Last year , his company led close to 30,000 paying customer on dozen of elaborate European itinerary . Steves teach his follower everything from how to pack a toiletry kit to how to make themselves at home in a small hotel room to how to appreciate a religious tradition they may have been raised to despise . ( In order to enjoy St. Peter ’ s Basilica , Steves admits , he had to learn to “ park my Protestant sword at the door. ” ) He is a sort of spiritual travel agent for America ’ s curious but hesitant middle class . He is simultaneously goofy and dead serious ; he can ping , in an instant , from golly-gee Pollyanna cheerfulness to deep critique of the modern world . In a series of long , affectionate , candid conversation , Steves ’ s colleague described him to me using the word “ sophomoric , ” “ knucklehead ” and “ Santa Claus ” — but also “ juggernaut , ” “ evangelical ” and “ revolutionary. ” Rick Steves want u to travel because it ’ s fun , yes , but also because he belief it might actually save the world .
 I can testify , firsthand , to the power of Rick Steves . In 1998 , he spoke at my college . Nothing about the encounter seemed promising . Our campus wa a tiny outpost in a tiny town , and Steves delivered his talk not in some grand lecture hall but in a drab room in the basement of the student union . I wa poor , shy , anxious , sheltered , repressed and extremely pale . I wa a particular kind of Pacific Northwest white guy — blind to myself and my place in the world . I had never really traveled ; I wa more comfortable on Greyhound bus than on airplane . Going to Europe seemed like something aristocrat did , like fox hunting or debutante ball .
 My girlfriend dragged me to the talk . I had never even heard of Steves . He entered looking like the kind of guy who would bring an acoustic guitar to every single church picnic within a two-hour radius of his favorite Applebee ’ s : large glass , floppy hair , bluejeans , wholesome grin . But what he said over the next hour or so changed the rest of my life .
 It ’ s hard to describe how thoroughly energized Steves becomes in front of a crowd . He pace , gesticulates and speaks very fast . He tell his favorite old joke a if they were eternally new . ( “ Eet smell like zee foot of angel , ” the French cheesemonger always exclaims . ) Onstage , he is a combination of preacher , comedian , salesman , life-hacker , professor and inspirational speaker . Steves told u , that day , how to pack our entire life into a single bag measuring 9 by 22 by 14 inch . ( “ It ’ s enlightened to pack light , ” Steves insists . “ It ’ s a blessing to pack light. ” ) He told u how to find excellent cheap hotel , how to survive on minimalist picnic in public park , how to wash clothing in bathroom sink and how to make friend without sharing a language . Steves ’ s signature book , “ Europe Through the Back Door , ” seemed le like a travel philosophy than a whole mode of being : scrappy , prepared , independent , extroverted . Europe ’ s front door , he told u , wa positioned to feed traveler directly into exploitation : overpriced cafe , trinket shop , long line , corporate high-rise hotel . The back door , by contrast , led to revelation . He showed u impossibly enticing photo : cobblestone piazza teeming with fruit stall , quirky wooden hotel among wildflower in the Alps , vast arsenal of multicolored cheese . He made travel seem le like a luxury than a necessary exploration of the self , a civic responsibility , a basic courtesy to your fellow human . It seemed almost unreasonable not to go . Above all , Steves told u , do not be afraid . The people of the world are wonderful , and the planet we share is spectacular . But the only way to really understand that is to go and see it for yourself . So go .
 My girlfriend and I left the room convert to the gospel of Rick Steves . We bought his book and highlighted it to near-meaninglessness . We started mapping itinerary , squirreling away money , asking relative for donation . ( In probably the worst phone call of my life , my rancher grandfather expressed shock and dismay that I would ask him to support this meaningless overseas lark . ) Eventually , over many month , we scraped together just enough to buy plane ticket and order minimalist Steves-approved supply , including a travel towel so thin and nonabsorbent that it seemed to just push the moisture around your skin until you forgot you were wet . We packed exactly a Steves taught u : T-shirts rolled into space-saving noodle , just enough clothes to get u from one hotel laundry session to the next . Then , for the first time in our life , we left North America .
 One of Steves ’ s strongest recommendation is to keep a journal . Mine wa so corny that it cover actually said “ A TRAVELER ’ S NOTEBOOK ” over a picture of the Eiffel Tower . When I opened it recently , the reality of that long-ago trip hissed out with fresh urgency . My 20-year-old self recorded everything . On our first day in Europe , we bought imported Austrian apple with fat , heavy English coin and saw a woman stumble on a staircase , breaking an entire bag of newly bought china . We arrived at our first hostel , the Y.M.C.A . in Bath , to find a man urinating in the stairwell — so we kept walking until we happened into a nearby churchyard , where the gravestone were so old and thin they were almost translucent . As we tried to make out the name of the dead , songbird sang strenuously in the tree all around u . This juxtaposition — old death , new life — blew my jet-lagged American mind . “ Already , after just one day in Bath , ” I wrote in my journal , “ the world ha grown firmer . Reality fill it gap . ”
 That , more or le , wa the theme of the trip . For six week , we followed the Steves game plan . We shared squalid bunk with other young traveler from Denmark , Australia , Canada and Japan . In the stately public park of Paris , we ate rotisserie chicken with our bare hand . One stifling afternoon at the Colosseum in Rome , we watched a worker slam his ladder against the edge of an arch and break off some ancient brick . ( He looked over at u , looked down at the brick , kicked dirt over them and kept working . ) We were moved by Van Gogh , Picasso and Gaudí , but unmoved by Versailles ( “ more vain than beautiful , ” I wrote ) , bullfighting ( “ more brutal than artful ” ) and Goya ( “ vague and blurry ” ) . Once , I left my underwear on a Mediterranean beach overnight and , since I could not afford to lose a pair , had to go back and pick it up the next day , in full view of all the sunbather .
 Wherever we went , Rick Steves wa with u . In my journal , I referred to him half-jokingly a our “ worldly uncle and guiding light , ” and a we walked around , I annoyed my girlfriend by doing impression of him . We seemed to have entered the world of his slide : the fruit market and overnight train , the sunny French river under the ancient Roman aqueduct . Sometimes our European host , with the quiet pride of someone who once met Elvis , told u story about Steves . He wa a gentleman , they said , a truly good man , and he always came in person to check out their hotel , and he never failed to ask them how their child were doing .
 By the end of our trip , we were completely broke . We couldn ’ t afford even a baguette on our last day in Paris . We flew home looking ragged , shaggy , weather-beaten and exhausted .


 But of course Steves wa right : Our life were never the same . We were still young Americans , but we felt liberated and empowered , like true citizen of the world . The most important thing we learned all had to do with home . As the English writer G.K. Chesterton once put it , in a quote I found printed in my corny old travel journal : “ The whole object of travel is not to set foot on foreign land ; it is at last to set foot on one ’ s own country a a foreign land. ” After looking at a Roman stone wall topped by a Saxon stone wall topped by a medieval English wall next to a modern paved street , I began to see what a thin crust of national history the United States actually stand on . I began to realize how silly and narrow our notion of exceptionalism is — this impulse to consider ourselves somehow immune to the force that shape the rest of the world . The environment I grew up in , with it mall and freeway , it fantasy of heroic individualism , began to seem unnatural . I started to sense how much reality exists elsewhere in the world — not just in a theoretical sense , in book and movie , but with the full urgent weight of the real . And not just in Europe but on every other continent , all the time , forever . I began to realize how much I still had to learn before I could pretend to understand anything . Not everyone need Steves ’ s help to get to this point . Some people get there themselves , or their community help them . But I needed him , and I am eternally glad I wa dragged that day to see him talk .
 [ How to eat in Venice like a Venetian . ]
 Steves answered his front door slightly distracted . I had come in the middle of his breakfast preparation . He wa stirring a block of frozen orange juice into a pitcher of water . “ Freshly squeezed from the can ! ” he quipped . This wa April 2018 , exactly 20 year after my first trip to Europe . I had come to see Steves in the most exotic place possible : his home . He life just north of Seattle , in a town so rainy it ha a free umbrella-share program . There is nothing particularly exotic about the house itself . It ha beige carpeting , professionally trimmed shrub and a back deck with a hot tub . What wa exotic wa simply that Steves wa there . He had just returned from his frenetic speaking tour of the United States and would be leaving almost immediately on his annual trip to Europe . For now , he wa making breakfast : frozen blueberry , Kashi cereal , O.J . “ I would eat this every day for the rest of my life if I could , ” he said .
 But of course , he could not . Steves is gone too much , yo-yoing between the misty forest of the Pacific Northwest and the sun-baked cathedral of Europe . Every year , no matter what else is going on , Steves spends at least four month practicing the kind of travel he ha preached for 40-odd year : hauling his backpack up narrow staircase in cheap hotel , washing his clothes in sink , improvising picnic .
 He is now 63 , and he could afford to retire many time over . But he doesn ’ t have the metabolism for sitting around . Among his colleague , Steves is a notorious workaholic . After grueling day of filming in Europe , he ha been known to slip script revision under the crew ’ s door at 2 a.m. , and then to ask them , at breakfast , for their feedback . On long car ride , he sits in the back seat and type op-eds on his laptop . His relentless hands-on control of every aspect of his business is what ha distinguished the Rick Steves brand .
 It is also , obviously , exhausting — if not for Steves , then at least for the people around him . He ha two child , now grown , and for much of their childhood , Steves wa gone . He wa building his company , changing the world . For very long stretch , his wife wa forced to be a single mother . ( She and Steves divorced in 2010 after 25 year of marriage . ) Every summer , when the family joined Steves in Europe , his pace hardly slackened : They would cover major city in 48 hour , blitzing through huge museum back to back . The kid complained so much , on one trip , that Steves finally snapped — if they were so miserable , he said , they could just go sit in the hotel room all day and play video game . They remember this day a heaven . One year , while Steves wa away , the child converted to Catholicism . His son , Andy Steves , eventually went into the family business : He now work a a tour guide and even published a European guidebook .
 Steves is fully aware that his obsessive work ethic is unusual . He admits that he ha regret . But he can not make himself stop . He ha the fervor of the true evangelist : The more people he meet , the more city he visit , the more life he might change . At one point , a we talked , he pulled out the itinerary for his coming trip — from Sicily to Iceland , with no down time whatsoever . Just looking at it made him giddy . I asked why he couldn ’ t ease up slightly — maybe just spend two month in Europe , maybe just speak in 10 American city .
 “ It ’ s a strange thing , ” he said . “ I get energy from it . It ’ s like I ’ m breathing straight oxygen . What would I do if I stayed home ? Not much . Nothing I would remember . ”
 In his house , Steves offered up a little show and tell . He pointed out an antique silver cigarette lighter shaped like the Space Needle . He sat down at his baby grand piano and lost himself , for a few happy minute , playing Scarlatti . He took me to a room filled with book and reached up to a very high shelf . “ I don ’ t show this to too many people , ” he said , “ because they ’ ll think I ’ m nuts. ” Steves pulled down a thick red binder , the content of which were , indeed , pretty nutty . When Steves wa 13 , he decided , for no apparent reason , to conduct a deep statistical analysis of the 1968 Billboard pop chart . Every week , he would clip the ranking out of his local newspaper and , using a point system of his own devising , graph the top band ’ success on sheet of gridded paper . The line were multicolored and interwoven — it looked like the subway map of some fantastical foreign city . You could see , at a glance , the rising and falling fortune of the Beatles ( red ) and Creedence Clearwater Revival ( black ) and Elvis Presley ( dot and dash ) . Steves kept this up for three year , taping together many piece of graph paper , and in the end he summarized the data in an authoritative-looking table that he typed on the family typewriter . This is what wa in that binder : a systematic breakdown of the most successful band from 1968 to 1970 , a determined by the objective statistic of an analytical adolescent weirdo . ( The winner , of course , were the Beatles — 1,739 point — followed by Creedence , Simon and Garfunkel , Neil Diamond . )
 Steves laughed . It wa ridiculous . But it wa also a perfect window into his mind . Even at 13 , a powerful energy wa coiled inside him — an unusual combination of obsession and precision , just waiting for some worthwhile project to burst out in .
 And that , coincidentally , wa exactly when he found it : the project of his life . In the summer of 1969 , when Steves wa 14 , his parent took him to Europe . They owned a business tuning and importing piano , and they wanted to see factory firsthand . Steves approached this first trip abroad with the same meticulous energy he brought to his Billboard graph . As he traveled around the continent , he recorded the essential data of his journey on the back of postcard : location , activity , weather , expense . One day , Steves spent 40 cent on fishing gear . Another , he met a 79-year-old man who had witnessed the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand . To keep everything in order , Steves numbered the postcard sequentially . He still ha them all packed lovingly into an old wooden box .
 On that same formative trip , the Steves family visited relative in Norway . They happened to be there in July 1969 , when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon . “ Ett lite skritt for et menneske , ” the television said , “ ett stort sprang for menneskeheten. ” In that moment , in that strange place , young Rick Steves felt the concept of “ menneskeheten ” — “ mankind ” — at a depth he never would have been able to access back home . Europe wa a crash course in cultural relativity . In a park in Oslo , he had an epiphany : The foreign human around him , he realized , were leading existence every bit a rich and full a his own . “ Right there , ” he would write later , “ my 14-year-old egocentric worldview took a huge hit. ” A life-changing realization clicked into place . “ This planet must be home to billion of equally lovable child of God . ”
 That first trip set the course for everything that followed . When Steves wa 18 , he went back to Europe without his parent . Soon , life in America became a series of interlude between travel . He taught piano to earn money , then stretched that money a far a he possibly could , sleeping on church pew and park bench , in empty barn and construction zone , from Western Europe to Afghanistan . He turned his cheapness into a science . Instead of paying for a hotel room in a city , Steves would use his Railpass and sleep on a train for the night — four hour out , four hour back . He would stuff himself on free breakfast bread , then try to eat a little a possible for the rest of the day . Naturally , he recorded all this , and today he ha an impressive archive of old travel journal . Their page preserve , in tiny handwriting , shadowy young dissident in Moscow , diarrhea in Bulgaria , revolution in Nicaragua .
 In his 20 , Steves brought his wide-roaming wisdom back to the United States . He started to supplement his piano teaching with travel seminar . His signature class , European Travel Cheap , ran for six hour . Steves could have talked longer than that , but it struck him a impractical for his student . In Europe , he rented a nine-seat minibus and started to lead small tour . Eventually , his seminar and tour note morphed into his book . The first edition of “ Europe Through the Back Door , ” published in 1980 , wa typed on a rented IBM Selectric . It had no ISBN and looked so amateurish that bookstore assumed it wa an early review copy . “ Anyone caught reprinting any material herein for any purpose whatsoever will be thanked profusely , ” it said . This wa the birth of the Rick Steves empire .
 Rick Steves both is and is not his TV persona . Offscreen , he allows himself to be much more explicitly political . He ha the passion of the autodidact . Growing up , Steves led a relatively sheltered existence : He wa a white , comfortable , middle-class baby boomer in a white , comfortable , middle-class pocket of America . Travel did for him what he promise it will do for everyone else : It put him in contact with other reality . He saw desperate poverty in Iran and became obsessed with economic injustice . He started searching for answer in book , scribbling note in the margin of “ Bread for the World , ” by Arthur Simon , and “ The Origins of Totalitarianism , ” by Hannah Arendt . He studied the war industry and colonial exploitation . The first time Steves traveled to Central America , he came back so outraged that he wrote a fiery tract called “ There ’ s Blood on Your Banana , ” then flew to Washington and hand-delivered a copy to the office of every member of Congress .
 In the early day , Steves injected political lesson into his European tour . Sometimes he would arrive in a city with no hotel reservation , just to make his privileged customer feel the anxiety of homelessness . In Munich , he would set up camp in an infamous hippie circus tent , among all the countercultural wanderer of Europe .
 Today , Steves is more strategic . His most powerful tool , he realizes , is his broad appeal . He ha an uncanny knack for making serious criticism feel gentle and friendly . Often he disguise critique of America with a rhetorical move that I like to think of a “ U.S.A. ! U.S.A. ! U.S.A. ! ( But . ... ) ” “ I ’ m unapologetically proud to be an American , ” he writes in the introduction to his book “ Travel a a Political Act. ” “ The happiest day of any trip is the day I come home . ... But other nation have some pretty good idea too . ”
 That ’ s when he hit his audience with legal prostitution , high tax rate and universal health care .
 When I asked Steves about this strategy , he chuckled .
 “ It ’ s not America-bashing , ” he said . “ It ’ s America-loving . I think it ’ s loving America to look at it critically . But you ’ ve got to set it up . You ’ ve got to allay people ’ s concern that you ’ re a communist . So you explain to them : I ’ m a capitalist , I make a lot of money , I employ a lot of people , I love the law of supply and demand . It seems kind of silly , but you ’ ve got to say that . Then , especially the husband who are dragged there by their wife , they go , ‘ I thought he wa a commie , but he ’ s O.K. ’ And then you don ’ t need to be too gentle . You can confront people with a different perspective , and you ’ ll get through . ”
 Steves learned this strategy , he said , from his early day running tour , living with the same people for week at a time . Survival required being pleasant . People didn ’ t want grating lecture about America ’ s shortcoming — even if that wa sometimes his instinct . Instead , he pointed out different perspective with a smile . He became fluent in the need of American tourist . “ I know what their button are , ” he said . “ I know what their attention span is . I don ’ t want to just preach to the choir . I want to preach to organization that need to hear this , so I need to compromise a little bit so the gatekeeper let it through to their world . ”
 This balancing act ha become increasingly difficult over the past two decade , in a world of terrorism , war , nationalism and metastasizing partisanship . After the Sept. 11 attack , most travel company anticipated that the bottom wa about to fall out of the market . They canceled tour and cut back budget . Steves , however , remained defiantly optimistic . He promised his staff that there would be no cut , no layoff and no shift in message . He insisted that a world in crisis needed travel more , not le . Soon the shock of Sept. 11 turned into the Iraq war , which strained the relationship between the United States and even it closest European ally , sending the travel industry deeper into it trough . In his hometown , Steves caused a controversy when he walked around removing row of American flag that had been set up in support of the war . It wa , he argued , an act of patriotism : The flag is meant to represent all Americans , not just war supporter . “ I wa shark-bait on Seattle ’ s right-wing radio talk show for several day , ” he wrote .
 Lately , Steves concedes , his political message ha begun to take over his teaching . In “ Travel a a Political Act , ” the familiar element of his guidebook — walking tour , museum guide , hotel review — are replaced by rabble-rousing cultural critique . Steves express deep admiration for Scandinavian-style social democracy and call out many of America ’ s fault : our addiction to car and gun and mass incarceration ; our deference to corporation ; our long history of cultural imperialism ( “ one of the ugliest thing one nation can do is write another nation ’ s textbook ” ) . Some moment in the book verge on un-American . “ Sometimes , when I ’ m frustrated with the impact of American foreign policy on the developing world , ” Steves writes , “ I have this feeling that an impotent America is better for the world than an America whose power isn ’ t always used for good . ”
 Occasionally , despite his best effort , Steves still ruffle feather . Recent TV special have covered Iran — “ I believe if you ’ re going to bomb a place , ” Steves ha written , “ you should know it people first ” — and the rise of fascism in Europe . In a special about the Holy Land , Steves refers unapologetically to “ Palestine ” instead of “ the West Bank ” or “ Palestinian territory ” ; some viewer were so outraged that they told Steves they were removing PBS from their will . After one recent speech in the Deep South , event organizer refused to pay Steves — their conservative sponsor , he learned , considered his message a form of liberal propaganda .
 In recent year , Steves ha become a happy warrior for an unlikely cause : the legalization of marijuana . He first tried the drug in Afghanistan , in the 1970s , in the name of cultural immersion , and he wa fascinated by it effect on his mind . Today , he is a board member of Norml , the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws , and a regular speaker at Hempfest . In his headquarters you will find a poster of the Mona Lisa holding a gargantuan spliff . In 2012 , Steves campaigned hard for Washington State ’ s successful legalization initiative , and since then he ha barnstormed other state ( Oregon , Maine , Vermont and more ) to make sure the civil liberty are properly passed around . On a shelf in his living room , right there among all the European knickknack , Steves display a sizable bong .
 Sometimes , fan urge Steves to run for office . When I asked him if he would ever get into politics , he had an answer ready : “ I already am. ” Good travel teaching , in his eye , is inherently political . To stay in a family-owned hotel in Bulgaria is to strengthen global democracy ; to pack light is to break the iron logic of consumerism ; to ride a train across Europe is to challenge the fossil-fuel industry . Travel , to Steves , is not some frivolous luxury — it is an engine for improving humankind , for connecting people and removing their prejudice , for knocking distant culture together to make unlikely spark of joy and insight . Given that million of people have encountered the work of Steves over the last 40 year , on TV or online or in his guidebook , and that they have carried those lesson to untold other million of people , it is fair to say that his life ’ s work ha had a real effect on the collective life of our planet . When people tell Steves to stay out of politics , to stick to travel , he can only laugh .
 “ It ’ s flattering to think I could run for office , ” he admitted . “ And it would be exciting . But I think I ’ m accomplishing more right now than I would in office , and I ’ m having more fun . I ’ m skiing with beautiful wax on my ski . When I want to do something , I can do it . ”
 Steves is deeply indifferent to creature comfort . When I visited him , the back seat of his car wa covered with a greenish slime , practically disintegrating , because of a mysterious leak . He just cracked the window to try to dry it out . Steves prefers to spend his money on his favorite cause . His activism can be quirky and impulsive . In 2011 , after hearing that his local symphony orchestra wa struggling , he stepped in with a gift of $ 1 million , spread over 10 year , to help keep it operating . ( This , pointedly , wa how much money he would get back from President George W. Bush ’ s tax cut over a decade . ) Last year , during a chat with one of the national leader of the Lutheran Church , Steves wondered how much it would cost to send every single Lutheran congregation in the United States a DVD of his recent TV special about Martin Luther . It wa something like $ 30,000 ; Steves happily wrote the check . In the 1990s , working in partnership with the Y.W.C.A. , he started investing his retirement saving in local real estate in order to house homeless mother and their child . The plan wa to take that money out of the banking system and let it do a few decade of social good , at which point Steves could sell the building to fund his retirement . Eventually he worked his way up to buying a whole 24-unit apartment complex — and then he donated it outright to the Y.W.C.A . The mother , he said , needed it more than he would .
 Steves is obsessed with the problem of poverty and amazed at our perpetual misunderstanding of it . “ It ’ s not just : You screwed up , so you ’ re poor , ” he said . “ There ’ s a structure that keep half of humanity poor . This need to be talked about . I can do it , and I can get away with it. ” His next TV special , in production now , will investigate extreme poverty and hunger through two very different non-European country : Guatemala and Ethiopia . In the meantime , all the royalty of his latest book — an updated edition of “ Travel a a Political Act ” — are being donated to Bread for the World , an organization that lobby on behalf of hungry people . He is working on making his company ’ s tour completely carbon-neutral .
 “ If I wa trying to build a career on the speaking circuit — if I wa struggling , and I needed these gig — I would not talk about that stuff , ” he said . “ I could just talk about light stuff , and everybody would love it . But I ’ m not working right now to do that . I ’ m not trying to get anywhere that I ’ m not already . I don ’ t need to be anything I ’ m not . I ’ m 63 year old . I could retire now . But I ’ m ramping up . ”
 Indeed , Steves ’ s business ha been booming . Once the travel market finally recovered , some year after Sept. 11 , Steves occupied a disproportionately big share of it — precisely because he had refused to scale back . By taking a principled stand , Steves flourished . Today , his chipper voice is reaching more Americans than ever . “ Fear , ” a Steves like to say , “ is for people who don ’ t get out very much . ”
 [ 4 stop for a woman-focused trip to Seoul . ]
 One night , in his living room , Steves pulled out a plain black notebook . “ Here ’ s something you might find interesting , ” he said with his trademark cheer , and he flipped open to a random page and prepared to read aloud . I wa familiar , by then , with Steves ’ s deep archive of old travel journal , and so I settled in to listen to further adventure from 1975 Moscow or 1997 Paris . This , however , wa something else entirely — a record of a very different kind of journey .
 “ Getting high , ” Steves read , “ release the human in me . ”
 “ Intelligence is a rubber band , ” he continued . “ Getting high is stretching it . ”
 I wa sitting in the beige living room of America ’ s foremost travel guru , underneath framed reproduction of popular European masterworks , and my mind wa about to be well and truly blown . For the next 20 minute , Steves would read me koan about the glory of being stoned .
 “ High is the present , ” he read .
 “ When you ’ re high , you debate long and hard over whether to put on your sweater or turn up the heat . ”
 This journal , Steves explained , contained what he called his “ High Notes. ” For nearly 40 year , he had been writing in it exclusively after smoking marijuana . He would get baked , open up to somewhere in the middle and jot down whatever he happened to be thinking — deep or shallow , silly or angry . There is no chronology ; on every page , axiom from many different decade commingle . It is a lifelong treasury of Steves ’ s stoner thought .
 He continued to read .
 “ As soon a I stop mattering so much , I ’ ll be happier . ”
 “ A baby doesn ’ t know if the hanging is on the wall or if the wall is on the hanging . ”
 “ Make a rug with vacuum mark , so it always look freshly vacuumed . ”
 The entry covered an impressively wide territory . Some were little shred of oracular poetry ( “ We all have a divine harness ” ) , while others were dashed-off semi-witticisms ( “ Wolfgang von Bewildered ” ) or bitter social critique ( “ The spiritual cesspool of America — our shopping mall ” ) . “ They don ’ t let you into heaven without callus on your soul , ” he read at one point . “ Suffer or weep. ” There were scrap of humorous dialogue ( “ ‘ Nothing is wrong with an ego ! ’ he bellowed ” ) and sentence that would have made great bumper sticker on rusting VW bus : “ I ’ d like to be quarantined from reality . ”
 I found myself wondering , for the thousandth time : Who doe this ? What kind of mind not only think of such a project but actually follows through with it , decade after decade after decade ? Who , for God ’ s sake , is this disciplined when they ’ re high ?
 As Steves read , he interrupted himself again and again with great shouting honk of laughter , and I cackled right along with him . Then , suddenly , with almost no transition , we would find ourselves deep in earnest conversation about the nature of true happiness or the danger of ambition . And then we would suddenly be cackling again . We were , in other word , getting high on Steves ’ s “ High Notes . ”
 He kept reading .
 “ I ’ ve been craning my mind to see you , ” he said .
 “ I feel like a hungry bird , but I won ’ t eat any worm I don ’ t like . ”
 Steves showed me complex analytical graph about true love and divorce rate , about the way music sound when you ’ re high versus sober , about the degree of honesty possible with the various people in your life . ( “ Scale of Unconditional Regard , ” this last one wa called . ) One page of the journal had a strand of hair taped to it , labeled “ split end. ” There wa a drawing of a woman ’ s breast . And of course there were many , many more description of getting high itself . “ Getting high is like roasting an English muffin , ” Steves read . “ You start out cold and doughy , and you toast it to a crisp brown , and just a little more and you get all black and burned . ”
 At some point , he looked up from the journal . “ To me , ” he said , “ this is a precious thing . Because this is me . ”
 He kept reading .
 “ Time spent socially is time spent at the expense of personal betterment , ” he said .
 He shook his head . That ’ s how he had thought when he wa young . “ That ’ s my problem , ” he added ruefully . “ I work all the time . ”
 Then he kept reading .
 “ When I die , ” he read , “ scatter me all over the budget hotel of Europe . ”

 A weeklong trip in Alaska wa supposed to be an adventure . In an instant , it became the experience that defined u all .
 By JON MOOALLEM
 DAVID BENJAMIN SHERRY
 The whale sighting happened right away , minute into Day 1 . Jon , Dave and I had just been dropped off on a remote Alaskan shoreline , an hour and a half by boat from the closest speck of a town . Jon wa working a a sea-kayaking guide that summer in Glacier Bay National Park , and he had invited u up for a seven-day excursion during his week off . As the boat that delivered u vanished , the drone of it engine dampening into a murmur and then finally trailing off , it became unthinkably quiet on the beach , and the largeness and strangeness of our surroundings were suddenly apparent . It wa a familiar phenomenon for Jon from the start of all his trip : a moment that people instinctually paused to soak in . To me , it felt like those scene of astronaut who , having finally rattled free of the earth ’ s atmosphere , slip into the stillness of space . Except we weren ’ t in space . We were on earth — finally , really on earth .
 We were only starting to move around again , packing our gear into the kayak , when we heard the first huff of a blowhole , not far offshore .
 Jon wa ecstatic . It seemed to him a if the animal were putting on a show , swimming playfully in the kelp , diving , resurfacing , then plowing it open mouth across the surface to feed . He took it a a good omen . Though I had no idea at the time , he wa anxious that Dave and I might feel intimidated about making the trip ; such a big payoff , so quickly , would get u excited and defuse any apprehension .
 For Dave , the whale-sighting had exactly the opposite effect . Once , when he wa a kid , his dad took him scuba diving with dolphin . They were friendly , awe-inspiring creature , purportedly , but they terrified Dave instead . He could still conjure the feeling of hanging defenselessly in that water while the animal deftly swirled around him , le like solid object than flash of reflected light , while he could move only in comparative slow-motion . Ever since , he had harbored a fear of large sea creature — a niche phobia , particularly for a young man who lived in the Bronx , but a genuine one still . And so , even a Dave understood that a chance to see whale up close like this wa a major draw of a kayaking trip in Alaska , and though he feigned being thrilled , some second thought were kicking in : We were going out there , he realized .
 The whale left me exhilarated and gleeful , like Jon ; but deeper down , I also remember feeling shaken , like Dave . Nothing about the animal registered to me a playful or welcoming . It just appeared in the distance , then transited quickly past u , from left to right . My uneasiness had something to do with the whale ’ s great size and indifference — it obliviousness — a it passed . Watching it made me feel profoundly out of place and register how large that wilderness wa , relative to me .
 At the time , I wa working at a literary magazine in New York City called The Hudson Review , picking poem out of the slush pile and mailing them to an outside panel of editorial adviser . I wa trying hard in my letter to impress one of them : Hayden Carruth , a gruff and irreverent 81-year-old poet who lived far upstate . I loved Carruth ’ s work but wa more enamored with his persona : his yeoman life in the wood , his intolerance for phoniness and , most of all , the precision with which he articulated common suffering , including one strain of his own suffering that I related to , particularly in those year , but wouldn ’ t have had the courage , or clarity , to examine .
 “ I had always been aware , ” Carruth once wrote of his youth , “ that the Universe is sad ; everything in it , animate or inanimate , the wild creature , the stone , the star , wa enveloped in the great sadness , pervaded by it . ... Never then or now have I been able to look at a cloudless sky at night and see beauty there . A kind of grandeur , yes — but not beauty . The profusion and variety of celestial light have always frightened me . Why are they there ? Why these instead of others ? Why these instead of nothing ? ”
 That wa how I felt , watching the whale from the beach : afraid that everything wa accident . Then again , maybe it ’ s just hard to picture the start of the trip in retrospect without amplifying some feeling of foreboding . Something else Carruth wrote that ha always stuck with me : “ The wilderness begin at the edge of my body , at the edge of my consciousness , and extends to the edge of the universe , and it is filled with menace . ”

 It wa mid-August 2002 , and we were 23 , 24 and 25 . We had graduated from college together two year earlier . Dave , whom I also grew up with , shot out of undergrad knowing he wanted to be a doctor and had just finished his first year of medical school . Any similar momentum I had after graduation wa instantly sapped . Three night after I returned to my parent ’ house from school , I found myself driving my father to the emergency room . Three week after that , he died . My grief wa disorienting and total ; at a moment in life when everything is supposed to feel possible , making any single decision became impossible . I gave into that sadness for the better part of a year , resettling at home in New Jersey with my widowed mother and sliding back to the summer job I worked during school , glumly breaking down beef at a butcher shop two town over .
 I coped with my fatherlessness and confusion in way I ’ m not proud of and still don ’ t understand . I read a lot of book about Ronald Reagan , for example , even the collection of his love letter to Nancy . I also lashed out at Dave , who wa living at home that summer , too , studying for the MCAT . He withdrew awkwardly after the funeral , and I suppose I wa happy to hold that against him . It triggered some longstanding jealousy . A part of me always resented how he seemed unfairly exempt from the self-doubt and heaviness that I wa prone to .
 Jon , meanwhile , wa teaching at a rustic little boarding school in Switzerland , where his mother wa from . The summer after graduation , before starting the job , he set out for Alaska with a friend , sleeping in the bed of their old pickup . In the minuscule town of Gustavus , the gateway to Glacier Bay , he picked up seasonal work in the warehouse of a kayak-tour company . Jon had little actual experience of sea kayaking but had always felt drawn to the ocean in the abstract . In college , he and another friend plotted out a paddling expedition near Glacier Bay , across the border in Canada and applied for a grant from our school to fund it . The grant wa set up in memory of an alumnus who died in an avalanche while mountaineering . It wa meant to encourage the “ responsible and conscientious pursuit of wilderness expeditions. ” Safety wa key . But the committee rejected Jon and his partner ’ s application . They seemed insufficiently prepared .
 That wasn ’ t surprising . Jon grew up doing a lot of backcountry camping and wa a competent outdoorsman , but putting together a grant application required a kind of administrative fastidiousness he didn ’ t always posse . He wa bright but scatterbrained , forever picking up thing and putting them down , both figuratively ( music project , conversation ) but also literally . I can still picture him hustling around the house we shared in college , hunting for his key or his soldering iron , having gotten in over his head rewiring some device . He wa an artist ; one piece I remember consisted of a half-peeled banana , implanted with circuitry and suspended in a jar of formaldehyde . Once , he grew grass in our upstairs bathroom — a living bathmat , he said — until the turf became muddy and flooded the downstairs .
 This wa Jon ’ s third summer in Alaska , and he ’ d worked his way up to leading expedition , taking out vacationer for day at a time . Our trip , however , would venture beyond the typical circuit , into a remote corner of the park that he ’ d never been to . Jon had no serious concern about our safety , but he felt he bore responsibility for our emotional well-being . To enjoy ourselves , we would need to feel comfortable , not just in the wilderness but also with him a a leader .
 He suspected we wouldn ’ t trust him entirely . We didn ’ t . We knew him before he became a professional guide , and our perception of his expertise lagged behind the reality . “ With Jon , ” Dave told me , “ it wa always unclear to what extent he ’ d thought everything through. ” Dave remembered landing in Gustavus the night before we got underway and casually asking Jon a lot of question : Where are we going , exactly ? Do we have everything we need ? Jon seemed to have solid answer for all of them . As we headed back to his place for a good night ’ s sleep , he told u to wait in the yard . He wa living alone for the summer in a house that an acquaintance wa building in the wood . The structure wa framed-up but largely wall-less , and Jon , to be safe , needed to check that no moose had wandered in .
 After a spectacular first day of paddling , we came ashore on a rocky tidal flat about two mile from where we were dropped . Jon gave u his detailed tutorial about bear safety while we set up our campsite . He taught u , for example , to holler “ Hey , bear ! ” if we heard any rustling but also preventively , ahead of u , when we walked through the wood . The last thing you wanted wa to come across a brown bear unannounced .
 “ Hey , bear ! ” Jon kept hollering , by way of demonstration . He said it goofily , like a child ’ s TV host greeting some down-on-his-luck ursine neighbor at the doorway to their clubhouse . This wa intentional . Jon had noticed that the people on his trip often resisted bellowing “ Hey , bear ! ” into the wilderness . It wa essential for their safety , but it felt silly or vulnerable somehow , like singing in public . So he learned to turn it into a shtick , spinning it into a stream-of-consciousness narration : Hey , bear , I ’ m coming into the tree now . Hope you ’ re having a fantastic evening , Mr. Bear ! It loosened everyone up . They were performing for their friend now ; the whole group wa in on the joke .
 I had never seen a wild bear , though I have backpacked in bear country a handful of time . I felt comfortable with the animal in the abstract . But here , the bear weren ’ t abstract ; they breached the material plane . There were bear trail everywhere , leading from the tree line to the water , and disquietingly close , I felt , to where we were pitching our tent . We found heap of their scat . We saw tree where the animal had slashed off the bark to eat the inner layer , tuft of fur from their paw still plastered in the sap .
 I pretended I wa having fun . But that evening I grew increasingly petrified , almost delirious . My eye tightened , scanning for bear . The sound of the wind became bear , and so did the mossy stick cracking under our foot . I gave myself a migraine , then phased in and out of sleep .
 At sunrise , I woke feeling foolish . While Jon cooked pancake , I reasoned with myself , privately , in a notebook I brought on the trip . I tried to conceive of the situation a a geometry problem . Yes , some number of bear roved this landscape , I wrote : relatively tiny , independent blip , going about their business randomly , just like u . In all that empty space and confusion , a lethal collision of their moving blip and our moving blip would be an improbable coincidence . I ’ d been distorting those odds , mistaking myself for “ the absolute focus of all bear ’ attention , ” I wrote . It wa embarrassing , really . “ To be afraid of bear , ” I concluded , “ is to be narcissistic . ”
 I wa reminding myself that freakishly horrible thing are , by definition , unlikely to happen . Even now , my reasoning feel sound .
 [ Read about the search for a missing hiker in Joshua Tree ’ s wild interior . ]
 Day 2 wa a slog . We paddled through a spitting drizzle in an endless straight line , along the high granite wall of the coast . We talked le and le , just pushed through the emerald chop . Then eventually we gave up , hauling in our boat and making camp in a wide , crescent-shaped cove , short of the site that Jon originally picked out on his map .
 We had entered Dundas Bay , a rarely visited pocket of the national park that , I ’ ve since learned , ha a storied history a a hide-out for solitary misanthrope . In the 1930s , one prospector built a cabin not far from our campsite and brandished a gun at the Alaska Natives who passed through .
 We intuited that the scenery wa beautiful , but we could see very little of it through the fog . Our guidebook explained that “ the east side of the bay ” — where we were — “ can get extremely rough during foul weather , since large wave roll in ... and batter this shoreline. ” That wa happening now : The weather that plinked at u all afternoon wa roiling into a storm . Soon , the big rain started . We rushed through dinner , then loafed in our tent until , eventually , the loafing turned to sleep .
 A local newspaper would later describe the storm a “ short but intense. ” In Gustavus , a creek swelled to about a foot higher than it previous record . Gale wind , with gust up to 59 mile per hour , turned back two cruise ship in Skagway , about 85 mile north . Around 2 a.m. , we woke to discover the wind had shorn the rain fly off our tent . Jon ’ s sleeping bag and mine were soaked , while Dave wa snug and dry between u . We heard torrent of water lashing down and the wave crashing in the cove .
 We got up three or four hour later . The rain and wind no longer felt ferocious but were still too gnarly to paddle through ; there wa no question , Jon said , that we were staying put . We cooked breakfast and took turn playing chess in the tent . By late morning , the storm seemed to have passed . We were antsy . We figured we would take a look around .
 The terrain wa crammed with thicket of alder and spruce , underlain by fern and a furor of prickly thing . Jon pointed out devil ’ s club : three or four foot tall and leafy , armored up and down with spine . The plant pierced fleece and hurt like fire .
 There were no trail . We ’ d been trudging for some time when we reached a fast-moving stream , maybe 10 foot wide . Jon wa surprised ; it wasn ’ t on his map , most likely just a drainage bloated by the storm . We followed it downstream , looking for a way across , and eventually found it bridged by a hefty tree trunk . It seemed like an easy crossing . Jon stepped up and led the way , and Dave and I waited in a single-file line on the stream bank behind him . The creek wa loud , like a factory with all it gear and roller churning . Looking down , Jon realized there wa more water than he ’ d thought .
 That ’ s when I heard the snap in the wood behind me . After all my paranoia , I instantly understood that the many bear I ’ d thought I heard before were absolutely not bear — were nothing — because this sound wa so unmistakable and crisp , so explicitly something . I turned and hollered , “ Hey , bear ! ” then waited a beat . Maybe I said “ Hey , bear ! ” again ; I ’ m not sure . But I must have scanned those tree long enough to feel satisfied and safe , because I know I wa turning my head , to go back to my friend , when I saw the dark shape rushing forward in my peripheral vision .
 What I heard must have been root popping . If a tree is large enough , you can apparently hear them cracking underground like gunfire .
 The thud wa seismic . The trunk crashed down right next to me . Mapping out bit of evidence later , we concluded that the tree must have been about 80 foot tall and perhaps two foot in diameter . It wa some kind of conifer — a spruce or cedar . I screamed , involuntarily , “ Look out ! ” then watched Dave , a few step directly in front of me , dive sideways and hit the ground . When I got to him , he wa crouching , stunned but O.K . He looked up and said , “ Go get Jon . ”
 It hadn ’ t clicked back in for me : There were three of u . The sight of Dave going down had canceled out everything else . I scrambled out over the creek , running across the tree that had just fallen , shouting Jon ’ s name , then spotted him in the water , tangled in a snarl of sheared-off branch near the bank behind me — a cage , which kept him from hurtling downstream .
 He did not know he ’ d been hit by a falling tree . It had narrowly missed his head , struck his left shoulder , shearing it from his collarbone and breaking many of his rib . Later , a doctor would explain that the downward force had been so powerful that it had probably squashed Jon ’ s entire upper body , and all the organ inside , down toward his waist , momentarily compressing him like a bellow ; for a split second , his shoulder headed in the direction of his bellybutton , before his torso sprang up again .
 Jon had heard nothing , seen nothing . He wa turning around to help Dave onto the log — again , feeling responsible for our safety — and the next thing he knew , he wa in the water . He tried to reach out his left arm but could not make it move . He could not move his leg . He felt a bolt of pain down his spine .
 Jon later described flashing through an idiosyncratic sequence of thought , all in a few millisecond , a if watching a deck of card fanning across a table . One wa an image of himself in a wheelchair , sitting behind a mixing console in a fancy recording studio . “ I guess I can become a recording engineer in a wheelchair , ” he remembered thinking . He had never worked in a recording studio and , though he played music , he had no particular plan to . Still , this vision apparently felt like an acceptable future and freed him to resurface in the present . That wa when he registered me , screaming his name .
 Jon told himself he shouldn ’ t move . He knew from his many wilderness first-responder training that moving a person with spinal injury risk paralysis . Then again , he also knew that most of his body wa submerged in cold water , and he recognized that he risked dying of hypothermia if he didn ’ t move . “ If I ’ m already paralyzed , ” he concluded , “ I may a well move . ”
 He somehow hoisted himself out of the stream before Dave or I got to him , using his right arm and his chin and biting into something loamy with his teeth , for additional leverage . He reassessed the situation : better . Also : worse . He now realized that we were at least a mile inland from our camp .
 Suddenly , his body wa walking ; his leg just started working . Dave and I put him between u , supporting his frame . He wa moving faster than we expected , but uncoordinatedly . Then he crumpled between u . We tried again ; Jon wa dead weight . Dave noticed that his breathing wa shallow and his voice wa low — sign , Dave knew from med school , of a collapsed lung . He began battering Jon with a pep talk , telling him , firmly , that he had to get up , that we had to get out of here . Jon didn ’ t need that explained to him ; he wa cogent and still trying to plot our next step in his mind . He looked down to see why this log he wa resting on wa so lumpy and realized that he wa , in fact , sitting on his left arm . The arm wa slack , obviously broken ; his sleeve , pierced up and down with devil ’ s club . Jon had zero feeling in it . He found it amusing , this sensation of complete estrangement from one of his limb .
 Jon had been stressing that it wa important to stay together . But this wa another theory of wilderness survival that appeared to be breaking down in practice . Someone would have to get on the radio back at our camp . By chance , while marooned in our tent during the rainstorm the night before , Jon showed u how to use the device , though he did it almost a a formality ; the hand-held VHF unit wa merely a line-of-sight radio , he told u , meaning it range wa small , it signal too weak to pas through most obstacle . You were unlikely to reach anyone you couldn ’ t see , and we hadn ’ t seen anyone since a faraway fishing boat , early on Day 1 .
 There wa a moment of discussion , or maybe just an exchange of look between me and Dave . I told Dave he should go . I didn ’ t trust myself to find my way back . I also knew that I lacked the courage to try ; whether I wa being sensible or cowardly , I still don ’ t know . Besides , I took for granted that Dave would make it . He wa more capable in my mind , le likely to cinch himself in indecisive knot .
 Recently , though , Dave told me : “ You probably had no idea how much in my own head I wa . I know that you , growing up , definitely felt insecure about thing , and I think you looked at me and thought , Dave ha everything figured out . But I had so much anxiety. ” He brought up the tremor he used to have in his hand . I knew about it ; in high school , we waited table together , and I occasionally had to carry out Dave ’ s soup order , so he wouldn ’ t spill . But I guess I thought of the tremor a strictly physiological . I couldn ’ t see the vulnerability causing it .
 Now , a Dave sprinted away from me and Jon , swatting devil ’ s club from his path with the rubberized sleeve of his rain jacket , his nerve rose up and rattled him . He worried he wouldn ’ t be able to find the radio once he got back or know how to turn it on . What if he broke the radio , foreclosing whatever marginal chance we had of getting help ? There were lot of way to screw this up , Dave realized . More occurred to him a he ran .
 He found the radio . He turned it on . Then , having solved these problem , he encountered another he hadn ’ t anticipated : “ What is the appropriate thing you ’ re supposed to say ? ” he remembered thinking . On TV , you see a lot of people saying “ Mayday. ” And so , Dave faced the open water and started broadcasting into the fog : “ Mayday , Mayday. ” Even in that moment , though , alone on a beach in the middle of nowhere , he felt slightly self-conscious about it . This is so goddamn cliché , he thought .
 Back in the wood , kneeling over Jon , I wa having the same problem : I didn ’ t know what to say . He wa lying near a log on his injured side , his beard and glass flecked with dirt and tendril of moss . He seemed to be on the brink of losing consciousness . At no time would the possibility of Jon ’ s dying surface concretely in any of our mind . Still , I knew I wa supposed to keep talking to him , to tether him to the world with my voice somehow .
 I started vamping platitude : We were going to get out of here soon , and so forth . But I could feel myself treading water , even blundering , at one point , into a long-winded apology , worried I overstayed my welcome that one Christmas with his family . I wa afraid that the helplessness in my voice might be counterproductive , unsettling Jon instead of steadying him . It wa a tremendous silence to fill .
 What can a person say ? I had two literature professor in college who made u memorize poem . You never knew when some line of verse would come in handy , they claimed . One liked to brag that , while traveling through Ireland , he found that if he spat out some Yeats at a pub , he could drink free . This is how I wound up reciting a love poem to Jon .
 It wa “ The Shampoo , ” by Elizabeth Bishop , a lyric poem about the enormity of time , which turn startlingly intimate at the end , when Bishop offer to shampoo her lover ’ s silvering hair : “ Come , let me wash it in this big tin basin , /battered and shiny like the moon . ”
 After that , I imagine I also did some W.H . Auden ; I knew a fair amount of Auden back then . The stuff in rhyme and meter wa always easiest to memorize — “ Looking up at the star , I know quite well/That , for all they care , I can go to hell ” — which is why I had a lot of Robert Frost at my disposal a well : “ Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening , ” “ The Road Not Taken. ” For the most part , I trafficked in hit .
 Jon and I would spend about an hour and a half together alone on the forest floor . I ran through everything in my quiver — Kay Ryan , A.R . Ammons , Michael Donaghy — padding each poem with little prefatory remark , while Jon said nothing , just signaled with his eye or produced a sound whenever I checked in . I felt like a radio D.J . playing record in the middle of the night , unsure if anyone wa listening . And here ’ s one about owl by Richard Wilbur , I would tell Jon , and off we would go .
 I must have also done at least one by Hayden Carruth , my curmudgeonly pen pal at the literary magazine . Carruth ’ s poem didn ’ t lend themselves to memorization , but I ’ d worked hard to nail one of my favorite , in which he describes stopping to notice a deer standing in an apple thicket , then realizing the northern light are flaring overhead . Hayden and the animal pas a moment in stillness together . “ We are proud to be afraid , ” he writes , “ proud to share/the silent magnetic storm that destroys the stars. ” Relative to that boundless violence above them , he and the deer are momentarily allied , though still not entirely connected : “ a glimpse , an acknowledgment/it is enough and never enough . ”
 That ’ s what I said to my friend , powerlessly , tenting my jacket over his face when it started to rain . The title of the poem is : “ I Know , I Remember , But How Can I Help You . ”
 The Coast Guard cutter Mustang wasn ’ t where it wa supposed to be . The 110-foot patrol boat normally spent it time coursing through the Gulf of Alaska , inspecting halibut-fishing vessel , or circulating , a a terrorist deterrent , near the oil terminal at Valdez . It wa home-ported in Seward , hundred of mile from Glacier Bay . But the crew wa transiting to Juneau for a training when , a few day earlier , they were smacked by the same storm that later poured inland , over u . “ We had gotten absolutely pummeled , ” John Roberts , a petty officer on the Mustang , told me recently . For two day , the boat swished around in 15-foot-plus sea . Many on the crew had been hunkered in the mess deck , vomiting , while Roberts and a couple of his shipmate did their best to cover everyone ’ s watch . Finally , the Mustang slipped into Glacier Bay to find some protection . The weather started to ease . That afternoon , a Roberts piloted the Mustang east , toward Dundas Bay , his pallid crewmates were finally staggering back up to the bridge , asking where the hell they were .
 That wa when Dave ’ s Mayday call came through . The signal on the Mustang ’ s radio wa thin and faint , barely edging into range . Another of the ship ’ s petty officer , Eamon McCormack , explained to me that in retrospect the connection feel “ mind-boggling. ” Glacier Bay National Park extends over more than 5,000 square mile . Our signal would have covered two or three mile at most . And yet , a boat — a Coast Guard boat , no le — happened to be passing through that exceedingly small window at precisely the right time . “ I don ’ t know if , nine time out of 10 , you play that over again and the outcome would be the same , ” McCormack said . A moment earlier or later — second , potentially — and we might have slipped out of alignment . The moving boat would have cruised out of range , uncoupling from u forever .


 It wa 1:25 p.m. when the Mustang received Dave ’ s call , according to one of the subsequent Coast Guard report . Roberts couldn ’ t believe it . “ Come on , man , I ’ m tired , ” he said aloud , wearily , to the receiver in front of him . Roberts waited for a moment , per protocol , on the off chance that the Coast Guard ’ s central communication center in Juneau would pick up the call instead . Then he turned and asked his watch commander to pull out all the standardized search-and-rescue paperwork . He wa steeling himself , resummoning his professionalism . “ I guess we ’ re doing this , ” he said .
 Roberts wa the crew member on the Mustang with the most current medical training ; he would complete his E.M.T . certification the following month . As he started firing question at Dave on the radio , he didn ’ t like the answer that he heard coming back : the shallowness of Jon ’ s breathing , the likelihood of a punctured lung . More fundamental , Roberts remembered : “ Any time a tree fall on somebody , it ’ s not good. ” He wa also unsettled to learn that Dave and I both lived in New York City — a red flag , he had found , when someone wind up in trouble in the wilderness .
 We were 100 nautical mile from the nearest hospital ; a half-day trip , even in ideal condition . The Mustang requested that the Coast Guard Air Station in Sitka send a helicopter , but the immediate plan wa for Roberts and three crewmates to peel toward shore in the ship ’ s Zodiac and track u down . Dave had found the flare in Jon ’ s emergency kit and now , at 2:20 , with the Zodiac underway , the Coast Guard asked him to fire it . He wa still in front of our campsite , facing the water . He ’ d never shot off a flare before . He aimed straight up , then watched a the bright tracer rose and arced somewhere far behind him , deep in the wood . He wa uncertain whether this counted a a success . He started scanning the fog in front of him , but the Zodiac never appeared .
 Someone on the Mustang caught sight of the flare near the end of it arc and immediately directed the crew on the Zodiac toward it , steering them far away from Dave to the opposite side of the little peninsula we ’ d camped on . And yet , this wa lucky : they wound up coming ashore much closer to where I wa waiting in the wood with Jon . Soon , whatever poem I wa reciting wa interrupted by whistle blowing and voice calling , and eventually three shape , wearing hard hat and heavy orange rain gear , rushed toward u out of the tree .
 Roberts wa especially impressive , a reassuringly large Boston-area native with a booming voice . He knelt and took Jon ’ s vitals . The information wa troubling : his pulse wa 60 beat per minute ; his breathing , fast and shallow . They put his neck in a brace and eased him onto a kind of truncated backboard , called a Miller board , to move him out to the beach . Dave had returned by then . He and I crouched at one end of the board , near Jon ’ s foot , a someone — presumably Roberts — bellowed a count of three to lift .
 Later that night , lying down to sleep in a bed-and-breakfast in Gustavus — stunned and depleted , but dry and warm — Dave and I would talk and talk , reviewing the entire ordeal . We had drooped into a long silence , coasting toward sleep , when Dave spoke up with one last observation . When we were getting ready to lift Jon on the backboard , he said , it occurred to him that this wa one of those crisis moment you hear about , like when mother are suddenly able to lift a car off their baby . Dave expected we were going to have superhuman strength .
 We did not have superhuman strength . On Roberts ’ s command , the men raised Jon to waist height , swiftly and seemingly perfectly level , a though their arm and deltoid were hydraulic . Then , in one motion , they took off downhill , with negligible help from u . This can ’ t be accurate , but I remember the sensation of being almost dragged , like child in a sled .
 A National Geographic television crew wa embedded at the Coast Guard ’ s air station in Sitka , filming an installment of a thrill-ride reality series . The network had sent crew to other Coast Guard station around the country too , though this assignment appeared to hold the most dramatic potential . Air Station Sitka wa unique : Its pilot were responsible for 12,000 mile of coastline , a sprawling , treacherous wilderness riven with fjord , inlet and glacier , often buffeted by implacably horrible weather . People who went into the backcountry in Alaska had a way of getting themselves into a different magnitude of trouble , too ; a Roberts put it , “ When stuff happens in Alaska , it ’ s big. ” Still , this wa the television crew ’ s eighth day in Sitka , and a the show ’ s producer , Annabelle Hester , explained : “ I wa having call with my boss at headquarters saying , ‘ Nothing is happening ! ’ We were scrambling to come up with Plan B. ” Then , the Mustang ’ s call came in at 1:42 .
 “ What type of injury are we looking at ? ” asked the dispatcher . She wa taking the call from behind a semicircular counter , like the reception desk at a midlevel corporate branch office . She had a framed snapshot of a parakeet to brighten her work space , and a photograph of a dog with a heart that said , “ I Woof You. ” A cameraman stood conspicuously beside her , holding a tense , tight shot .
 “ Probable broken rib , a definite broken arm , ” said the man on the other end . Then his voice faltered , seemed to give up : “ And whatever else would happen to you if a tree fell on you , ” he added .
 The dispatcher retrieved the appropriate paperwork and scribbled “ Tree fell on person ” on one line . She read the current weather aloud : “ 30 knot wind , 300 ceiling , heavy rain and one-mile vis. ” That would soon be revised : the ceiling had dropped to 100 foot . Entering the weather condition on one of the Coast Guard incident report , someone would write , in a kind of nihilistic catchall : “ Extremely terrible . ”
 The Coast Guard ’ s policy wa to deploy a helicopter within 30 minute of the initial request , but the Air Station ’ s operation officer , Cmdr . Karl Baldessari , informed everyone that this mission would take longer to plan . Baldessari wa a 25-year veteran of the Coast Guard , a fast-moving , sinewy man in a blousy flight suit , with a tidy mustache and spiky hair . His role at the air station wa that of a firehouse chief . He wa responsible for the safety of everyone working there , which meant making judicious decision about what warranted sending them hurtling through the sky .
 That calculus got knotty in condition like these , though there wa a baseline volatility to flying in Alaska at all . The Coast Guard didn ’ t let it helicopter pilot fly lead out of Sitka , no matter how much experience they had at other air station , until they practiced difficult landing at specific location in the region and got their ego battered a little by logging a full winter in the state . Visibility in Alaska wa frequently poor ; condition changed quickly . One pilot told me about blindly tunneling through fog in the dark when his co-pilot got “ caged ” : The man lifted his eye momentarily from his instrument and , without any visual reference or a horizon to latch onto , found it impossible to reorient himself , lost all sense of direction and wa felled by vertigo .
 During much of the year it wa also cold enough , with sufficient moisture in the air , that ascending to clear the region ’ s many minor mountain or even just flying through a cloud risked the aircraft ’ s icing up . To mitigate this , the Coast Guard had laid out virtual “ track line ” across the entirety of their range : a grid of GPS point and a network of path connecting them , along which pilot could chart a course and fly at a relatively low altitude , confident they weren ’ t going to smash into a mountain . The system wasn ’ t comprehensive ; the track line got the pilot close to their destination , but ultimately they had to diverge from this GPS superhighway and fly the remaining distance the old-fashioned way , with their radar and eye . It wa like taking an exit off the interstate , except there might be a granite wall in front of you wherever you chose to get off . It wa possible the pilot would travel very far — a half-mile away from whoever needed their help — only to discover that the last leg wa too risky and be forced to turn back .
 Baldessari gathered the two pilot on duty that afternoon and the Air Station ’ s flight surgeon , then unrolled a large paper map . He pointed to our location , explaining : “ That ’ s probably one of the lousiest place we fly in and out of . This Inian Pass , right here , is the worst place we could possibly go . ”
 Inian Pass is a slim channel near the center of the Icy Strait , the long , interconnected system of waterway stretching through Glacier Bay . Conditions in the Icy Strait can be bad 300 day of the year , Baldessari recently told me ; wind , rain and storm surge all push through it fast from the open ocean . But Inian Pass is a narrow keyhole at the center of the strait — a mile-wide opening between a few uninhabited island and a rocky point — where all that weather speed up . The only way for the pilot to reach u would be to fly straight through it .
 Nothing in the National Geographic footage , at this point , feel reassuring . The flight surgeon hold his hand over his mouth and bite his lip . The co-pilot , Chris Ferguson , only a few month into his posting in Alaska , mill around and fidget with his ear . It ’ s obvious Baldessari need convincing . He wasn ’ t eager to send his men up if he didn ’ t have to and wasn ’ t certain they would make it all the way there if he did .
 “ It ’ s kind of funny , ” he told the pilot , pointing at the map . “ You ’ ve got a boat right here . ”
 Lying on his backboard like a burl of driftwood , Jon wa conscious and cognizant of his pain , but he had started to feel somehow buffered from his body , uninterested in connecting with the world beyond it . He would later describe himself a a “ thinking blob . It wa a very passive experience. ” He didn ’ t know what wa happening but could tell our momentum had stalled . He wa confused and felt impatient . In his mind , the three of u had solved the impossible problem : We ’ d managed to get help . This wa supposed to be the simple part , when everyone rushed him to the hospital . Instead , his condition deteriorated . Within 10 minute of reaching the beach , Jon threw up . I ’ d never seen anything like it , a kind of dark purple gristle . I took out my wool cap to wipe his face , and he retched a second time , straight into my hat .
 “ I got that all over me , ” John Roberts told me recently . He ’ d seen vomit like that before ; it meant Jon had ingested a fair amount of blood and signaled internal injury . It made Roberts anxious . He had been on the Mustang for two and a half year at that point but had spent the previous four year in Palm Beach , a busy but le extreme posting that often involved rescuing weekend boater from relatively close to shore — and where , Roberts pointed out , the water is warm and won ’ t necessarily kill you if you go in . Moreover , the bulk of the Coast Guard ’ s training is for maritime rescue , not rescue on land . Counterintuitive a it sound , Roberts ’ s comfort level and confidence had dropped significantly once he hopped off the Zodiac and set foot on the beach .
 He reported back to the Mustang that Jon had thrown up , then soon radioed again , explaining that Jon wa going into shock . He kept giving and requesting update , trying to gauge how long this might take , and eventually started erecting a makeshift shelter out of plastic sheeting and medical tape , hoping to keep Jon out of the rain . Out of earshot of u , Roberts explained to his crew mate Eamon McCormack what the vomit meant : The possibility of Jon dying , here under their care , wa real . At one point in the National Geographic footage , a Roberts ’ s call are relayed to the air station in Sitka , you can see where the dispatcher clearly writes on her form : “ E.M.T . doe not feel comfortable . ”
 By this time , the air station ’ s flight surgeon had received enough information to be alarmed . “ It sound like he ’ s got a pretty significant chest injury , ” he told Baldessari . Baldessari understood they would need to launch a helicopter but warned the Mustang that the aircraft might not make it through the weather ; ultimately it would be the pilot ’ call , once they veered off their last track line and tried to shoot through Inian Pass .
 They would go and give it a look , Baldessari explained over the radio , but the outlook wa iffy . The guy on the beach , he said , must be prepared to get Jon back on their cutter and haul him to a hospital themselves , a fast a they could .
 One evening this winter , my phone rang , and it wa Karl Baldessari . Long retired from the Coast Guard , he wa teaching aviation at a community college in Oregon , where I left a voice mail message earlier that day . I meanwhile had metamorphosed into a 40-year-old father of two and fumbled to explain to Baldessari that , a thrilled a I wa to have tracked him down , I wa , at the moment , racing to finish a risotto for my daughter before gymnastics practice and would have to call him back . Without missing a beat , Baldessari blared order at me , joking , but still sounding a instinctually in charge a he did in the National Geographic footage : “ O.K. , ” he said , “ you want to stir it constantly , but slowly ! ”
 I didn ’ t expect any of the Coast Guardsmen I wa cold-calling to remember that day . However dramatic it remained for me , I assumed it would have been obscured in a yearslong wash of more sensational incident . But everyone I spoke to did remember it , immediately and in detail . Baldessari had been involved in hundred of rescue operation during his 30-year career , and yet , a I stood at the stove on the phone that evening , he told me : “ The moment I listened to your voice mail , I knew exactly the case ! It wa almost like it wa yesterday . ”
 There wa something about the supreme freakishness of the accident that left a lasting impression . For those who came ashore , the experience wa also marked by a feeling of subtly escalating chaos and the pressure to surmount it . McCormack told me that ours wa a story he retold endlessly , often to the younger Coast Guardsmen he wa eventually tasked with training . In it wa a lesson about “ not taking situation that look impossible at face value , ” he said . “ When thing start to go wrong , don ’ t panic or lose sight of what resource you ’ ve got. ” Keep working the problem until it absolute end — even , McCormack added , if it mean deviating from official policy .


 McCormack wa not supposed to be landing an inflatable boat on an unforgivably rocky Alaskan shoreline , for example . But there he wa , anyway , beaching the Zodiac a gingerly a he could , so that Roberts and the other men could load Jon aboard . They slid him in on his side “ like a folder into a filing cabinet , ” a Jon put it , and started motoring through the chop , very cautiously , back to the Mustang , about a mile away .
 As relieved a Jon had been when the Coast Guard first arrived , he also felt instantaneously more vulnerable . Strapped to the back board , his neck in the collar , he surrendered control of his body , however imperfect that control had been . He wa being hauled around a an object now , with no ability to wriggle or shift position , to manage his pain or even to turn his head and see what wa happening . He wa helpless , entirely dependent on the upright people operating around him , those voice he could hear discussing him on the far side of some gauzy divide . About 10 minute into the trip on the Zodiac , Jon heard one of those voice say , “ Oh , shit , we ’ re losing air . ”
 A section of the Zodiac ’ s sponson — the inflatable fender that wrap around the boat — had punctured . One side wa completely deflated . “ It ’ s a big deal , ” McCormack recently explained to me , sounding surprised that I had to ask . The sponson increase the boat ’ s buoyancy and stability , a well a keeping water from cresting over the side ; under normal condition , a Zodiac with a broken sponson would have been taken out of service automatically . Instead , McCormack found the puncture and wedged the nozzle of a small pump inside . Then — steering the boat with one hand , operating the throttle with the other — he started working the pump with his foot , essentially doing leg press , to keep the fender partly inflated . The ride wa already bumpy in four-foot sea . Now McCormack began tracing a slow , zigzagging course , doing what he could to tamp down the turbulence and the violence to Jon ’ s spine , a well a to guard against the possibility of the injured man ’ s suddenly bounding over the side on his backboard .
 Roberts and the other Coast Guardsmen on the Zodiac leaned over Jon to shield him from the splash . The pain wa heinous ; Jon seemed to be passing out . Roberts talked to him , held his hand . Roberts felt crushed , he told me ; he wa torturing this guy in order to save him . When they finally reached the Mustang , rather than hoist Jon off the Zodiac , they swung the ship ’ s crane around and simply lifted the entire boat out of the water , level with the deck , and then carried him aboard , to keep from joggling him any more .
 McCormack eventually returned for me and Dave , and a half-hour later we were reunited with Jon in the Mustang ’ s athwartship passageway , a cramped , steel hallway , like the space between two car of a train . Jon wa still battened to the backboard , wedged up to keep the weight of his body on his less-painful side . They had cut off his clothes , though he ’ d murmured a plea not to — he wa wearing a brand-new Patagonia jacket that he had borrowed from a friend — then swaddled him in a hypothermia blanket . Dave and I knelt and rubbed his foot .
 The helicopter wa going to make it . I don ’ t remember there being a grand announcement . I ’ m not sure we were ever made aware of the possibility that it wouldn ’ t . Now the crew got busy below : tying down anything that could be blown off by the rotor wash or stashing it in the mess . I also don ’ t remember hearing the helicopter when it finally arrived . Instead , I remember only a heavy door to our left swinging open to reveal , like a scene from an action movie , the silhouette of a man in a blue flight suit , foot planted shoulder-width apart to steady himself a the ship rocked sideways . The cable he ’ d been lowered on drew back into the ocean spray and fog behind him . “ I ’ m flight surgeon Russ Bowman , ” he said and stepped inside .
 Bowman took Jon ’ s vitals and gave him several , successive shot of morphine . Soon , everyone wa working to squeeze him back through the narrow doorway and onto the deck where the helicopter , an MH-60 Jayhawk , wa idling overhead .
 Until recently , the story I told about the accident unfolded in two basic act : the tree fell , instantaneously unleashing a kind of unfathomable chaos ; then the Coast Guard appeared and , just a swiftly , regathered that chaos into order . It wa like watching footage of an exploding object , then watching it run in reverse . The maneuver the Coast Guard wa readying to execute now , on the deck of the Mustang , would be the climax of that progression .
 The helicopter hovered 30 or 40 foot over the boat , mirroring it speed and trajectory , while both vehicle moved slowly forward . “ Looks like you ’ re heading for a rain squall , ” the co-pilot , Chris Ferguson , radioed the Mustang at one point , and asked the ship to adjust it course , to keep them in a forgiving weather a possible . Soon the flight mechanic wa calling out instruction to tuck the aircraft into alignment : “ Forward and right 30 . Forward and right 20 . Forward and right 10. ” Then , finally — speaking , in the flight recording , with an almost galling air of imperturbability — the lead helicopter pilot , Rich McIntyre , radioed the flight mechanic to begin the hoist .
 The whole procedure , from our vantage point , seemed seamless and routine . In a way , it wa : After the agonized deliberation at the air station , the pilot exited off their GPS route into fairly manageable condition around Inian Pass . The wind were workable ; the water wasn ’ t excessively choppy . Ultimately , scooping Jon off the deck of the Mustang would resemble a standard exercise that the pilot drilled in their training . “ Not to dumb it down , ” the co-pilot , Chris Ferguson , told me — plucking someone with a spinal injury off a moving boat and hoisting them into a moving helicopter is a pretty insane thing to do . “ But we normalize what isn ’ t normal . ”
 A few moment earlier , a the men scurried around Jon on his backboard , packaging and fastening him for the hoist , Jon worried that the second he got airborne he would start twirling uncontrollably , like the feathery end of a cat toy , and potentially thwack his head on the equipment on deck . But now , he wa levitating smoothly — a solitary , swaddled bale of a man , perfectly perpendicular to the ground . Dave and I watched it happen : our friend rising steadily away from u , improbably , to safety . As Jon floated higher , he could hear the Coast Guardsmen on the Mustang beneath him begin to cheer . He felt it wa safe to open his eye . When he did , he saw someone , hunched in the open cargo door of the helicopter , pointing a television camera at him .
 Jon wa rushed into surgery at the hospital in Sitka that evening . He ’ d punctured both lung , one to the point of collapse , sustained multiple fracture on eight of his rib , broken several vertebra , shattered his left shoulder blade and snapped his brachial plexus nerve . His spleen had been macerated into countless fleck . After awakening from surgery , Jon wa disappointed that the doctor had swept those shard into a bag and thrown his spleen in the trash ; he wanted to get a look at it , maybe even keep it preserved in a jar , alongside his cyborg-banana .
 Once back in Gustavus , Dave and I realized that we would need to call Jon ’ s parent in Switzerland . I didn ’ t have to push the job on Dave this time ; he wa adamant . He felt he would need to face conversation like these if he wa going to be a doctor . It wa Jon ’ s father who picked up , and after absorbing the news , he paused and caught Dave off guard . “ Thank you , ” he said solemnly . “ You guy saved my son ’ s life . ”
 Dave ’ s stomach dropped . “ I remember thinking about it , ” he told me recently , “ and realizing , Yeah . I guess , logistically , we did. ” I had the same reaction when Dave hung up the phone and , clearly shaken , relayed his conversation to me . Until that moment , the idea that we saved Jon ’ s life had never occurred to u , possibly because the idea that Jon might have died still hadn ’ t occurred to u . We had zero sense of accomplishment , or even agency . In our mind , all we did wa avoid screwing up until the real help could arrive and save him .
 But Jon hadn ’ t absorbed the story that way . From the instant he willed himself out of the water , he felt all of u locking into that same seamless flow of order steadily displacing chaos that Dave and I only experienced once the Coast Guard arrived . It wa amazing to him how the three of u managed to generate solution for each successive problem . Even my reciting those poem , which to me had always felt like a moment of utter helplessness , became , in Jon ’ s telling , a perfect emblem of that streak of serendipitous problem-solving . “ You conveyed a calmness , ” he told me recently . “ I remember it being this nice moment. ” He added that if he ever ha to spend two hour dying on a remote forest floor again , having me there to recite poetry would be one of his top way to do it .
 The feeling of inevitability that day became only more pronounced for Jon a time passed and the entire story of our rescue receded into a prologue to the rest of his life . The surgery in Sitka wa only the first of half a dozen , and it would take several year for him to regain 60 percent of the use of his arm , wrist and hand , a the nerve gradually regrew along his injured side . He wa in good enough shape to go back to Alaska the summer after the accident — repairing boat in the company ’ s warehouse and occasionally helping out at the bed-and-breakfast — but he struggled . He could repair kayak but needed help lifting them . He wa unable to wrestle the mattress corner into the fitted sheet when he made the bed . After that , he started working at a recording studio in Portland , just a he envisioned while stuck in the water , and he now run his own audio-mastering company : Spleenless Mastering .
 Eventually Jon seemed to have recovered from the accident without any conspicuous disability . But his life ha been quietly corroded by chronic pain and , almost equally , by the stress of navigating the doctor , medication ( and their side effect ) to manage it . About two year after the accident , he learned he had PTSD . The trauma wasn ’ t the falling tree , but his experience of powerlessness a a perpetual patient in the American medical system . It manifested a a kind of unbearable empathy for anyone who wa suffering . Jon found himself shouting at doctor , on his own behalf but also on behalf of stranger in waiting room who weren ’ t being seen . He would hear interview with natural-disaster victim or the homeless on NPR and have to pull his car over . There continued to be other tribulation , too — more mundane one . A few time a year , he still rebreaks a rib out of nowhere ; once or twice , Jon told me , all it ha taken is an especially affectionate hug from his wife .
 Jon found early on that he could cordon off this suffering , both in his own mind and in conversation , by making joke about the accident itself and sticking to the happy ending of our rescue , a trick that got much easier after the National Geographic show aired later that year . “ Mission Rescue : Final Frontier , ” the program wa called . The soundtrack wa all heart-thwacking synth drum and shredding guitar . A foreboding , Ken Burns-effected snapshot of Dave and Jon looking joyful before the trip gave way to a whirring re-enactment of someone else ’ s leg — cast in the role of Dave ’ s leg — sprinting through the blurry wood for our radio . A melodramatic narrator pondered the fate of “ Kayaker Jon Cohrs . ”
 Initially , the schlockiness of the production felt like a blessing . The show depersonalized the accident , giving u all a shorthand to convey how dramatic that day had been , without confronting how destabilizing and senseless it might have felt . At a party , you could lay out the basic — a tree fell on Jon — then say , “ National Geographic even made a TV special about it , ” and everyone would go wide-eyed but then move on , figuring you would unspool the real story some other time .
 But we never realized the degree to which that kitschy shorthand started to obscure the real story — then , gradually , to replace it . I ’ m embarrassed to admit that , though Jon and I have remained close , I did not know the extent to which he ha continued to suffer for the last 17 year until talking to him for several hour in order to write this account .
 The morning after the accident , Dave and I traveled back to Dundas Bay to pack up our campsite and collect the kayak we abandoned the previous evening . We were shuttled there from Gustavus by the same boat captain who dropped u off three day earlier , a forbiddingly taciturn commercial fisherman named Doug Ogilvy .
 The tide in the cove wa way out when we arrived ; it wa , a Ogilvy put it , “ a suck-ass beach. ” The approach wa so shallow that he had to drop anchor a hundred yard or more from shore . He asked if we had wader . We did not . So Ogilvy put on his , climbed down the ladder and told Dave to get on his back . Then stoically , like an ox or an old-timey strongman hauling a safe , he trudged through the thigh-high water , dropped Dave on the gravel beach , then lurched back and hauled me the same way , a if I were a man-size infant in a papoose .
 Dave told me he ’ d had a strange feeling on the ride out , a if we would discover that an even more massive tree had fallen on our tent since we last slept there and that all three of u would have been crushed and killed if we ’ d spent another night in Dundas Bay , a planned . That is , he half-expected to find evidence that the accident had been fortuitous somehow , that there wa a reason , or redemptive value , behind it . My mother had the same instinct when I called her the night before . On the phone I strained to emphasize for her — she wa only two year into her cruelly premature widowhood , and I wa new at being the overprotective son of a widow — that Jon wa going to be all right , and that Dave and I were safe . She told me that my dad must have been up there looking out for u somehow .
 I resented all the supernatural thinking . If it comforted other people , fine , but I ’ d somehow known right away that I didn ’ t need a reason for the accident . It wa senseless , but straightforward , a unequivocal a fact a my father ’ s death had been . A tree fell in the wood . It might not have , but it did . Jon could have died , but he didn ’ t . Other possibility spiraled infinitely outward from there , though apparently I wasn ’ t too interested in contemplating them . As strange a it sound , it wa year before I realized that the tree could have hit me — and only after a friend pointed this out , a I told the story around a fire one night . And it wa only a few week ago , while on the phone with Jon , that it occurred to me that the tree could have hit all three of u — we were standing in a single-file line , after all , waiting to cross the creek — and that we all might have wound up clobbered and scattered in that river , dying slowly and watching each other die .
 It ’ s also probably true that I helped preclude these possibility by being so feverishly paranoid about bear , wheeling around at the sound of the snapping root . That ’ s what allowed me to see the tree coming , just barely , and scream that infinitesimal heads-up for Dave . And so , the real meaning of the accident , if I felt compelled to find one , might be that it validated my most exaggerated fear . But instead , it somehow helped cleanse me of them . There wa comfort for me in accepting the arbitrariness of what happened , in regarding it a a spasm of random damage in time and space that , just a randomly , a small number of human being got the opportunity to repair . We were more capable than I had understood . We were also far more helpless .
 On the ride back to Gustavus with our gear , I pictured myself , again , a a small blip in empty space . The ride wa rough and jumpy a Ogilvy impatiently pounded his boat through the last vestigial wave energy of the storm ; Dave and I had to hold on , to plant ourselves on the bench behind him . But there wa a moment when I felt so safe that I loosened my grip , leaned slightly into the motion of the boat , and , closing my eye , felt myself lift off the seat .

 The particular sheen of America by Amtrak .
 By CAITY WEAVER
 Holly Andres
 Tell your fellow american that you plan to cross the United States by train , and their reaction will range from amusement at your spellbinding eccentricity to naked horror that they , through some fatal social miscalculation , have become acquainted with a person who would plan to cross the United States by train . Depending how you slice it — time or money — there are either 61 or 960 immediate reason not to travel by Amtrak train from New York City to Los Angeles . Those are the extra hour and dollar , respectively , that you might reasonably expect to forfeit if you forgo a six-hour $ 129 nonstop flight and opt instead for an Amtrak sleeper car . Covering the interjacent 2,448.8 mile can easily consume some 67 hour for a mind-boggling $ 1,089 .
 Of course , you might remind your quote-unquote fellow , any form of modern engine-based transport , even Amtrak , is preposterously fast compared with the method that Homo sapiens employed to move ourselves and , more important , our tchotchke for most of our specie ’ 300,000-year history , which is walking . Crossing the stretch of land where roughly half the Donner party starved , froze or , in the case of the group ’ s two Miwok guide , were shot to death for food — an overland journey that took the party about five month to complete in 1847 — could be done in under two hour by a Honda Accord today , assuming normal traffic , while a plane from Springfield , Ill. , their starting point , to Sacramento would zoom over their whole route in half a day , including layover . Because of this ability to effectively teleport between location , 21st-century Americans have become flippant about transcontinental voyaging . To truly appreciate the size of the landmass ( the third-largest country in the world by land area ) and the variety of it terrain ( rain forest , desert , prairie , Margaritaville , etc . ) , you have to see it from the ground .
 Amtrak cling to the hope that someday people will view it service not a something that suck and that they hate , but a something that is actually nice and that they don ’ t hate . There ’ s a whole separate Amtrak website dedicated to this dream ( AmtrakVacations.com ) , where Amtrak doe thing like describe Los Angeles to people who have never heard of it . “ The ‘ City of Angels ’ is one of the premier attraction in sunny Southern California. ” But the other selling point of a cross-country train trip is a chance to look behind the American scrim : to learn where the nation make and store the hidden part that run it , to find new place you wish you had been born , to spy on backyard and high school football field whose possible existence had never occurred to you . Or me . Why not me ? My boyfriend and I were planning a short vacation out West anyway . I could just leave a few day before him and get there after he arrived .
 As I quickly learned , there are no passenger rail route that cross the entire United States in a single trip , nor are there likely to be any soon . Even proponent of the high-speed railway system much lauded in Asia and Europe ( and tentatively proposed in Congress ’ s Green New Deal resolution ) generally give the competitive edge to plane for travel across distance greater than 600 mile . At present , reaching California by rail from New York requires at least two train , one of which will depart from New Orleans or Chicago , all of which , like most line operated by Amtrak , have name so sumptuously picturesque ( Maple Leaf , Coast Starlight , Sunset Limited ) they make the storybook “ Polar Express ” sound a sterile a “ Amtrak ” by comparison . To book ticket , a person must first complete a battery of test measuring her patience , hand-eye coordination and aptitude for deductive mathematical reasoning , in the guise of Amtrak ’ s impossible-to-use online trip planner . ( While the trip planner can not identify the train station nearest to an address , or even a city , it can tell you the name of the city you have already typed into it search bar , provided there is an Amtrak train station there . ) The fastest way to complete this slow journey is to take the Lake Shore Limited to Chicago ’ s Union Station , then board the Southwest Chief to Los Angeles , one of sunny Southern California ’ s much-hyped premier attraction .
 Contrary to multiple acquaintance ’ declaration that I would encounter “ some real weirdo ” on the train , the first person I met on board my first sleeper car after boarding the train in Penn Station wa a man in a sparkly cardigan and leather pant who breezily identified himself a “ a prophet , ” which is perhaps the world ’ s second-oldest profession . And forgive me if I find nothing “ weird ” about being gainfully employed under a supervisor with the kind of multinational name recognition God ha .
 As he doubtless expected , the prophet and I were in opposite Viewliner roomette — private compartment Amtrak describes a “ designed for one or two passenger , ” although a roomette is both narrower and shorter than a standard porta potty . What Amtrak ha managed to cram into this minuscule space is impressive : a fold-down sink , two cushioned bench that convert to a bed , a second premade bed that lower from the ceiling , a tiny foldout table with an inset of alternating colored square for checker or chess , a coat hook , a luggage cubby , a large picture window and the largest variety of not-quite-matching shade of dark blue upholstery fabric ever assembled . There is even a small metal toilet covered with a puce-colored lid , which invite the brainteaser : Is it more luxurious to have a private toilet inch away from your sleeping area , or a shared toilet elsewhere ?
 The prophet sat silently in his compartment with the curtain open .
 [ See a voyage by train through Nigeria . ]
 The car ’ s friendly attendant advised me that the recommended way to enter the upper berth wa to step first atop the toilet seat ( a little over a foot off the ground ) , then , using a wall-mounted handle for balance , climb onto the narrow built-in ledge above the toilet , rotate my body 90 degree and , fueled by a cocktail of optimism and derring-do , launch myself into the bed suspended in midair . To prevent occupant from rolling off their 28-inch-wide mattress ( the same width a a standard casket ) and falling several foot to the floor , stowed beneath the mattress of every upper bunk is a kind of net of seatbelt that hook with grim determination into the ceiling . Once on the bed , I subjected my body to a series of Cirque du Soleil-inspired experiment to confirm that this safety web would indeed hold my weight , were I to roll unconsciously into it at 2 a.m . I tested the strength of the strap with one leg . I rolled from the wall into the net , flopping my limb . I placed each hand on a segment of net and pushed against it with the full force of my upper body , something that I had never done in my sleep but that now seemed possible or even probable . It seemed secure .
 It also seemed representative of Amtrak ’ s casual , makeshift approach to passenger — a slightly refreshing , slightly unnerving attitude to encounter after a lifetime of air travel . The freedom to move about in a train evokes an illicit , almost danger-courting autonomy . ( The nonprofit National Safety Council report that a person in the United States is several time more likely to die of “ sharp object ” than a plane or train crash , though the event that preceded the recent emergency Boeing grounding make such statistic cold comfort . )
 The instruction given by conductor and attendant were not so much formulaic a they were desperately obvious — a black comic litany of bare-minimum survival tip . “ Just for your safety please do not walk or play on these track , ” went one announcement . Another asked parent to ensure young child did not “ wander around the train alone. ” Although there wa no whiff of a T.S.A . screening in place ( it would presumably be possible for someone to arrive one minute before departure carrying a duffel bag of uranium and sword and hop right on , although hopefully no one will ) , pantomime of security distributed responsibility among everyone aboard . “ WE ’ RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER ... LITERALLY ” read the text on a safety brochure promoting Amtrak ’ s “ If You See Something , Say Something ” campaign .
 Even on short plane trip , every passenger is offered the kindergartner ’ s communion of juice and cooky , a if a majority of adult are incapable of going 90 minute without such provision . On train , passenger are treated a individual even more powerful than adult : independent teenager who just want to smoke . Amtrak know you want to smoke . Amtrak know you love to smoke . But while you ’ re living under Amtrak ’ s roof , you have to follow the rule , of which there is only one , and that is : Don ’ t smoke inside .
 “ Albany is going to be a smoke break , ” a young male voice declared over the intercom a the train hurtled northward . “ Just a reminder , lady and gentleman , ” a voice like that of a female jazz radio D.J . warned on a westbound train . “ This is a completely nonsmoking train. ” She added : “ Your first official stop for a smoke break is Kansas City , Mo . ”
 In winter , the 3:40 Lake Shore Limited experience just 90 minute of daylight before darkness descends for a majority of it journey west to Chicago . The first leg of the trip follows the Hudson River , revealing glimpse of hidden island and idyllic ruin — like the crumbling remains of a fanciful 20th-century castle built by an arm dealer in need of an out-of-the-way place to stash his store of live ammunition , some of which eventually exploded , creating the crumbling remains . At sunset , when all that wa left of the day wa a tangelo slash along the horizon , that same color flashed up from partly melted ice crater that caught the light a the train chugged past . Suddenly , the air outside the train became crow — thousand of crow , rushing in from all angle and alighting on the blue-white frozen river , a if deposited there by an unseen hand .
 Sleep the first night came easily and , a it wa interrupted several time , frequently . After performing the traditional nighttime ritual of climbing atop the toilet and carefully catapulting into bed , I wa rewarded with the gentle rocking of a hammock experiencing a constant minor earthquake tremor . The atmosphere on board wa librarylike ; even the periodic train whistle sounded very far away , a if in someone else ’ s dream .
 [ How to spend 47 hour on a train and not go crazy . ]
 The most unifying characteristic of my fellow passenger wa not age ( although , a a rule , the sleeping car skewed retired ) , race ( very mixed ) , income ( while sleeper are astronomically priced , coach seat can be downright economical for shorter segment ) or even fear of flying ( no one I spoke to had it ) ; it wa their relaxed , easygoing , train-lulled contentment . To opt to travel long distance via Amtrak — a method deemed “ on time ” just 71.2 percent of the time by it own generous metric — is to say : As long a I get there eventually , I ’ m satisfied .
 Train people are content to stare out the window for hour , like indoor cat . The trouble with the Lake Shore Limited is that the amount of enjoyment it is possible to derive from staring out the window of a train is inversely proportional to the population density of the land you are traversing . People need thing , and unfortunately most of those thing are ugly to look at . Many of them are gray . Views picked up considerably when , after a five-hour layover in Chicago , I transferred onto the Southwest Chief , a double-decker “ Superliner ” with many of it coach seat , sleeping quarter and lounge on the top level . Sightseer Lounges are the crown jewel of Amtrak ’ s long-distance train : entire car of retro-futuristic curved floor-to-ceiling window where passenger can sit at table or outward-facing upholstered chair and watch the scenery streak by . Shortly into it route , the Chief pass the single best thing in the United States : a silo in Mendota , Ill. , with an 80-by-20-foot ear of corn painted on one side .
 Train people are also individual for whom small talk is a invigorating a a rail of cocaine . For them , every meal on board Amtrak ( communal seating like a Benihana , reservation only , included with the price of a sleeping-car ticket , check in with the dining-car attendant ) is a rager . A white middle-aged man in motorcycle gear discussed leukemia treatment with a swish black grandmother . Another man , while gathering up armful of research book from a table , bid farewell to a farmer and suggested that he might run into him on the same train next year . I wa seated at dinner with an Amish couple traveling to Arizona for a construction job , and by the time our Amtrak Signature Steaks with optional Béarnaise sauce arrived ( the food is on a par with the fourth-best airplane meal you could ever imagine ) , we were deep in a conversation about one of my favorite topic , which is myself . I offered a tip I ’ d learned about cleaning up glitter using dryer sheet , and they laughed a they tried to envision a situation in which this information could ever be useful .
 “ ‘ Who told you that ? ’ ” the husband asked himself , anticipating companion ’ question . “ ‘ Some girl that writes in The New York Times ! ’ ”
 “ They ’ d never believe u , ” mused his wife , who had ordered cheesecake for dinner .
 At another meal , my table mate were a Missouri-based retired physician and her husband , a retired special-ed teacher , plus a retired architect from Arizona who wa traveling alone . In the middle of a conversation about how they met their spouse , the architect suddenly seemed preoccupied with his iPhone . “ I read one where it said , ” he muttered into his chest , “ ‘ Keep your photo of your wife when you met her. ’ ” He lifted the phone and showed the table his lock screen : a black-and-white photo of a beautiful young woman in 1960s dress . I barely managed not to cry into my Land & Sea entree ( Amtrak Signature Steak with optional Béarnaise sauce , plus additional crab , shrimp and scallop cake ) .
 Back in my warm little room , there wa something I couldn ’ t put my finger on that made it subtly nicer than my Lake Shore Limited accommodation , and that wa the in-room toilet , because this roomette did not have one . I had been given a stationary pointing tour of the compartment by the Chief ’ s sleeping-car attendant — a middle-aged woman from a small town in Mexico , who , like every Amtrak attendant with whom I interacted over the course of three day , hummed along with the unflustered friendliness of a benevolent spirit continuing to go about it business in a hotel decade after the property ha been converted into luxury condo . Her soothing voice made everything she said sound like the hurried recitation of a familiar recipe . Her assessment of me — “ You are on vacation , you probably want to close the curtain and sleep and sleep , wake up and eat and then go and take another nap , it ’ s O.K. , that ’ s why you are on vacation ” — wa delivered all in one breath .
 Kansas share a border with Colorado . I never could have imagined that I would one day say this , and I know many people will be disconcerted by the statement . They will wonder if , this whole time , they have been reading an avant-garde work of science fiction , or perhaps a Mad Lib . “ Is magical realism always this scary ? ” they will ask themselves . Some will claim I am lying . Many will assume I am wrong , demented or a clumsy typist .
 To all of whom I respond : The truth of our nation ’ s internal demarcation is stranger than fiction — stranger than even the kind of brilliant avant-garde science fiction I am most likely capable of producing yet choose not to . But the unvarnished fact is Colorado ha to start somewhere , and for whatever reason , that ’ s inside Kansas .
 I woke in Colorado to a weather phenomenon called the pogonip — freezing fog that condensed on tree limb and sagebrush until they looked dusted with powdered sugar . The terrain of the Colorado tableland is so flat that it seemed possible to detect the exact location where the pogonip ended and blue sky began , the margin of the changing landscape revealing themselves a definitively a gutter between panel of a newspaper comic .
 A childlike compulsion to identify distant cow rippled through the observation car a we hurried along . So fast did we fly past baby deer that the “ aw ! ” s caught in our throat . Whichever way you face , you are privy to an all-day show , although there is a nagging sensation that by being focused in one direction , you are missing something spectacular unfolding in another . Sometimes you are . Sometimes other people will even tell you you are , like when a grizzled stranger sat down next to me , close enough to be way too close , jerked his head behind u , growled , “ That ’ s Pikes Peak ” and walked away . Unknown to me , on the north side of the train , the Rockies had just begun to loom up out of the prairie .
 Azure and golden orange were the color of the afternoon . Action-movie poster are dominated by this color combination , famous for it vibrancy , and indeed , a horizon filled with just these hue seemed to draw the Sightseer Lounge into a kind of trance . For a long while there wa nothing but sky and earth to observe — I saw actual tumbleweed somersault by — yet everyone , me included , remained riveted to the window . It wa possible , in the Sightseer Lounge , to watch weather roll in from a great distance , even from one side of the car to the other . As we ascended hill covered in pinyon and juniper , flake began to fall , and soon we were in a winter forest . As quickly a we had entered the snowscape , however , we were back in dusty New Mexican grassland , rolling through a hailstorm of white bird .
 Sunset pushed the denizen of the Sightseer Lounge to the brink of insanity , a all but the Amish frantically tried to capture the flame-colored sky on our cellphone camera . A companionable mother I met earlier in the day , accompanying her own parent on a casino trip to Nevada , dashed from another car to make sure I wa facing out of the best side of the lounge to photograph the heaven . When the sun dipped below the horizon , the sky turned the color of wet slate , then dark denim blue with a pale apricot smear that we chased west for several mile .
 Scale on a rail trip is what ’ s most arresting . We live so much of our life close-up — scrolling through phone , watching our type appear on computer screen , scrutinizing paper , preparing meal , cleaning our home room by room . Very few element of our day-to-day task remain out of arm ’ reach . An extended train ride affords a chance not just to see a horizon but also to soak it up . To luxuriate in the far-off for uninterrupted hour . To exist , briefly , in the uncharted section of the cellphone-coverage map .
 And it feel a if you ’ re getting away with something — seeing more than you deserve . The best part of the trip wasn ’ t spying on the backyard of house ; it wa out here , in the open . The bright hue of the nation ’ s choropleth population-density map fade to white in these area , yet many of the most beautiful habitable part of the United States , no offense to Boston , are contained within those colorless expanse . Amtrak take advantage of this circumstance . It is fortunate that it route were laid during a period of industrious optimism , when everyone assumed the West would soon be made a unbearable a the East ; if they had known it would remain beautiful , it would have been difficult to justify the financial investment .
 Lying in my berth , I felt a happy a an egg in an incubator with no plan to hatch . My mood wa so upbeat that when I spotted a vitamin on the carpet , I optimistically assumed it wa the one I ’ d been keeping in my pocket for week but forgetting to take , and I popped it in my mouth , reminding myself to look up the writing stamped on it later . It turned out to have been a supplement for adult 50 and over . I had become train-lulled .
 When I awoke on the third day , we were about an hour behind schedule . It had happened , our attendant explained , when assistance for a handicapped passenger wa slow to arrive at an overnight stop . “ We can ’ t rush them ! ” she chided ( referring , presumably , to the passenger rather than the assistance ) , though delay appeared to have dampened no mood ; it meant that the sun rose over the San Bernardino Mountains at breakfast . As we approached our final destination , the scenery deteriorated , the red rock vista replaced by heap of wooden pallet stacked in strip-mall parking lot . When we pulled into the last stop on the line , the train wa almost empty . I had surveyed thousand of mile of panoramic splendor , and I couldn ’ t believe I had come all that way just to get to Los Angeles .

 A weeklong trip in Alaska wa supposed to be an adventure . In an instant , it became the experience that defined u all .

 DAVID BENJAMIN SHERRY
 The whale sighting happened right away , minute into Day 1 . Jon , Dave and I had just been dropped off on a remote Alaskan shoreline , an hour and a half by boat from the closest speck of a town . Jon wa working a a sea-kayaking guide that summer in Glacier Bay National Park , and he had invited u up for a seven-day excursion during his week off . As the boat that delivered u vanished , the drone of it engine dampening into a murmur and then finally trailing off , it became unthinkably quiet on the beach , and the largeness and strangeness of our surroundings were suddenly apparent . It wa a familiar phenomenon for Jon from the start of all his trip : a moment that people instinctually paused to soak in . To me , it felt like those scene of astronaut who , having finally rattled free of the earth ’ s atmosphere , slip into the stillness of space . Except we weren ’ t in space . We were on earth — finally , really on earth .
 We were only starting to move around again , packing our gear into the kayak , when we heard the first huff of a blowhole , not far offshore .
 Jon wa ecstatic . It seemed to him a if the animal were putting on a show , swimming playfully in the kelp , diving , resurfacing , then plowing it open mouth across the surface to feed . He took it a a good omen . Though I had no idea at the time , he wa anxious that Dave and I might feel intimidated about making the trip ; such a big payoff , so quickly , would get u excited and defuse any apprehension .
 For Dave , the whale-sighting had exactly the opposite effect . Once , when he wa a kid , his dad took him scuba diving with dolphin . They were friendly , awe-inspiring creature , purportedly , but they terrified Dave instead . He could still conjure the feeling of hanging defenselessly in that water while the animal deftly swirled around him , le like solid object than flash of reflected light , while he could move only in comparative slow-motion . Ever since , he had harbored a fear of large sea creature — a niche phobia , particularly for a young man who lived in the Bronx , but a genuine one still . And so , even a Dave understood that a chance to see whale up close like this wa a major draw of a kayaking trip in Alaska , and though he feigned being thrilled , some second thought were kicking in : We were going out there , he realized .
 The whale left me exhilarated and gleeful , like Jon ; but deeper down , I also remember feeling shaken , like Dave . Nothing about the animal registered to me a playful or welcoming . It just appeared in the distance , then transited quickly past u , from left to right . My uneasiness had something to do with the whale ’ s great size and indifference — it obliviousness — a it passed . Watching it made me feel profoundly out of place and register how large that wilderness wa , relative to me .
 At the time , I wa working at a literary magazine in New York City called The Hudson Review , picking poem out of the slush pile and mailing them to an outside panel of editorial adviser . I wa trying hard in my letter to impress one of them : Hayden Carruth , a gruff and irreverent 81-year-old poet who lived far upstate . I loved Carruth ’ s work but wa more enamored with his persona : his yeoman life in the wood , his intolerance for phoniness and , most of all , the precision with which he articulated common suffering , including one strain of his own suffering that I related to , particularly in those year , but wouldn ’ t have had the courage , or clarity , to examine .
 “ I had always been aware , ” Carruth once wrote of his youth , “ that the Universe is sad ; everything in it , animate or inanimate , the wild creature , the stone , the star , wa enveloped in the great sadness , pervaded by it . ... Never then or now have I been able to look at a cloudless sky at night and see beauty there . A kind of grandeur , yes — but not beauty . The profusion and variety of celestial light have always frightened me . Why are they there ? Why these instead of others ? Why these instead of nothing ? ”
 That wa how I felt , watching the whale from the beach : afraid that everything wa accident . Then again , maybe it ’ s just hard to picture the start of the trip in retrospect without amplifying some feeling of foreboding . Something else Carruth wrote that ha always stuck with me : “ The wilderness begin at the edge of my body , at the edge of my consciousness , and extends to the edge of the universe , and it is filled with menace . ”

 It wa mid-August 2002 , and we were 23 , 24 and 25 . We had graduated from college together two year earlier . Dave , whom I also grew up with , shot out of undergrad knowing he wanted to be a doctor and had just finished his first year of medical school . Any similar momentum I had after graduation wa instantly sapped . Three night after I returned to my parent ’ house from school , I found myself driving my father to the emergency room . Three week after that , he died . My grief wa disorienting and total ; at a moment in life when everything is supposed to feel possible , making any single decision became impossible . I gave into that sadness for the better part of a year , resettling at home in New Jersey with my widowed mother and sliding back to the summer job I worked during school , glumly breaking down beef at a butcher shop two town over .
 I coped with my fatherlessness and confusion in way I ’ m not proud of and still don ’ t understand . I read a lot of book about Ronald Reagan , for example , even the collection of his love letter to Nancy . I also lashed out at Dave , who wa living at home that summer , too , studying for the MCAT . He withdrew awkwardly after the funeral , and I suppose I wa happy to hold that against him . It triggered some longstanding jealousy . A part of me always resented how he seemed unfairly exempt from the self-doubt and heaviness that I wa prone to .
 Jon , meanwhile , wa teaching at a rustic little boarding school in Switzerland , where his mother wa from . The summer after graduation , before starting the job , he set out for Alaska with a friend , sleeping in the bed of their old pickup . In the minuscule town of Gustavus , the gateway to Glacier Bay , he picked up seasonal work in the warehouse of a kayak-tour company . Jon had little actual experience of sea kayaking but had always felt drawn to the ocean in the abstract . In college , he and another friend plotted out a paddling expedition near Glacier Bay , across the border in Canada and applied for a grant from our school to fund it . The grant wa set up in memory of an alumnus who died in an avalanche while mountaineering . It wa meant to encourage the “ responsible and conscientious pursuit of wilderness expeditions. ” Safety wa key . But the committee rejected Jon and his partner ’ s application . They seemed insufficiently prepared .
 That wasn ’ t surprising . Jon grew up doing a lot of backcountry camping and wa a competent outdoorsman , but putting together a grant application required a kind of administrative fastidiousness he didn ’ t always posse . He wa bright but scatterbrained , forever picking up thing and putting them down , both figuratively ( music project , conversation ) but also literally . I can still picture him hustling around the house we shared in college , hunting for his key or his soldering iron , having gotten in over his head rewiring some device . He wa an artist ; one piece I remember consisted of a half-peeled banana , implanted with circuitry and suspended in a jar of formaldehyde . Once , he grew grass in our upstairs bathroom — a living bathmat , he said — until the turf became muddy and flooded the downstairs .
 This wa Jon ’ s third summer in Alaska , and he ’ d worked his way up to leading expedition , taking out vacationer for day at a time . Our trip , however , would venture beyond the typical circuit , into a remote corner of the park that he ’ d never been to . Jon had no serious concern about our safety , but he felt he bore responsibility for our emotional well-being . To enjoy ourselves , we would need to feel comfortable , not just in the wilderness but also with him a a leader .
 He suspected we wouldn ’ t trust him entirely . We didn ’ t . We knew him before he became a professional guide , and our perception of his expertise lagged behind the reality . “ With Jon , ” Dave told me , “ it wa always unclear to what extent he ’ d thought everything through. ” Dave remembered landing in Gustavus the night before we got underway and casually asking Jon a lot of question : Where are we going , exactly ? Do we have everything we need ? Jon seemed to have solid answer for all of them . As we headed back to his place for a good night ’ s sleep , he told u to wait in the yard . He wa living alone for the summer in a house that an acquaintance wa building in the wood . The structure wa framed-up but largely wall-less , and Jon , to be safe , needed to check that no moose had wandered in .
 After a spectacular first day of paddling , we came ashore on a rocky tidal flat about two mile from where we were dropped . Jon gave u his detailed tutorial about bear safety while we set up our campsite . He taught u , for example , to holler “ Hey , bear ! ” if we heard any rustling but also preventively , ahead of u , when we walked through the wood . The last thing you wanted wa to come across a brown bear unannounced .
 “ Hey , bear ! ” Jon kept hollering , by way of demonstration . He said it goofily , like a child ’ s TV host greeting some down-on-his-luck ursine neighbor at the doorway to their clubhouse . This wa intentional . Jon had noticed that the people on his trip often resisted bellowing “ Hey , bear ! ” into the wilderness . It wa essential for their safety , but it felt silly or vulnerable somehow , like singing in public . So he learned to turn it into a shtick , spinning it into a stream-of-consciousness narration : Hey , bear , I ’ m coming into the tree now . Hope you ’ re having a fantastic evening , Mr. Bear ! It loosened everyone up . They were performing for their friend now ; the whole group wa in on the joke .
 I had never seen a wild bear , though I have backpacked in bear country a handful of time . I felt comfortable with the animal in the abstract . But here , the bear weren ’ t abstract ; they breached the material plane . There were bear trail everywhere , leading from the tree line to the water , and disquietingly close , I felt , to where we were pitching our tent . We found heap of their scat . We saw tree where the animal had slashed off the bark to eat the inner layer , tuft of fur from their paw still plastered in the sap .
 I pretended I wa having fun . But that evening I grew increasingly petrified , almost delirious . My eye tightened , scanning for bear . The sound of the wind became bear , and so did the mossy stick cracking under our foot . I gave myself a migraine , then phased in and out of sleep .
 At sunrise , I woke feeling foolish . While Jon cooked pancake , I reasoned with myself , privately , in a notebook I brought on the trip . I tried to conceive of the situation a a geometry problem . Yes , some number of bear roved this landscape , I wrote : relatively tiny , independent blip , going about their business randomly , just like u . In all that empty space and confusion , a lethal collision of their moving blip and our moving blip would be an improbable coincidence . I ’ d been distorting those odds , mistaking myself for “ the absolute focus of all bear ’ attention , ” I wrote . It wa embarrassing , really . “ To be afraid of bear , ” I concluded , “ is to be narcissistic . ”
 I wa reminding myself that freakishly horrible thing are , by definition , unlikely to happen . Even now , my reasoning feel sound .
 [ Read about the search for a missing hiker in Joshua Tree ’ s wild interior . ]
 Day 2 wa a slog . We paddled through a spitting drizzle in an endless straight line , along the high granite wall of the coast . We talked le and le , just pushed through the emerald chop . Then eventually we gave up , hauling in our boat and making camp in a wide , crescent-shaped cove , short of the site that Jon originally picked out on his map .
 We had entered Dundas Bay , a rarely visited pocket of the national park that , I ’ ve since learned , ha a storied history a a hide-out for solitary misanthrope . In the 1930s , one prospector built a cabin not far from our campsite and brandished a gun at the Alaska Natives who passed through .
 We intuited that the scenery wa beautiful , but we could see very little of it through the fog . Our guidebook explained that “ the east side of the bay ” — where we were — “ can get extremely rough during foul weather , since large wave roll in ... and batter this shoreline. ” That wa happening now : The weather that plinked at u all afternoon wa roiling into a storm . Soon , the big rain started . We rushed through dinner , then loafed in our tent until , eventually , the loafing turned to sleep .
 A local newspaper would later describe the storm a “ short but intense. ” In Gustavus , a creek swelled to about a foot higher than it previous record . Gale wind , with gust up to 59 mile per hour , turned back two cruise ship in Skagway , about 85 mile north . Around 2 a.m. , we woke to discover the wind had shorn the rain fly off our tent . Jon ’ s sleeping bag and mine were soaked , while Dave wa snug and dry between u . We heard torrent of water lashing down and the wave crashing in the cove .
 We got up three or four hour later . The rain and wind no longer felt ferocious but were still too gnarly to paddle through ; there wa no question , Jon said , that we were staying put . We cooked breakfast and took turn playing chess in the tent . By late morning , the storm seemed to have passed . We were antsy . We figured we would take a look around .
 The terrain wa crammed with thicket of alder and spruce , underlain by fern and a furor of prickly thing . Jon pointed out devil ’ s club : three or four foot tall and leafy , armored up and down with spine . The plant pierced fleece and hurt like fire .
 There were no trail . We ’ d been trudging for some time when we reached a fast-moving stream , maybe 10 foot wide . Jon wa surprised ; it wasn ’ t on his map , most likely just a drainage bloated by the storm . We followed it downstream , looking for a way across , and eventually found it bridged by a hefty tree trunk . It seemed like an easy crossing . Jon stepped up and led the way , and Dave and I waited in a single-file line on the stream bank behind him . The creek wa loud , like a factory with all it gear and roller churning . Looking down , Jon realized there wa more water than he ’ d thought .
 That ’ s when I heard the snap in the wood behind me . After all my paranoia , I instantly understood that the many bear I ’ d thought I heard before were absolutely not bear — were nothing — because this sound wa so unmistakable and crisp , so explicitly something . I turned and hollered , “ Hey , bear ! ” then waited a beat . Maybe I said “ Hey , bear ! ” again ; I ’ m not sure . But I must have scanned those tree long enough to feel satisfied and safe , because I know I wa turning my head , to go back to my friend , when I saw the dark shape rushing forward in my peripheral vision .
 What I heard must have been root popping . If a tree is large enough , you can apparently hear them cracking underground like gunfire .
 The thud wa seismic . The trunk crashed down right next to me . Mapping out bit of evidence later , we concluded that the tree must have been about 80 foot tall and perhaps two foot in diameter . It wa some kind of conifer — a spruce or cedar . I screamed , involuntarily , “ Look out ! ” then watched Dave , a few step directly in front of me , dive sideways and hit the ground . When I got to him , he wa crouching , stunned but O.K . He looked up and said , “ Go get Jon . ”
 It hadn ’ t clicked back in for me : There were three of u . The sight of Dave going down had canceled out everything else . I scrambled out over the creek , running across the tree that had just fallen , shouting Jon ’ s name , then spotted him in the water , tangled in a snarl of sheared-off branch near the bank behind me — a cage , which kept him from hurtling downstream .
 He did not know he ’ d been hit by a falling tree . It had narrowly missed his head , struck his left shoulder , shearing it from his collarbone and breaking many of his rib . Later , a doctor would explain that the downward force had been so powerful that it had probably squashed Jon ’ s entire upper body , and all the organ inside , down toward his waist , momentarily compressing him like a bellow ; for a split second , his shoulder headed in the direction of his bellybutton , before his torso sprang up again .
 Jon had heard nothing , seen nothing . He wa turning around to help Dave onto the log — again , feeling responsible for our safety — and the next thing he knew , he wa in the water . He tried to reach out his left arm but could not make it move . He could not move his leg . He felt a bolt of pain down his spine .
 Jon later described flashing through an idiosyncratic sequence of thought , all in a few millisecond , a if watching a deck of card fanning across a table . One wa an image of himself in a wheelchair , sitting behind a mixing console in a fancy recording studio . “ I guess I can become a recording engineer in a wheelchair , ” he remembered thinking . He had never worked in a recording studio and , though he played music , he had no particular plan to . Still , this vision apparently felt like an acceptable future and freed him to resurface in the present . That wa when he registered me , screaming his name .
 Jon told himself he shouldn ’ t move . He knew from his many wilderness first-responder training that moving a person with spinal injury risk paralysis . Then again , he also knew that most of his body wa submerged in cold water , and he recognized that he risked dying of hypothermia if he didn ’ t move . “ If I ’ m already paralyzed , ” he concluded , “ I may a well move . ”
 He somehow hoisted himself out of the stream before Dave or I got to him , using his right arm and his chin and biting into something loamy with his teeth , for additional leverage . He reassessed the situation : better . Also : worse . He now realized that we were at least a mile inland from our camp .
 Suddenly , his body wa walking ; his leg just started working . Dave and I put him between u , supporting his frame . He wa moving faster than we expected , but uncoordinatedly . Then he crumpled between u . We tried again ; Jon wa dead weight . Dave noticed that his breathing wa shallow and his voice wa low — sign , Dave knew from med school , of a collapsed lung . He began battering Jon with a pep talk , telling him , firmly , that he had to get up , that we had to get out of here . Jon didn ’ t need that explained to him ; he wa cogent and still trying to plot our next step in his mind . He looked down to see why this log he wa resting on wa so lumpy and realized that he wa , in fact , sitting on his left arm . The arm wa slack , obviously broken ; his sleeve , pierced up and down with devil ’ s club . Jon had zero feeling in it . He found it amusing , this sensation of complete estrangement from one of his limb .
 Jon had been stressing that it wa important to stay together . But this wa another theory of wilderness survival that appeared to be breaking down in practice . Someone would have to get on the radio back at our camp . By chance , while marooned in our tent during the rainstorm the night before , Jon showed u how to use the device , though he did it almost a a formality ; the hand-held VHF unit wa merely a line-of-sight radio , he told u , meaning it range wa small , it signal too weak to pas through most obstacle . You were unlikely to reach anyone you couldn ’ t see , and we hadn ’ t seen anyone since a faraway fishing boat , early on Day 1 .
 There wa a moment of discussion , or maybe just an exchange of look between me and Dave . I told Dave he should go . I didn ’ t trust myself to find my way back . I also knew that I lacked the courage to try ; whether I wa being sensible or cowardly , I still don ’ t know . Besides , I took for granted that Dave would make it . He wa more capable in my mind , le likely to cinch himself in indecisive knot .
 Recently , though , Dave told me : “ You probably had no idea how much in my own head I wa . I know that you , growing up , definitely felt insecure about thing , and I think you looked at me and thought , Dave ha everything figured out . But I had so much anxiety. ” He brought up the tremor he used to have in his hand . I knew about it ; in high school , we waited table together , and I occasionally had to carry out Dave ’ s soup order , so he wouldn ’ t spill . But I guess I thought of the tremor a strictly physiological . I couldn ’ t see the vulnerability causing it .
 Now , a Dave sprinted away from me and Jon , swatting devil ’ s club from his path with the rubberized sleeve of his rain jacket , his nerve rose up and rattled him . He worried he wouldn ’ t be able to find the radio once he got back or know how to turn it on . What if he broke the radio , foreclosing whatever marginal chance we had of getting help ? There were lot of way to screw this up , Dave realized . More occurred to him a he ran .
 He found the radio . He turned it on . Then , having solved these problem , he encountered another he hadn ’ t anticipated : “ What is the appropriate thing you ’ re supposed to say ? ” he remembered thinking . On TV , you see a lot of people saying “ Mayday. ” And so , Dave faced the open water and started broadcasting into the fog : “ Mayday , Mayday. ” Even in that moment , though , alone on a beach in the middle of nowhere , he felt slightly self-conscious about it . This is so goddamn cliché , he thought .
 Back in the wood , kneeling over Jon , I wa having the same problem : I didn ’ t know what to say . He wa lying near a log on his injured side , his beard and glass flecked with dirt and tendril of moss . He seemed to be on the brink of losing consciousness . At no time would the possibility of Jon ’ s dying surface concretely in any of our mind . Still , I knew I wa supposed to keep talking to him , to tether him to the world with my voice somehow .
 I started vamping platitude : We were going to get out of here soon , and so forth . But I could feel myself treading water , even blundering , at one point , into a long-winded apology , worried I overstayed my welcome that one Christmas with his family . I wa afraid that the helplessness in my voice might be counterproductive , unsettling Jon instead of steadying him . It wa a tremendous silence to fill .
 What can a person say ? I had two literature professor in college who made u memorize poem . You never knew when some line of verse would come in handy , they claimed . One liked to brag that , while traveling through Ireland , he found that if he spat out some Yeats at a pub , he could drink free . This is how I wound up reciting a love poem to Jon .
 It wa “ The Shampoo , ” by Elizabeth Bishop , a lyric poem about the enormity of time , which turn startlingly intimate at the end , when Bishop offer to shampoo her lover ’ s silvering hair : “ Come , let me wash it in this big tin basin , /battered and shiny like the moon . ”
 After that , I imagine I also did some W.H . Auden ; I knew a fair amount of Auden back then . The stuff in rhyme and meter wa always easiest to memorize — “ Looking up at the star , I know quite well/That , for all they care , I can go to hell ” — which is why I had a lot of Robert Frost at my disposal a well : “ Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening , ” “ The Road Not Taken. ” For the most part , I trafficked in hit .
 Jon and I would spend about an hour and a half together alone on the forest floor . I ran through everything in my quiver — Kay Ryan , A.R . Ammons , Michael Donaghy — padding each poem with little prefatory remark , while Jon said nothing , just signaled with his eye or produced a sound whenever I checked in . I felt like a radio D.J . playing record in the middle of the night , unsure if anyone wa listening . And here ’ s one about owl by Richard Wilbur , I would tell Jon , and off we would go .
 I must have also done at least one by Hayden Carruth , my curmudgeonly pen pal at the literary magazine . Carruth ’ s poem didn ’ t lend themselves to memorization , but I ’ d worked hard to nail one of my favorite , in which he describes stopping to notice a deer standing in an apple thicket , then realizing the northern light are flaring overhead . Hayden and the animal pas a moment in stillness together . “ We are proud to be afraid , ” he writes , “ proud to share/the silent magnetic storm that destroys the stars. ” Relative to that boundless violence above them , he and the deer are momentarily allied , though still not entirely connected : “ a glimpse , an acknowledgment/it is enough and never enough . ”
 That ’ s what I said to my friend , powerlessly , tenting my jacket over his face when it started to rain . The title of the poem is : “ I Know , I Remember , But How Can I Help You . ”
 The Coast Guard cutter Mustang wasn ’ t where it wa supposed to be . The 110-foot patrol boat normally spent it time coursing through the Gulf of Alaska , inspecting halibut-fishing vessel , or circulating , a a terrorist deterrent , near the oil terminal at Valdez . It wa home-ported in Seward , hundred of mile from Glacier Bay . But the crew wa transiting to Juneau for a training when , a few day earlier , they were smacked by the same storm that later poured inland , over u . “ We had gotten absolutely pummeled , ” John Roberts , a petty officer on the Mustang , told me recently . For two day , the boat swished around in 15-foot-plus sea . Many on the crew had been hunkered in the mess deck , vomiting , while Roberts and a couple of his shipmate did their best to cover everyone ’ s watch . Finally , the Mustang slipped into Glacier Bay to find some protection . The weather started to ease . That afternoon , a Roberts piloted the Mustang east , toward Dundas Bay , his pallid crewmates were finally staggering back up to the bridge , asking where the hell they were .
 That wa when Dave ’ s Mayday call came through . The signal on the Mustang ’ s radio wa thin and faint , barely edging into range . Another of the ship ’ s petty officer , Eamon McCormack , explained to me that in retrospect the connection feel “ mind-boggling. ” Glacier Bay National Park extends over more than 5,000 square mile . Our signal would have covered two or three mile at most . And yet , a boat — a Coast Guard boat , no le — happened to be passing through that exceedingly small window at precisely the right time . “ I don ’ t know if , nine time out of 10 , you play that over again and the outcome would be the same , ” McCormack said . A moment earlier or later — second , potentially — and we might have slipped out of alignment . The moving boat would have cruised out of range , uncoupling from u forever .


 It wa 1:25 p.m. when the Mustang received Dave ’ s call , according to one of the subsequent Coast Guard report . Roberts couldn ’ t believe it . “ Come on , man , I ’ m tired , ” he said aloud , wearily , to the receiver in front of him . Roberts waited for a moment , per protocol , on the off chance that the Coast Guard ’ s central communication center in Juneau would pick up the call instead . Then he turned and asked his watch commander to pull out all the standardized search-and-rescue paperwork . He wa steeling himself , resummoning his professionalism . “ I guess we ’ re doing this , ” he said .
 Roberts wa the crew member on the Mustang with the most current medical training ; he would complete his E.M.T . certification the following month . As he started firing question at Dave on the radio , he didn ’ t like the answer that he heard coming back : the shallowness of Jon ’ s breathing , the likelihood of a punctured lung . More fundamental , Roberts remembered : “ Any time a tree fall on somebody , it ’ s not good. ” He wa also unsettled to learn that Dave and I both lived in New York City — a red flag , he had found , when someone wind up in trouble in the wilderness .
 We were 100 nautical mile from the nearest hospital ; a half-day trip , even in ideal condition . The Mustang requested that the Coast Guard Air Station in Sitka send a helicopter , but the immediate plan wa for Roberts and three crewmates to peel toward shore in the ship ’ s Zodiac and track u down . Dave had found the flare in Jon ’ s emergency kit and now , at 2:20 , with the Zodiac underway , the Coast Guard asked him to fire it . He wa still in front of our campsite , facing the water . He ’ d never shot off a flare before . He aimed straight up , then watched a the bright tracer rose and arced somewhere far behind him , deep in the wood . He wa uncertain whether this counted a a success . He started scanning the fog in front of him , but the Zodiac never appeared .
 Someone on the Mustang caught sight of the flare near the end of it arc and immediately directed the crew on the Zodiac toward it , steering them far away from Dave to the opposite side of the little peninsula we ’ d camped on . And yet , this wa lucky : they wound up coming ashore much closer to where I wa waiting in the wood with Jon . Soon , whatever poem I wa reciting wa interrupted by whistle blowing and voice calling , and eventually three shape , wearing hard hat and heavy orange rain gear , rushed toward u out of the tree .
 Roberts wa especially impressive , a reassuringly large Boston-area native with a booming voice . He knelt and took Jon ’ s vitals . The information wa troubling : his pulse wa 60 beat per minute ; his breathing , fast and shallow . They put his neck in a brace and eased him onto a kind of truncated backboard , called a Miller board , to move him out to the beach . Dave had returned by then . He and I crouched at one end of the board , near Jon ’ s foot , a someone — presumably Roberts — bellowed a count of three to lift .
 Later that night , lying down to sleep in a bed-and-breakfast in Gustavus — stunned and depleted , but dry and warm — Dave and I would talk and talk , reviewing the entire ordeal . We had drooped into a long silence , coasting toward sleep , when Dave spoke up with one last observation . When we were getting ready to lift Jon on the backboard , he said , it occurred to him that this wa one of those crisis moment you hear about , like when mother are suddenly able to lift a car off their baby . Dave expected we were going to have superhuman strength .
 We did not have superhuman strength . On Roberts ’ s command , the men raised Jon to waist height , swiftly and seemingly perfectly level , a though their arm and deltoid were hydraulic . Then , in one motion , they took off downhill , with negligible help from u . This can ’ t be accurate , but I remember the sensation of being almost dragged , like child in a sled .
 A National Geographic television crew wa embedded at the Coast Guard ’ s air station in Sitka , filming an installment of a thrill-ride reality series . The network had sent crew to other Coast Guard station around the country too , though this assignment appeared to hold the most dramatic potential . Air Station Sitka wa unique : Its pilot were responsible for 12,000 mile of coastline , a sprawling , treacherous wilderness riven with fjord , inlet and glacier , often buffeted by implacably horrible weather . People who went into the backcountry in Alaska had a way of getting themselves into a different magnitude of trouble , too ; a Roberts put it , “ When stuff happens in Alaska , it ’ s big. ” Still , this wa the television crew ’ s eighth day in Sitka , and a the show ’ s producer , Annabelle Hester , explained : “ I wa having call with my boss at headquarters saying , ‘ Nothing is happening ! ’ We were scrambling to come up with Plan B. ” Then , the Mustang ’ s call came in at 1:42 .
 “ What type of injury are we looking at ? ” asked the dispatcher . She wa taking the call from behind a semicircular counter , like the reception desk at a midlevel corporate branch office . She had a framed snapshot of a parakeet to brighten her work space , and a photograph of a dog with a heart that said , “ I Woof You. ” A cameraman stood conspicuously beside her , holding a tense , tight shot .
 “ Probable broken rib , a definite broken arm , ” said the man on the other end . Then his voice faltered , seemed to give up : “ And whatever else would happen to you if a tree fell on you , ” he added .
 The dispatcher retrieved the appropriate paperwork and scribbled “ Tree fell on person ” on one line . She read the current weather aloud : “ 30 knot wind , 300 ceiling , heavy rain and one-mile vis. ” That would soon be revised : the ceiling had dropped to 100 foot . Entering the weather condition on one of the Coast Guard incident report , someone would write , in a kind of nihilistic catchall : “ Extremely terrible . ”
 The Coast Guard ’ s policy wa to deploy a helicopter within 30 minute of the initial request , but the Air Station ’ s operation officer , Cmdr . Karl Baldessari , informed everyone that this mission would take longer to plan . Baldessari wa a 25-year veteran of the Coast Guard , a fast-moving , sinewy man in a blousy flight suit , with a tidy mustache and spiky hair . His role at the air station wa that of a firehouse chief . He wa responsible for the safety of everyone working there , which meant making judicious decision about what warranted sending them hurtling through the sky .
 That calculus got knotty in condition like these , though there wa a baseline volatility to flying in Alaska at all . The Coast Guard didn ’ t let it helicopter pilot fly lead out of Sitka , no matter how much experience they had at other air station , until they practiced difficult landing at specific location in the region and got their ego battered a little by logging a full winter in the state . Visibility in Alaska wa frequently poor ; condition changed quickly . One pilot told me about blindly tunneling through fog in the dark when his co-pilot got “ caged ” : The man lifted his eye momentarily from his instrument and , without any visual reference or a horizon to latch onto , found it impossible to reorient himself , lost all sense of direction and wa felled by vertigo .
 During much of the year it wa also cold enough , with sufficient moisture in the air , that ascending to clear the region ’ s many minor mountain or even just flying through a cloud risked the aircraft ’ s icing up . To mitigate this , the Coast Guard had laid out virtual “ track line ” across the entirety of their range : a grid of GPS point and a network of path connecting them , along which pilot could chart a course and fly at a relatively low altitude , confident they weren ’ t going to smash into a mountain . The system wasn ’ t comprehensive ; the track line got the pilot close to their destination , but ultimately they had to diverge from this GPS superhighway and fly the remaining distance the old-fashioned way , with their radar and eye . It wa like taking an exit off the interstate , except there might be a granite wall in front of you wherever you chose to get off . It wa possible the pilot would travel very far — a half-mile away from whoever needed their help — only to discover that the last leg wa too risky and be forced to turn back .
 Baldessari gathered the two pilot on duty that afternoon and the Air Station ’ s flight surgeon , then unrolled a large paper map . He pointed to our location , explaining : “ That ’ s probably one of the lousiest place we fly in and out of . This Inian Pass , right here , is the worst place we could possibly go . ”
 Inian Pass is a slim channel near the center of the Icy Strait , the long , interconnected system of waterway stretching through Glacier Bay . Conditions in the Icy Strait can be bad 300 day of the year , Baldessari recently told me ; wind , rain and storm surge all push through it fast from the open ocean . But Inian Pass is a narrow keyhole at the center of the strait — a mile-wide opening between a few uninhabited island and a rocky point — where all that weather speed up . The only way for the pilot to reach u would be to fly straight through it .
 Nothing in the National Geographic footage , at this point , feel reassuring . The flight surgeon hold his hand over his mouth and bite his lip . The co-pilot , Chris Ferguson , only a few month into his posting in Alaska , mill around and fidget with his ear . It ’ s obvious Baldessari need convincing . He wasn ’ t eager to send his men up if he didn ’ t have to and wasn ’ t certain they would make it all the way there if he did .
 “ It ’ s kind of funny , ” he told the pilot , pointing at the map . “ You ’ ve got a boat right here . ”
 Lying on his backboard like a burl of driftwood , Jon wa conscious and cognizant of his pain , but he had started to feel somehow buffered from his body , uninterested in connecting with the world beyond it . He would later describe himself a a “ thinking blob . It wa a very passive experience. ” He didn ’ t know what wa happening but could tell our momentum had stalled . He wa confused and felt impatient . In his mind , the three of u had solved the impossible problem : We ’ d managed to get help . This wa supposed to be the simple part , when everyone rushed him to the hospital . Instead , his condition deteriorated . Within 10 minute of reaching the beach , Jon threw up . I ’ d never seen anything like it , a kind of dark purple gristle . I took out my wool cap to wipe his face , and he retched a second time , straight into my hat .
 “ I got that all over me , ” John Roberts told me recently . He ’ d seen vomit like that before ; it meant Jon had ingested a fair amount of blood and signaled internal injury . It made Roberts anxious . He had been on the Mustang for two and a half year at that point but had spent the previous four year in Palm Beach , a busy but le extreme posting that often involved rescuing weekend boater from relatively close to shore — and where , Roberts pointed out , the water is warm and won ’ t necessarily kill you if you go in . Moreover , the bulk of the Coast Guard ’ s training is for maritime rescue , not rescue on land . Counterintuitive a it sound , Roberts ’ s comfort level and confidence had dropped significantly once he hopped off the Zodiac and set foot on the beach .
 He reported back to the Mustang that Jon had thrown up , then soon radioed again , explaining that Jon wa going into shock . He kept giving and requesting update , trying to gauge how long this might take , and eventually started erecting a makeshift shelter out of plastic sheeting and medical tape , hoping to keep Jon out of the rain . Out of earshot of u , Roberts explained to his crew mate Eamon McCormack what the vomit meant : The possibility of Jon dying , here under their care , wa real . At one point in the National Geographic footage , a Roberts ’ s call are relayed to the air station in Sitka , you can see where the dispatcher clearly writes on her form : “ E.M.T . doe not feel comfortable . ”
 By this time , the air station ’ s flight surgeon had received enough information to be alarmed . “ It sound like he ’ s got a pretty significant chest injury , ” he told Baldessari . Baldessari understood they would need to launch a helicopter but warned the Mustang that the aircraft might not make it through the weather ; ultimately it would be the pilot ’ call , once they veered off their last track line and tried to shoot through Inian Pass .
 They would go and give it a look , Baldessari explained over the radio , but the outlook wa iffy . The guy on the beach , he said , must be prepared to get Jon back on their cutter and haul him to a hospital themselves , a fast a they could .
 One evening this winter , my phone rang , and it wa Karl Baldessari . Long retired from the Coast Guard , he wa teaching aviation at a community college in Oregon , where I left a voice mail message earlier that day . I meanwhile had metamorphosed into a 40-year-old father of two and fumbled to explain to Baldessari that , a thrilled a I wa to have tracked him down , I wa , at the moment , racing to finish a risotto for my daughter before gymnastics practice and would have to call him back . Without missing a beat , Baldessari blared order at me , joking , but still sounding a instinctually in charge a he did in the National Geographic footage : “ O.K. , ” he said , “ you want to stir it constantly , but slowly ! ”
 I didn ’ t expect any of the Coast Guardsmen I wa cold-calling to remember that day . However dramatic it remained for me , I assumed it would have been obscured in a yearslong wash of more sensational incident . But everyone I spoke to did remember it , immediately and in detail . Baldessari had been involved in hundred of rescue operation during his 30-year career , and yet , a I stood at the stove on the phone that evening , he told me : “ The moment I listened to your voice mail , I knew exactly the case ! It wa almost like it wa yesterday . ”
 There wa something about the supreme freakishness of the accident that left a lasting impression . For those who came ashore , the experience wa also marked by a feeling of subtly escalating chaos and the pressure to surmount it . McCormack told me that ours wa a story he retold endlessly , often to the younger Coast Guardsmen he wa eventually tasked with training . In it wa a lesson about “ not taking situation that look impossible at face value , ” he said . “ When thing start to go wrong , don ’ t panic or lose sight of what resource you ’ ve got. ” Keep working the problem until it absolute end — even , McCormack added , if it mean deviating from official policy .


 McCormack wa not supposed to be landing an inflatable boat on an unforgivably rocky Alaskan shoreline , for example . But there he wa , anyway , beaching the Zodiac a gingerly a he could , so that Roberts and the other men could load Jon aboard . They slid him in on his side “ like a folder into a filing cabinet , ” a Jon put it , and started motoring through the chop , very cautiously , back to the Mustang , about a mile away .
 As relieved a Jon had been when the Coast Guard first arrived , he also felt instantaneously more vulnerable . Strapped to the back board , his neck in the collar , he surrendered control of his body , however imperfect that control had been . He wa being hauled around a an object now , with no ability to wriggle or shift position , to manage his pain or even to turn his head and see what wa happening . He wa helpless , entirely dependent on the upright people operating around him , those voice he could hear discussing him on the far side of some gauzy divide . About 10 minute into the trip on the Zodiac , Jon heard one of those voice say , “ Oh , shit , we ’ re losing air . ”
 A section of the Zodiac ’ s sponson — the inflatable fender that wrap around the boat — had punctured . One side wa completely deflated . “ It ’ s a big deal , ” McCormack recently explained to me , sounding surprised that I had to ask . The sponson increase the boat ’ s buoyancy and stability , a well a keeping water from cresting over the side ; under normal condition , a Zodiac with a broken sponson would have been taken out of service automatically . Instead , McCormack found the puncture and wedged the nozzle of a small pump inside . Then — steering the boat with one hand , operating the throttle with the other — he started working the pump with his foot , essentially doing leg press , to keep the fender partly inflated . The ride wa already bumpy in four-foot sea . Now McCormack began tracing a slow , zigzagging course , doing what he could to tamp down the turbulence and the violence to Jon ’ s spine , a well a to guard against the possibility of the injured man ’ s suddenly bounding over the side on his backboard .
 Roberts and the other Coast Guardsmen on the Zodiac leaned over Jon to shield him from the splash . The pain wa heinous ; Jon seemed to be passing out . Roberts talked to him , held his hand . Roberts felt crushed , he told me ; he wa torturing this guy in order to save him . When they finally reached the Mustang , rather than hoist Jon off the Zodiac , they swung the ship ’ s crane around and simply lifted the entire boat out of the water , level with the deck , and then carried him aboard , to keep from joggling him any more .
 McCormack eventually returned for me and Dave , and a half-hour later we were reunited with Jon in the Mustang ’ s athwartship passageway , a cramped , steel hallway , like the space between two car of a train . Jon wa still battened to the backboard , wedged up to keep the weight of his body on his less-painful side . They had cut off his clothes , though he ’ d murmured a plea not to — he wa wearing a brand-new Patagonia jacket that he had borrowed from a friend — then swaddled him in a hypothermia blanket . Dave and I knelt and rubbed his foot .
 The helicopter wa going to make it . I don ’ t remember there being a grand announcement . I ’ m not sure we were ever made aware of the possibility that it wouldn ’ t . Now the crew got busy below : tying down anything that could be blown off by the rotor wash or stashing it in the mess . I also don ’ t remember hearing the helicopter when it finally arrived . Instead , I remember only a heavy door to our left swinging open to reveal , like a scene from an action movie , the silhouette of a man in a blue flight suit , foot planted shoulder-width apart to steady himself a the ship rocked sideways . The cable he ’ d been lowered on drew back into the ocean spray and fog behind him . “ I ’ m flight surgeon Russ Bowman , ” he said and stepped inside .
 Bowman took Jon ’ s vitals and gave him several , successive shot of morphine . Soon , everyone wa working to squeeze him back through the narrow doorway and onto the deck where the helicopter , an MH-60 Jayhawk , wa idling overhead .
 Until recently , the story I told about the accident unfolded in two basic act : the tree fell , instantaneously unleashing a kind of unfathomable chaos ; then the Coast Guard appeared and , just a swiftly , regathered that chaos into order . It wa like watching footage of an exploding object , then watching it run in reverse . The maneuver the Coast Guard wa readying to execute now , on the deck of the Mustang , would be the climax of that progression .
 The helicopter hovered 30 or 40 foot over the boat , mirroring it speed and trajectory , while both vehicle moved slowly forward . “ Looks like you ’ re heading for a rain squall , ” the co-pilot , Chris Ferguson , radioed the Mustang at one point , and asked the ship to adjust it course , to keep them in a forgiving weather a possible . Soon the flight mechanic wa calling out instruction to tuck the aircraft into alignment : “ Forward and right 30 . Forward and right 20 . Forward and right 10. ” Then , finally — speaking , in the flight recording , with an almost galling air of imperturbability — the lead helicopter pilot , Rich McIntyre , radioed the flight mechanic to begin the hoist .
 The whole procedure , from our vantage point , seemed seamless and routine . In a way , it wa : After the agonized deliberation at the air station , the pilot exited off their GPS route into fairly manageable condition around Inian Pass . The wind were workable ; the water wasn ’ t excessively choppy . Ultimately , scooping Jon off the deck of the Mustang would resemble a standard exercise that the pilot drilled in their training . “ Not to dumb it down , ” the co-pilot , Chris Ferguson , told me — plucking someone with a spinal injury off a moving boat and hoisting them into a moving helicopter is a pretty insane thing to do . “ But we normalize what isn ’ t normal . ”
 A few moment earlier , a the men scurried around Jon on his backboard , packaging and fastening him for the hoist , Jon worried that the second he got airborne he would start twirling uncontrollably , like the feathery end of a cat toy , and potentially thwack his head on the equipment on deck . But now , he wa levitating smoothly — a solitary , swaddled bale of a man , perfectly perpendicular to the ground . Dave and I watched it happen : our friend rising steadily away from u , improbably , to safety . As Jon floated higher , he could hear the Coast Guardsmen on the Mustang beneath him begin to cheer . He felt it wa safe to open his eye . When he did , he saw someone , hunched in the open cargo door of the helicopter , pointing a television camera at him .
 Jon wa rushed into surgery at the hospital in Sitka that evening . He ’ d punctured both lung , one to the point of collapse , sustained multiple fracture on eight of his rib , broken several vertebra , shattered his left shoulder blade and snapped his brachial plexus nerve . His spleen had been macerated into countless fleck . After awakening from surgery , Jon wa disappointed that the doctor had swept those shard into a bag and thrown his spleen in the trash ; he wanted to get a look at it , maybe even keep it preserved in a jar , alongside his cyborg-banana .
 Once back in Gustavus , Dave and I realized that we would need to call Jon ’ s parent in Switzerland . I didn ’ t have to push the job on Dave this time ; he wa adamant . He felt he would need to face conversation like these if he wa going to be a doctor . It wa Jon ’ s father who picked up , and after absorbing the news , he paused and caught Dave off guard . “ Thank you , ” he said solemnly . “ You guy saved my son ’ s life . ”
 Dave ’ s stomach dropped . “ I remember thinking about it , ” he told me recently , “ and realizing , Yeah . I guess , logistically , we did. ” I had the same reaction when Dave hung up the phone and , clearly shaken , relayed his conversation to me . Until that moment , the idea that we saved Jon ’ s life had never occurred to u , possibly because the idea that Jon might have died still hadn ’ t occurred to u . We had zero sense of accomplishment , or even agency . In our mind , all we did wa avoid screwing up until the real help could arrive and save him .
 But Jon hadn ’ t absorbed the story that way . From the instant he willed himself out of the water , he felt all of u locking into that same seamless flow of order steadily displacing chaos that Dave and I only experienced once the Coast Guard arrived . It wa amazing to him how the three of u managed to generate solution for each successive problem . Even my reciting those poem , which to me had always felt like a moment of utter helplessness , became , in Jon ’ s telling , a perfect emblem of that streak of serendipitous problem-solving . “ You conveyed a calmness , ” he told me recently . “ I remember it being this nice moment. ” He added that if he ever ha to spend two hour dying on a remote forest floor again , having me there to recite poetry would be one of his top way to do it .
 The feeling of inevitability that day became only more pronounced for Jon a time passed and the entire story of our rescue receded into a prologue to the rest of his life . The surgery in Sitka wa only the first of half a dozen , and it would take several year for him to regain 60 percent of the use of his arm , wrist and hand , a the nerve gradually regrew along his injured side . He wa in good enough shape to go back to Alaska the summer after the accident — repairing boat in the company ’ s warehouse and occasionally helping out at the bed-and-breakfast — but he struggled . He could repair kayak but needed help lifting them . He wa unable to wrestle the mattress corner into the fitted sheet when he made the bed . After that , he started working at a recording studio in Portland , just a he envisioned while stuck in the water , and he now run his own audio-mastering company : Spleenless Mastering .
 Eventually Jon seemed to have recovered from the accident without any conspicuous disability . But his life ha been quietly corroded by chronic pain and , almost equally , by the stress of navigating the doctor , medication ( and their side effect ) to manage it . About two year after the accident , he learned he had PTSD . The trauma wasn ’ t the falling tree , but his experience of powerlessness a a perpetual patient in the American medical system . It manifested a a kind of unbearable empathy for anyone who wa suffering . Jon found himself shouting at doctor , on his own behalf but also on behalf of stranger in waiting room who weren ’ t being seen . He would hear interview with natural-disaster victim or the homeless on NPR and have to pull his car over . There continued to be other tribulation , too — more mundane one . A few time a year , he still rebreaks a rib out of nowhere ; once or twice , Jon told me , all it ha taken is an especially affectionate hug from his wife .
 Jon found early on that he could cordon off this suffering , both in his own mind and in conversation , by making joke about the accident itself and sticking to the happy ending of our rescue , a trick that got much easier after the National Geographic show aired later that year . “ Mission Rescue : Final Frontier , ” the program wa called . The soundtrack wa all heart-thwacking synth drum and shredding guitar . A foreboding , Ken Burns-effected snapshot of Dave and Jon looking joyful before the trip gave way to a whirring re-enactment of someone else ’ s leg — cast in the role of Dave ’ s leg — sprinting through the blurry wood for our radio . A melodramatic narrator pondered the fate of “ Kayaker Jon Cohrs . ”
 Initially , the schlockiness of the production felt like a blessing . The show depersonalized the accident , giving u all a shorthand to convey how dramatic that day had been , without confronting how destabilizing and senseless it might have felt . At a party , you could lay out the basic — a tree fell on Jon — then say , “ National Geographic even made a TV special about it , ” and everyone would go wide-eyed but then move on , figuring you would unspool the real story some other time .
 But we never realized the degree to which that kitschy shorthand started to obscure the real story — then , gradually , to replace it . I ’ m embarrassed to admit that , though Jon and I have remained close , I did not know the extent to which he ha continued to suffer for the last 17 year until talking to him for several hour in order to write this account .
 The morning after the accident , Dave and I traveled back to Dundas Bay to pack up our campsite and collect the kayak we abandoned the previous evening . We were shuttled there from Gustavus by the same boat captain who dropped u off three day earlier , a forbiddingly taciturn commercial fisherman named Doug Ogilvy .
 The tide in the cove wa way out when we arrived ; it wa , a Ogilvy put it , “ a suck-ass beach. ” The approach wa so shallow that he had to drop anchor a hundred yard or more from shore . He asked if we had wader . We did not . So Ogilvy put on his , climbed down the ladder and told Dave to get on his back . Then stoically , like an ox or an old-timey strongman hauling a safe , he trudged through the thigh-high water , dropped Dave on the gravel beach , then lurched back and hauled me the same way , a if I were a man-size infant in a papoose .
 Dave told me he ’ d had a strange feeling on the ride out , a if we would discover that an even more massive tree had fallen on our tent since we last slept there and that all three of u would have been crushed and killed if we ’ d spent another night in Dundas Bay , a planned . That is , he half-expected to find evidence that the accident had been fortuitous somehow , that there wa a reason , or redemptive value , behind it . My mother had the same instinct when I called her the night before . On the phone I strained to emphasize for her — she wa only two year into her cruelly premature widowhood , and I wa new at being the overprotective son of a widow — that Jon wa going to be all right , and that Dave and I were safe . She told me that my dad must have been up there looking out for u somehow .
 I resented all the supernatural thinking . If it comforted other people , fine , but I ’ d somehow known right away that I didn ’ t need a reason for the accident . It wa senseless , but straightforward , a unequivocal a fact a my father ’ s death had been . A tree fell in the wood . It might not have , but it did . Jon could have died , but he didn ’ t . Other possibility spiraled infinitely outward from there , though apparently I wasn ’ t too interested in contemplating them . As strange a it sound , it wa year before I realized that the tree could have hit me — and only after a friend pointed this out , a I told the story around a fire one night . And it wa only a few week ago , while on the phone with Jon , that it occurred to me that the tree could have hit all three of u — we were standing in a single-file line , after all , waiting to cross the creek — and that we all might have wound up clobbered and scattered in that river , dying slowly and watching each other die .
 It ’ s also probably true that I helped preclude these possibility by being so feverishly paranoid about bear , wheeling around at the sound of the snapping root . That ’ s what allowed me to see the tree coming , just barely , and scream that infinitesimal heads-up for Dave . And so , the real meaning of the accident , if I felt compelled to find one , might be that it validated my most exaggerated fear . But instead , it somehow helped cleanse me of them . There wa comfort for me in accepting the arbitrariness of what happened , in regarding it a a spasm of random damage in time and space that , just a randomly , a small number of human being got the opportunity to repair . We were more capable than I had understood . We were also far more helpless .
 On the ride back to Gustavus with our gear , I pictured myself , again , a a small blip in empty space . The ride wa rough and jumpy a Ogilvy impatiently pounded his boat through the last vestigial wave energy of the storm ; Dave and I had to hold on , to plant ourselves on the bench behind him . But there wa a moment when I felt so safe that I loosened my grip , leaned slightly into the motion of the boat , and , closing my eye , felt myself lift off the seat .

 Rick Steves can tell you how to avoid having your pocket picked on the subway in Istanbul . He can tell you where to buy cooky from cloistered Spanish nun on a hilltop in Andalusia . He can tell you approximately what percentage of Russia ’ s gross domestic product come from bribery . He can teach you the magic idiom that unlocks perfectly complementary gelato flavor in Florence ( “ What marries well ? ” ) .
 But Rick Steves doe not know his way around New York City .
 “ In the Western Hemisphere , ” Steves told me one afternoon last March , “ I am a terrible traveler . ”
 We were , at that moment , very much inside the Western Hemisphere , 4,000 mile west of Rome , inching through Manhattan in a hired black car . Steves wa in the middle of a grueling speaking tour of the United States : 21 city in 34 day . New York wa stop No.17 . He had just flown in from Pittsburgh , where he had spent le than 24 hour , and he would soon be off to Los Angeles , Denver and Dallas . In his brief window of down time , Steves did not go out searching for quaint restaurant or architectural treasure . He sat alone in his hotel room , clacking away on his laptop , working on new project . His whole world , for the time being , had been reduced to a concrete blur of airport , hotel , lecture hall and medium appearance .
 In this town car , however , rolling through Midtown , Steves wa brimming with delight . He wa between a TV interview at the New York Stock Exchange and a podcast at CBS , and he seemed a enchanted by all the big-city bustle a the most wide-eyed tourist .
 “ Look at all the building ! ” he exclaimed . “ There ’ s so much energy ! Man , oh , man ! ”
 A woman crossed the street pushing two Yorkies in a stroller .


 “ How cute ! ” Steves shouted .
 The town car crawled toward a shabby metal hulk spanning the East River .
 “ Wow ! ” Steves said . “ Is that the Brooklyn Bridge ? ”
 It wa almost the opposite of the Brooklyn Bridge . The Brooklyn Bridge is one of the most recognizable structure in the world : a stretched stone cathedral . This wa it unloved upriver cousin , a tangle of discolored metal , vibrating with car , perpetually under construction . The driver told Steves that it wa the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge — or , a most New Yorkers still thought of it , the 59th Street Bridge .
 This revelation only increased Steves ’ s wonder .
 “ The 59th Street Bridge ! ” he said . “ That ’ s one of my favorite song ! ”
 With buoyant enthusiasm , Steves started to sing Simon and Garfunkel ’ s classic 1966 tune “ The 59th Street Bridge Song ( Feelin ’ Groovy ) . ”
 “ Slow down , you move too fast , ” he sang . “ You got to make the mornin ’ last — just — kickin ’ down the cobblestone . ... ”
 The car hit traffic and lurched to a stop . Steves paused to scan the street outside . “ Where are the cobblestone ? ” he asked . Then he refocused . He finished the song with a flourish : “ Lookin ’ for fun and feelin ’ — GROOOVYYYYYY ! ”
 There wa a silence in the car .
 “ Can you imagine those two guy walking around right here ? ” Steves said . “ Just feeling groovy ? Gosh , that ’ s cool . ”
 Steves pulled out his phone and , for his online fan , recorded a video of himself singing “ The 59th Street Bridge Song ( Feelin ’ Groovy ) . ”
 “ It ’ s fun to be in New York City , ” he signed off . “ Happy travel ! ”
 There wa another silence in the car , this one longer .
 “ You know , ” the driver said finally , “ you ’ re not very different than you are on your show . ”
 This wa correct . The driver wa referring to Steves ’ s long-running , widely syndicated , family-friendly public-television travel series , “ Rick Steves ’ Europe , ” on which Steves is a joyful and jaunty host , all eager-beaver smile and expressive head tilt . With a backpack over one shoulder and a hand tucked into his pocket , Steves gush poetically about England ’ s Lake District ( “ a lush land steeped in a rich brew of history , culture and nature ” ) and Erfurt , Germany ( “ this half-timbered medieval town with a shallow river gurgling through it center ” ) and Istanbul ( “ this sprawling metropolis on the Bosporus ” ) and Lisbon ( “ like San Francisco , but older and grittier and le expensive ” ) . He reclines jauntily atop the cliff of Dover and is vigorously scrubbed in a Turkish bath . The show ha aired now for nearly 20 year , and in that time , among traveler , Steves ha established himself a one of the legendary PBS superdorks — right there in the pantheon with Mr. Rogers , Bob Ross and Big Bird . Like them , Steves is a gentle soul who want to help you feel at home in the world . Like them , he seems miraculously untouched by the need to look cool , which of course make him sneakily cool . To the aspiring traveler , Steves is a inspirational a Julia Child once wa to the aspiring home chef .

 Eventually , Steves ’ s busy New York day ended on the Upper East Side , where he wa scheduled to give a talk at a Barnes & Noble . As we drove to the event , Steves confessed that he wasn ’ t sure what kind of crowd he would get . You never knew exactly where his Rickniks ( a the hard-core fan call themselves ) would materialize en masse . Some Steves appearance were mobbed ; others were sparse . His appeal is slightly cultish . For every Ricknik out in the world , a large contingent of average people have no idea who he is .
 I wa mildly skeptical about Steves ’ s drawing power in New York . It wa hard to imagine a bunch of cynical , worldly , urban , polyglot , multicultural East Coast sophisticate — people who probably vacationed at deconsecrated eco-hostels in Oman or Madagascar — getting excited about public television ’ s reigning expert on Europe .
 We arrived , however , to find the bookstore overflowing . A solid wave of applause met Steves at the door . Fans had been pouring in , the organizer told u , for two solid hour . People sat in the aisle and stood in the back . Some wore T-shirts and hat bearing the Rick Steves slogan : “ Keep on Travelin ’ . ” The crowd ’ s body heat overwhelmed the building ’ s climate control .
 I noticed a group of hipster 20-somethings standing near the back , and at first I assumed they had all come sarcastically . But a Steves began to speak , they grinned and laughed with absolute earnestness . Everyone here wa , apparently , a superfan . At one point , Steves showed a slide of tourist swimming in a sunny French river underneath a Roman aqueduct , and the whole crowd gasped . When he mentioned that his website featured a special video devoted to packing light for woman , a woman in the crowd actually pumped her fist .
 At the end of his talk , Steves offered to sign book — but not in the traditional way . There were too many people for a signing table , he said , and anyway , single-file line were always inefficient . ( This is one of his travel credo : avoid waiting in line . ) Instead of sitting down , Steves walked out into the center of the room and invited everyone to open their book and surround him . He pulled out a Sharpie . And then he started to spin . Steves held out his pen and signed book after book after book , fluidly , on the move , smiling a the crowd pressed in . “ We went to Portugal on our honeymoon , ” a man shouted . “ How romantic ! ” Steves answered , still spinning . A woman asked him where to celebrate Christmas in Europe . Steves , in midrotation , still signing furiously , told her that he had made a whole special about precisely that question and that it wa available free on his website . “ Keep on travelin ’ , Rick ! ” someone shouted . “ Keep on travelin ’ ! ” Steves shouted back . As he spun , Steves thanked everyone and gave quick , off-the-cuff advice . In an astonishingly short time , he had signed every book . The people were satisfied . The crowd thinned . Steves finally came to a stop .
 Rick Steves is absolutely American . He wear jean every single day . He drink frozen orange juice from a can . He like his hash brown burned , his coffee extra hot . He dislike most fancy restaurant ; when he ’ s on the road , he prefers to buy a foot-long Subway sandwich and split it between lunch and dinner . He ha a great spontaneous honk of a laugh — it burst out of him , when he is truly delighted , with the sharpness of a firecracker on the Fourth of July . Steves is so completely American that when you stop to really look at his name , you realize it ’ s just the name Rick followed by the plural of Steve — that he is a one-man crowd of absolutely regular everyday American guy : one Rick , many Steves . Although Steves spends nearly half his life traveling , he insists , passionately , that he would never live anywhere but the United States — and you know when he say it that this is absolutely true . In fact , Steves still life in the small Seattle suburb where he grew up , and every morning he walk to work on the same block , downtown , where his parent owned a piano store 50 year ago . On Sundays , Steves wear his jean to church , where he play the conga , with great arm-pumping spirit , in the inspirational soft-rock band that serenade the congregation before the service start , and then he sits down and sings classic Lutheran hymn without even needing to refer to the hymnal . Although Steves ha published many foreign-language phrase book , the only language he speaks fluently is English . He built his business in America , raised his kid in America and give frequent loving paean to the glory of American life .
 And yet : Rick Steves desperately want you to leave America . The tiniest exposure to the outside world , he belief , will change your entire life . Travel , Steves like to say , “ wallop your ethnocentricity ” and “ carbonate your experience ” and “ rearranges your cultural furniture. ” Like sealed window on a hot day , a nation ’ s border can be stultifying . Steves want to crack them open , to let humanity ’ s breeze circulate . The more rootedly American you are , the more Rick Steves want this for you . If you have never had a passport , if you are afraid of the world , if your family would prefer to vacation exclusively at Walt Disney World , if you worry that foreigner are rude and predatory and prone to violence or at least that their food will give you diarrhea , then Steves want you — especially you — to go to Europe . Then he want you to go beyond . ( For a majority of his audience , Steves say , “ Europe is the wading pool for world exploration. ” ) Perhaps , like him , you will need large headphone and half a tab of Ambien to properly relax on the flight , but Steves want you to know that it will be worth it . He want you to stand and make little moaning sound on a cobblestone street the first time you taste authentic Italian gelato — flavor so pure they seem like the primordial essence of peach or melon or pistachio or rice distilled into molecule and stirred directly into your own molecule . He want you to hike on a dirt path along a cliff over the almost-too-blue Mediterranean , with village and vineyard spilling down the rugged mountain above you . He want you to arrive at the Parthenon at dusk , just before it close , when all the tour group are loading back onto their cruise ship , so that you have the whole place to yourself and can stand there feeling like a private witness to the birth , and then the ruination , of Western civilization .
 Steves want you to go to Europe for a long a you can afford to , and he also want to help you afford it . ( Much of his guru energy is focused on cutting cost . ) He want you to go a many time a possible , and while you ’ re there , he want you to get way down deep into the culture , to eat with local in the teeming market , to make a sympathetic fool of yourself , to get entirely lost in your lack of America .
 Out of this paradoxical desire — the enlightenment of Americans through their extraction from America — Steves ha built his quirky travel empire . His guidebook , which started a hand-typed and photocopied information packet for his scraggly 1970s tour group , now dominate the American market ; their distinctive blue-and-yellow spine brighten the travel section of bookstore everywhere . Steves is le interested in reaching sophisticated traveler than he is in converting the uninitiated . ( “ There will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents , ” the Bible tell u , “ than over 99 righteous person who do not need to repent. ” ) Last year , his company led close to 30,000 paying customer on dozen of elaborate European itinerary . Steves teach his follower everything from how to pack a toiletry kit to how to make themselves at home in a small hotel room to how to appreciate a religious tradition they may have been raised to despise . ( In order to enjoy St. Peter ’ s Basilica , Steves admits , he had to learn to “ park my Protestant sword at the door. ” ) He is a sort of spiritual travel agent for America ’ s curious but hesitant middle class . He is simultaneously goofy and dead serious ; he can ping , in an instant , from golly-gee Pollyanna cheerfulness to deep critique of the modern world . In a series of long , affectionate , candid conversation , Steves ’ s colleague described him to me using the word “ sophomoric , ” “ knucklehead ” and “ Santa Claus ” — but also “ juggernaut , ” “ evangelical ” and “ revolutionary. ” Rick Steves want u to travel because it ’ s fun , yes , but also because he belief it might actually save the world .
 I can testify , firsthand , to the power of Rick Steves . In 1998 , he spoke at my college . Nothing about the encounter seemed promising . Our campus wa a tiny outpost in a tiny town , and Steves delivered his talk not in some grand lecture hall but in a drab room in the basement of the student union . I wa poor , shy , anxious , sheltered , repressed and extremely pale . I wa a particular kind of Pacific Northwest white guy — blind to myself and my place in the world . I had never really traveled ; I wa more comfortable on Greyhound bus than on airplane . Going to Europe seemed like something aristocrat did , like fox hunting or debutante ball .
 My girlfriend dragged me to the talk . I had never even heard of Steves . He entered looking like the kind of guy who would bring an acoustic guitar to every single church picnic within a two-hour radius of his favorite Applebee ’ s : large glass , floppy hair , bluejeans , wholesome grin . But what he said over the next hour or so changed the rest of my life .
 It ’ s hard to describe how thoroughly energized Steves becomes in front of a crowd . He pace , gesticulates and speaks very fast . He tell his favorite old joke a if they were eternally new . ( “ Eet smell like zee foot of angel , ” the French cheesemonger always exclaims . ) Onstage , he is a combination of preacher , comedian , salesman , life-hacker , professor and inspirational speaker . Steves told u , that day , how to pack our entire life into a single bag measuring 9 by 22 by 14 inch . ( “ It ’ s enlightened to pack light , ” Steves insists . “ It ’ s a blessing to pack light. ” ) He told u how to find excellent cheap hotel , how to survive on minimalist picnic in public park , how to wash clothing in bathroom sink and how to make friend without sharing a language . Steves ’ s signature book , “ Europe Through the Back Door , ” seemed le like a travel philosophy than a whole mode of being : scrappy , prepared , independent , extroverted . Europe ’ s front door , he told u , wa positioned to feed traveler directly into exploitation : overpriced cafe , trinket shop , long line , corporate high-rise hotel . The back door , by contrast , led to revelation . He showed u impossibly enticing photo : cobblestone piazza teeming with fruit stall , quirky wooden hotel among wildflower in the Alps , vast arsenal of multicolored cheese . He made travel seem le like a luxury than a necessary exploration of the self , a civic responsibility , a basic courtesy to your fellow human . It seemed almost unreasonable not to go . Above all , Steves told u , do not be afraid . The people of the world are wonderful , and the planet we share is spectacular . But the only way to really understand that is to go and see it for yourself . So go .
 My girlfriend and I left the room convert to the gospel of Rick Steves . We bought his book and highlighted it to near-meaninglessness . We started mapping itinerary , squirreling away money , asking relative for donation . ( In probably the worst phone call of my life , my rancher grandfather expressed shock and dismay that I would ask him to support this meaningless overseas lark . ) Eventually , over many month , we scraped together just enough to buy plane ticket and order minimalist Steves-approved supply , including a travel towel so thin and nonabsorbent that it seemed to just push the moisture around your skin until you forgot you were wet . We packed exactly a Steves taught u : T-shirts rolled into space-saving noodle , just enough clothes to get u from one hotel laundry session to the next . Then , for the first time in our life , we left North America .
 One of Steves ’ s strongest recommendation is to keep a journal . Mine wa so corny that it cover actually said “ A TRAVELER ’ S NOTEBOOK ” over a picture of the Eiffel Tower . When I opened it recently , the reality of that long-ago trip hissed out with fresh urgency . My 20-year-old self recorded everything . On our first day in Europe , we bought imported Austrian apple with fat , heavy English coin and saw a woman stumble on a staircase , breaking an entire bag of newly bought china . We arrived at our first hostel , the Y.M.C.A . in Bath , to find a man urinating in the stairwell — so we kept walking until we happened into a nearby churchyard , where the gravestone were so old and thin they were almost translucent . As we tried to make out the name of the dead , songbird sang strenuously in the tree all around u . This juxtaposition — old death , new life — blew my jet-lagged American mind . “ Already , after just one day in Bath , ” I wrote in my journal , “ the world ha grown firmer . Reality fill it gap . ”
 That , more or le , wa the theme of the trip . For six week , we followed the Steves game plan . We shared squalid bunk with other young traveler from Denmark , Australia , Canada and Japan . In the stately public park of Paris , we ate rotisserie chicken with our bare hand . One stifling afternoon at the Colosseum in Rome , we watched a worker slam his ladder against the edge of an arch and break off some ancient brick . ( He looked over at u , looked down at the brick , kicked dirt over them and kept working . ) We were moved by Van Gogh , Picasso and Gaudí , but unmoved by Versailles ( “ more vain than beautiful , ” I wrote ) , bullfighting ( “ more brutal than artful ” ) and Goya ( “ vague and blurry ” ) . Once , I left my underwear on a Mediterranean beach overnight and , since I could not afford to lose a pair , had to go back and pick it up the next day , in full view of all the sunbather .
 Wherever we went , Rick Steves wa with u . In my journal , I referred to him half-jokingly a our “ worldly uncle and guiding light , ” and a we walked around , I annoyed my girlfriend by doing impression of him . We seemed to have entered the world of his slide : the fruit market and overnight train , the sunny French river under the ancient Roman aqueduct . Sometimes our European host , with the quiet pride of someone who once met Elvis , told u story about Steves . He wa a gentleman , they said , a truly good man , and he always came in person to check out their hotel , and he never failed to ask them how their child were doing .
 By the end of our trip , we were completely broke . We couldn ’ t afford even a baguette on our last day in Paris . We flew home looking ragged , shaggy , weather-beaten and exhausted .


 But of course Steves wa right : Our life were never the same . We were still young Americans , but we felt liberated and empowered , like true citizen of the world . The most important thing we learned all had to do with home . As the English writer G.K. Chesterton once put it , in a quote I found printed in my corny old travel journal : “ The whole object of travel is not to set foot on foreign land ; it is at last to set foot on one ’ s own country a a foreign land. ” After looking at a Roman stone wall topped by a Saxon stone wall topped by a medieval English wall next to a modern paved street , I began to see what a thin crust of national history the United States actually stand on . I began to realize how silly and narrow our notion of exceptionalism is — this impulse to consider ourselves somehow immune to the force that shape the rest of the world . The environment I grew up in , with it mall and freeway , it fantasy of heroic individualism , began to seem unnatural . I started to sense how much reality exists elsewhere in the world — not just in a theoretical sense , in book and movie , but with the full urgent weight of the real . And not just in Europe but on every other continent , all the time , forever . I began to realize how much I still had to learn before I could pretend to understand anything . Not everyone need Steves ’ s help to get to this point . Some people get there themselves , or their community help them . But I needed him , and I am eternally glad I wa dragged that day to see him talk .
 [ How to eat in Venice like a Venetian . ]
 Steves answered his front door slightly distracted . I had come in the middle of his breakfast preparation . He wa stirring a block of frozen orange juice into a pitcher of water . “ Freshly squeezed from the can ! ” he quipped . This wa April 2018 , exactly 20 year after my first trip to Europe . I had come to see Steves in the most exotic place possible : his home . He life just north of Seattle , in a town so rainy it ha a free umbrella-share program . There is nothing particularly exotic about the house itself . It ha beige carpeting , professionally trimmed shrub and a back deck with a hot tub . What wa exotic wa simply that Steves wa there . He had just returned from his frenetic speaking tour of the United States and would be leaving almost immediately on his annual trip to Europe . For now , he wa making breakfast : frozen blueberry , Kashi cereal , O.J . “ I would eat this every day for the rest of my life if I could , ” he said .
 But of course , he could not . Steves is gone too much , yo-yoing between the misty forest of the Pacific Northwest and the sun-baked cathedral of Europe . Every year , no matter what else is going on , Steves spends at least four month practicing the kind of travel he ha preached for 40-odd year : hauling his backpack up narrow staircase in cheap hotel , washing his clothes in sink , improvising picnic .
 He is now 63 , and he could afford to retire many time over . But he doesn ’ t have the metabolism for sitting around . Among his colleague , Steves is a notorious workaholic . After grueling day of filming in Europe , he ha been known to slip script revision under the crew ’ s door at 2 a.m. , and then to ask them , at breakfast , for their feedback . On long car ride , he sits in the back seat and type op-eds on his laptop . His relentless hands-on control of every aspect of his business is what ha distinguished the Rick Steves brand .
 It is also , obviously , exhausting — if not for Steves , then at least for the people around him . He ha two child , now grown , and for much of their childhood , Steves wa gone . He wa building his company , changing the world . For very long stretch , his wife wa forced to be a single mother . ( She and Steves divorced in 2010 after 25 year of marriage . ) Every summer , when the family joined Steves in Europe , his pace hardly slackened : They would cover major city in 48 hour , blitzing through huge museum back to back . The kid complained so much , on one trip , that Steves finally snapped — if they were so miserable , he said , they could just go sit in the hotel room all day and play video game . They remember this day a heaven . One year , while Steves wa away , the child converted to Catholicism . His son , Andy Steves , eventually went into the family business : He now work a a tour guide and even published a European guidebook .
 Steves is fully aware that his obsessive work ethic is unusual . He admits that he ha regret . But he can not make himself stop . He ha the fervor of the true evangelist : The more people he meet , the more city he visit , the more life he might change . At one point , a we talked , he pulled out the itinerary for his coming trip — from Sicily to Iceland , with no down time whatsoever . Just looking at it made him giddy . I asked why he couldn ’ t ease up slightly — maybe just spend two month in Europe , maybe just speak in 10 American city .
 “ It ’ s a strange thing , ” he said . “ I get energy from it . It ’ s like I ’ m breathing straight oxygen . What would I do if I stayed home ? Not much . Nothing I would remember . ”
 In his house , Steves offered up a little show and tell . He pointed out an antique silver cigarette lighter shaped like the Space Needle . He sat down at his baby grand piano and lost himself , for a few happy minute , playing Scarlatti . He took me to a room filled with book and reached up to a very high shelf . “ I don ’ t show this to too many people , ” he said , “ because they ’ ll think I ’ m nuts. ” Steves pulled down a thick red binder , the content of which were , indeed , pretty nutty . When Steves wa 13 , he decided , for no apparent reason , to conduct a deep statistical analysis of the 1968 Billboard pop chart . Every week , he would clip the ranking out of his local newspaper and , using a point system of his own devising , graph the top band ’ success on sheet of gridded paper . The line were multicolored and interwoven — it looked like the subway map of some fantastical foreign city . You could see , at a glance , the rising and falling fortune of the Beatles ( red ) and Creedence Clearwater Revival ( black ) and Elvis Presley ( dot and dash ) . Steves kept this up for three year , taping together many piece of graph paper , and in the end he summarized the data in an authoritative-looking table that he typed on the family typewriter . This is what wa in that binder : a systematic breakdown of the most successful band from 1968 to 1970 , a determined by the objective statistic of an analytical adolescent weirdo . ( The winner , of course , were the Beatles — 1,739 point — followed by Creedence , Simon and Garfunkel , Neil Diamond . )
 Steves laughed . It wa ridiculous . But it wa also a perfect window into his mind . Even at 13 , a powerful energy wa coiled inside him — an unusual combination of obsession and precision , just waiting for some worthwhile project to burst out in .
 And that , coincidentally , wa exactly when he found it : the project of his life . In the summer of 1969 , when Steves wa 14 , his parent took him to Europe . They owned a business tuning and importing piano , and they wanted to see factory firsthand . Steves approached this first trip abroad with the same meticulous energy he brought to his Billboard graph . As he traveled around the continent , he recorded the essential data of his journey on the back of postcard : location , activity , weather , expense . One day , Steves spent 40 cent on fishing gear . Another , he met a 79-year-old man who had witnessed the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand . To keep everything in order , Steves numbered the postcard sequentially . He still ha them all packed lovingly into an old wooden box .
 On that same formative trip , the Steves family visited relative in Norway . They happened to be there in July 1969 , when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon . “ Ett lite skritt for et menneske , ” the television said , “ ett stort sprang for menneskeheten. ” In that moment , in that strange place , young Rick Steves felt the concept of “ menneskeheten ” — “ mankind ” — at a depth he never would have been able to access back home . Europe wa a crash course in cultural relativity . In a park in Oslo , he had an epiphany : The foreign human around him , he realized , were leading existence every bit a rich and full a his own . “ Right there , ” he would write later , “ my 14-year-old egocentric worldview took a huge hit. ” A life-changing realization clicked into place . “ This planet must be home to billion of equally lovable child of God . ”
 That first trip set the course for everything that followed . When Steves wa 18 , he went back to Europe without his parent . Soon , life in America became a series of interlude between travel . He taught piano to earn money , then stretched that money a far a he possibly could , sleeping on church pew and park bench , in empty barn and construction zone , from Western Europe to Afghanistan . He turned his cheapness into a science . Instead of paying for a hotel room in a city , Steves would use his Railpass and sleep on a train for the night — four hour out , four hour back . He would stuff himself on free breakfast bread , then try to eat a little a possible for the rest of the day . Naturally , he recorded all this , and today he ha an impressive archive of old travel journal . Their page preserve , in tiny handwriting , shadowy young dissident in Moscow , diarrhea in Bulgaria , revolution in Nicaragua .
 In his 20 , Steves brought his wide-roaming wisdom back to the United States . He started to supplement his piano teaching with travel seminar . His signature class , European Travel Cheap , ran for six hour . Steves could have talked longer than that , but it struck him a impractical for his student . In Europe , he rented a nine-seat minibus and started to lead small tour . Eventually , his seminar and tour note morphed into his book . The first edition of “ Europe Through the Back Door , ” published in 1980 , wa typed on a rented IBM Selectric . It had no ISBN and looked so amateurish that bookstore assumed it wa an early review copy . “ Anyone caught reprinting any material herein for any purpose whatsoever will be thanked profusely , ” it said . This wa the birth of the Rick Steves empire .
 Rick Steves both is and is not his TV persona . Offscreen , he allows himself to be much more explicitly political . He ha the passion of the autodidact . Growing up , Steves led a relatively sheltered existence : He wa a white , comfortable , middle-class baby boomer in a white , comfortable , middle-class pocket of America . Travel did for him what he promise it will do for everyone else : It put him in contact with other reality . He saw desperate poverty in Iran and became obsessed with economic injustice . He started searching for answer in book , scribbling note in the margin of “ Bread for the World , ” by Arthur Simon , and “ The Origins of Totalitarianism , ” by Hannah Arendt . He studied the war industry and colonial exploitation . The first time Steves traveled to Central America , he came back so outraged that he wrote a fiery tract called “ There ’ s Blood on Your Banana , ” then flew to Washington and hand-delivered a copy to the office of every member of Congress .
 In the early day , Steves injected political lesson into his European tour . Sometimes he would arrive in a city with no hotel reservation , just to make his privileged customer feel the anxiety of homelessness . In Munich , he would set up camp in an infamous hippie circus tent , among all the countercultural wanderer of Europe .
 Today , Steves is more strategic . His most powerful tool , he realizes , is his broad appeal . He ha an uncanny knack for making serious criticism feel gentle and friendly . Often he disguise critique of America with a rhetorical move that I like to think of a “ U.S.A. ! U.S.A. ! U.S.A. ! ( But . ... ) ” “ I ’ m unapologetically proud to be an American , ” he writes in the introduction to his book “ Travel a a Political Act. ” “ The happiest day of any trip is the day I come home . ... But other nation have some pretty good idea too . ”
 That ’ s when he hit his audience with legal prostitution , high tax rate and universal health care .
 When I asked Steves about this strategy , he chuckled .
 “ It ’ s not America-bashing , ” he said . “ It ’ s America-loving . I think it ’ s loving America to look at it critically . But you ’ ve got to set it up . You ’ ve got to allay people ’ s concern that you ’ re a communist . So you explain to them : I ’ m a capitalist , I make a lot of money , I employ a lot of people , I love the law of supply and demand . It seems kind of silly , but you ’ ve got to say that . Then , especially the husband who are dragged there by their wife , they go , ‘ I thought he wa a commie , but he ’ s O.K. ’ And then you don ’ t need to be too gentle . You can confront people with a different perspective , and you ’ ll get through . ”
 Steves learned this strategy , he said , from his early day running tour , living with the same people for week at a time . Survival required being pleasant . People didn ’ t want grating lecture about America ’ s shortcoming — even if that wa sometimes his instinct . Instead , he pointed out different perspective with a smile . He became fluent in the need of American tourist . “ I know what their button are , ” he said . “ I know what their attention span is . I don ’ t want to just preach to the choir . I want to preach to organization that need to hear this , so I need to compromise a little bit so the gatekeeper let it through to their world . ”
 This balancing act ha become increasingly difficult over the past two decade , in a world of terrorism , war , nationalism and metastasizing partisanship . After the Sept. 11 attack , most travel company anticipated that the bottom wa about to fall out of the market . They canceled tour and cut back budget . Steves , however , remained defiantly optimistic . He promised his staff that there would be no cut , no layoff and no shift in message . He insisted that a world in crisis needed travel more , not le . Soon the shock of Sept. 11 turned into the Iraq war , which strained the relationship between the United States and even it closest European ally , sending the travel industry deeper into it trough . In his hometown , Steves caused a controversy when he walked around removing row of American flag that had been set up in support of the war . It wa , he argued , an act of patriotism : The flag is meant to represent all Americans , not just war supporter . “ I wa shark-bait on Seattle ’ s right-wing radio talk show for several day , ” he wrote .
 Lately , Steves concedes , his political message ha begun to take over his teaching . In “ Travel a a Political Act , ” the familiar element of his guidebook — walking tour , museum guide , hotel review — are replaced by rabble-rousing cultural critique . Steves express deep admiration for Scandinavian-style social democracy and call out many of America ’ s fault : our addiction to car and gun and mass incarceration ; our deference to corporation ; our long history of cultural imperialism ( “ one of the ugliest thing one nation can do is write another nation ’ s textbook ” ) . Some moment in the book verge on un-American . “ Sometimes , when I ’ m frustrated with the impact of American foreign policy on the developing world , ” Steves writes , “ I have this feeling that an impotent America is better for the world than an America whose power isn ’ t always used for good . ”
 Occasionally , despite his best effort , Steves still ruffle feather . Recent TV special have covered Iran — “ I believe if you ’ re going to bomb a place , ” Steves ha written , “ you should know it people first ” — and the rise of fascism in Europe . In a special about the Holy Land , Steves refers unapologetically to “ Palestine ” instead of “ the West Bank ” or “ Palestinian territory ” ; some viewer were so outraged that they told Steves they were removing PBS from their will . After one recent speech in the Deep South , event organizer refused to pay Steves — their conservative sponsor , he learned , considered his message a form of liberal propaganda .
 In recent year , Steves ha become a happy warrior for an unlikely cause : the legalization of marijuana . He first tried the drug in Afghanistan , in the 1970s , in the name of cultural immersion , and he wa fascinated by it effect on his mind . Today , he is a board member of Norml , the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws , and a regular speaker at Hempfest . In his headquarters you will find a poster of the Mona Lisa holding a gargantuan spliff . In 2012 , Steves campaigned hard for Washington State ’ s successful legalization initiative , and since then he ha barnstormed other state ( Oregon , Maine , Vermont and more ) to make sure the civil liberty are properly passed around . On a shelf in his living room , right there among all the European knickknack , Steves display a sizable bong .
 Sometimes , fan urge Steves to run for office . When I asked him if he would ever get into politics , he had an answer ready : “ I already am. ” Good travel teaching , in his eye , is inherently political . To stay in a family-owned hotel in Bulgaria is to strengthen global democracy ; to pack light is to break the iron logic of consumerism ; to ride a train across Europe is to challenge the fossil-fuel industry . Travel , to Steves , is not some frivolous luxury — it is an engine for improving humankind , for connecting people and removing their prejudice , for knocking distant culture together to make unlikely spark of joy and insight . Given that million of people have encountered the work of Steves over the last 40 year , on TV or online or in his guidebook , and that they have carried those lesson to untold other million of people , it is fair to say that his life ’ s work ha had a real effect on the collective life of our planet . When people tell Steves to stay out of politics , to stick to travel , he can only laugh .
 “ It ’ s flattering to think I could run for office , ” he admitted . “ And it would be exciting . But I think I ’ m accomplishing more right now than I would in office , and I ’ m having more fun . I ’ m skiing with beautiful wax on my ski . When I want to do something , I can do it . ”
 Steves is deeply indifferent to creature comfort . When I visited him , the back seat of his car wa covered with a greenish slime , practically disintegrating , because of a mysterious leak . He just cracked the window to try to dry it out . Steves prefers to spend his money on his favorite cause . His activism can be quirky and impulsive . In 2011 , after hearing that his local symphony orchestra wa struggling , he stepped in with a gift of $ 1 million , spread over 10 year , to help keep it operating . ( This , pointedly , wa how much money he would get back from President George W. Bush ’ s tax cut over a decade . ) Last year , during a chat with one of the national leader of the Lutheran Church , Steves wondered how much it would cost to send every single Lutheran congregation in the United States a DVD of his recent TV special about Martin Luther . It wa something like $ 30,000 ; Steves happily wrote the check . In the 1990s , working in partnership with the Y.W.C.A. , he started investing his retirement saving in local real estate in order to house homeless mother and their child . The plan wa to take that money out of the banking system and let it do a few decade of social good , at which point Steves could sell the building to fund his retirement . Eventually he worked his way up to buying a whole 24-unit apartment complex — and then he donated it outright to the Y.W.C.A . The mother , he said , needed it more than he would .
 Steves is obsessed with the problem of poverty and amazed at our perpetual misunderstanding of it . “ It ’ s not just : You screwed up , so you ’ re poor , ” he said . “ There ’ s a structure that keep half of humanity poor . This need to be talked about . I can do it , and I can get away with it. ” His next TV special , in production now , will investigate extreme poverty and hunger through two very different non-European country : Guatemala and Ethiopia . In the meantime , all the royalty of his latest book — an updated edition of “ Travel a a Political Act ” — are being donated to Bread for the World , an organization that lobby on behalf of hungry people . He is working on making his company ’ s tour completely carbon-neutral .
 “ If I wa trying to build a career on the speaking circuit — if I wa struggling , and I needed these gig — I would not talk about that stuff , ” he said . “ I could just talk about light stuff , and everybody would love it . But I ’ m not working right now to do that . I ’ m not trying to get anywhere that I ’ m not already . I don ’ t need to be anything I ’ m not . I ’ m 63 year old . I could retire now . But I ’ m ramping up . ”
 Indeed , Steves ’ s business ha been booming . Once the travel market finally recovered , some year after Sept. 11 , Steves occupied a disproportionately big share of it — precisely because he had refused to scale back . By taking a principled stand , Steves flourished . Today , his chipper voice is reaching more Americans than ever . “ Fear , ” a Steves like to say , “ is for people who don ’ t get out very much . ”
 [ 4 stop for a woman-focused trip to Seoul . ]
 One night , in his living room , Steves pulled out a plain black notebook . “ Here ’ s something you might find interesting , ” he said with his trademark cheer , and he flipped open to a random page and prepared to read aloud . I wa familiar , by then , with Steves ’ s deep archive of old travel journal , and so I settled in to listen to further adventure from 1975 Moscow or 1997 Paris . This , however , wa something else entirely — a record of a very different kind of journey .
 “ Getting high , ” Steves read , “ release the human in me . ”
 “ Intelligence is a rubber band , ” he continued . “ Getting high is stretching it . ”
 I wa sitting in the beige living room of America ’ s foremost travel guru , underneath framed reproduction of popular European masterworks , and my mind wa about to be well and truly blown . For the next 20 minute , Steves would read me koan about the glory of being stoned .
 “ High is the present , ” he read .
 “ When you ’ re high , you debate long and hard over whether to put on your sweater or turn up the heat . ”
 This journal , Steves explained , contained what he called his “ High Notes. ” For nearly 40 year , he had been writing in it exclusively after smoking marijuana . He would get baked , open up to somewhere in the middle and jot down whatever he happened to be thinking — deep or shallow , silly or angry . There is no chronology ; on every page , axiom from many different decade commingle . It is a lifelong treasury of Steves ’ s stoner thought .
 He continued to read .
 “ As soon a I stop mattering so much , I ’ ll be happier . ”
 “ A baby doesn ’ t know if the hanging is on the wall or if the wall is on the hanging . ”
 “ Make a rug with vacuum mark , so it always look freshly vacuumed . ”
 The entry covered an impressively wide territory . Some were little shred of oracular poetry ( “ We all have a divine harness ” ) , while others were dashed-off semi-witticisms ( “ Wolfgang von Bewildered ” ) or bitter social critique ( “ The spiritual cesspool of America — our shopping mall ” ) . “ They don ’ t let you into heaven without callus on your soul , ” he read at one point . “ Suffer or weep. ” There were scrap of humorous dialogue ( “ ‘ Nothing is wrong with an ego ! ’ he bellowed ” ) and sentence that would have made great bumper sticker on rusting VW bus : “ I ’ d like to be quarantined from reality . ”
 I found myself wondering , for the thousandth time : Who doe this ? What kind of mind not only think of such a project but actually follows through with it , decade after decade after decade ? Who , for God ’ s sake , is this disciplined when they ’ re high ?
 As Steves read , he interrupted himself again and again with great shouting honk of laughter , and I cackled right along with him . Then , suddenly , with almost no transition , we would find ourselves deep in earnest conversation about the nature of true happiness or the danger of ambition . And then we would suddenly be cackling again . We were , in other word , getting high on Steves ’ s “ High Notes . ”
 He kept reading .
 “ I ’ ve been craning my mind to see you , ” he said .
 “ I feel like a hungry bird , but I won ’ t eat any worm I don ’ t like . ”
 Steves showed me complex analytical graph about true love and divorce rate , about the way music sound when you ’ re high versus sober , about the degree of honesty possible with the various people in your life . ( “ Scale of Unconditional Regard , ” this last one wa called . ) One page of the journal had a strand of hair taped to it , labeled “ split end. ” There wa a drawing of a woman ’ s breast . And of course there were many , many more description of getting high itself . “ Getting high is like roasting an English muffin , ” Steves read . “ You start out cold and doughy , and you toast it to a crisp brown , and just a little more and you get all black and burned . ”
 At some point , he looked up from the journal . “ To me , ” he said , “ this is a precious thing . Because this is me . ”
 He kept reading .
 “ Time spent socially is time spent at the expense of personal betterment , ” he said .
 He shook his head . That ’ s how he had thought when he wa young . “ That ’ s my problem , ” he added ruefully . “ I work all the time . ”
 Then he kept reading .
 “ When I die , ” he read , “ scatter me all over the budget hotel of Europe . ”

 When my wife and I were married , my mother-in-law told u she had a special gift for u . I wasn ’ t sure what to expect . She didn ’ t tell u what the gift wa , but she did tell u where it wa . In Sweden , on an island , in the forest .
 As with all magical place , getting to the island in Sweden requires some effort ( particularly a my wife , son and I live in Los Angeles ) . After the plane , the train and a car ride to the countryside , a boat ferry u across the lake from the mainland . There are only a handful of cottage — with no electricity or running water — on the island . It hasn ’ t been developed ( and , I hope , never will be ) . The forest service long ago gave over the island ’ s forest management to nature , so the place is thick with tree : gangly evergreen and white birch , a well a wildflower , blueberry plant and many others . The island is only about 50 acre , but it ’ s quite easy to get lost . Distances walking in the forest are hard to determine . You spend so much time walking over , under and around branch , brush and fallen tree that a simple hike can quickly become a disorienting journey . There are no straight line in a forest .
 In Sweden , mushroom are like gold . Specifically chanterelle mushroom . Aside from their high cost and their subtle earthy flavor ( cooked in butter and served on toast ) , their value is enhanced by how late in the season they grow . So Swedes are extremely protective of their chanterelle patch . And though the custom of allemansratten ( “ freedom to roam ” ) allows everyone access to walk and forage on all land , when a patch is discovered deep in the forest , people sometimes record the GPS coordinate and pas them down like a closely guarded secret .

 The day my mother-in-law took u for our first walk , everything seemed slow and quiet ( besides the buzz of the mosquito ) . I listened to her tell story of playing here a a child ; exploring it made me feel young , and nostalgic for a past I had never lived . I marched behind my wife and wa careful when stepping over fallen tree or catching branch she bent back to allow me to pas . I noticed too that color were brighter — particularly the striking golden-yellow chanterelle , whose unusual billowing shape sometimes reminded me of linen blowing on a clothesline or tiny version of Marilyn Monroe ’ s dress in “ The Seven Year Itch. ” Once I reoriented myself to searching like this , it became sport to find them . Some mushroom you can eat , and some can make you very sick . Animals know this , and people who spend lot of time in the forest know this . My mother-in-law know .
 I wasn ’ t sure how far we had walked , and I would not even have seen the path if it weren ’ t for my mother-in-law ’ s pointing it out . She took u to a clearing among some tree , looked around a bit , then stopped and bent down . She carefully pulled back some leaf and brush and said , “ This is for you. ” It wa a small patch of chanterelle mushroom : a cluster of about five or six undulating golden nugget jutting out of the dark , wet ground . She said she had given each of her child a patch in the forest where she found that mushroom consistently grew each year . “ Some year the animal get to them first , ” she said , “ but we ’ re lucky this year . ”
 It ’ s winter now , and we are back in Los Angeles . But I find myself thinking a lot about my mother-in-law ’ s gava , her gift — our tiny plot of mushroom . The quiet of the forest , maybe it ’ s snowing , maybe it ’ s dark . It ’ s strangely comforting to think of something so small and delicate and so far away — our small space alone on it island where we will return year after year .

 The particular sheen of America by Amtrak .
 By CAITY WEAVER
 Holly Andres
 Tell your fellow american that you plan to cross the United States by train , and their reaction will range from amusement at your spellbinding eccentricity to naked horror that they , through some fatal social miscalculation , have become acquainted with a person who would plan to cross the United States by train . Depending how you slice it — time or money — there are either 61 or 960 immediate reason not to travel by Amtrak train from New York City to Los Angeles . Those are the extra hour and dollar , respectively , that you might reasonably expect to forfeit if you forgo a six-hour $ 129 nonstop flight and opt instead for an Amtrak sleeper car . Covering the interjacent 2,448.8 mile can easily consume some 67 hour for a mind-boggling $ 1,089 .
 Of course , you might remind your quote-unquote fellow , any form of modern engine-based transport , even Amtrak , is preposterously fast compared with the method that Homo sapiens employed to move ourselves and , more important , our tchotchke for most of our specie ’ 300,000-year history , which is walking . Crossing the stretch of land where roughly half the Donner party starved , froze or , in the case of the group ’ s two Miwok guide , were shot to death for food — an overland journey that took the party about five month to complete in 1847 — could be done in under two hour by a Honda Accord today , assuming normal traffic , while a plane from Springfield , Ill. , their starting point , to Sacramento would zoom over their whole route in half a day , including layover . Because of this ability to effectively teleport between location , 21st-century Americans have become flippant about transcontinental voyaging . To truly appreciate the size of the landmass ( the third-largest country in the world by land area ) and the variety of it terrain ( rain forest , desert , prairie , Margaritaville , etc . ) , you have to see it from the ground .
 Amtrak cling to the hope that someday people will view it service not a something that suck and that they hate , but a something that is actually nice and that they don ’ t hate . There ’ s a whole separate Amtrak website dedicated to this dream ( AmtrakVacations.com ) , where Amtrak doe thing like describe Los Angeles to people who have never heard of it . “ The ‘ City of Angels ’ is one of the premier attraction in sunny Southern California. ” But the other selling point of a cross-country train trip is a chance to look behind the American scrim : to learn where the nation make and store the hidden part that run it , to find new place you wish you had been born , to spy on backyard and high school football field whose possible existence had never occurred to you . Or me . Why not me ? My boyfriend and I were planning a short vacation out West anyway . I could just leave a few day before him and get there after he arrived .
 As I quickly learned , there are no passenger rail route that cross the entire United States in a single trip , nor are there likely to be any soon . Even proponent of the high-speed railway system much lauded in Asia and Europe ( and tentatively proposed in Congress ’ s Green New Deal resolution ) generally give the competitive edge to plane for travel across distance greater than 600 mile . At present , reaching California by rail from New York requires at least two train , one of which will depart from New Orleans or Chicago , all of which , like most line operated by Amtrak , have name so sumptuously picturesque ( Maple Leaf , Coast Starlight , Sunset Limited ) they make the storybook “ Polar Express ” sound a sterile a “ Amtrak ” by comparison . To book ticket , a person must first complete a battery of test measuring her patience , hand-eye coordination and aptitude for deductive mathematical reasoning , in the guise of Amtrak ’ s impossible-to-use online trip planner . ( While the trip planner can not identify the train station nearest to an address , or even a city , it can tell you the name of the city you have already typed into it search bar , provided there is an Amtrak train station there . ) The fastest way to complete this slow journey is to take the Lake Shore Limited to Chicago ’ s Union Station , then board the Southwest Chief to Los Angeles , one of sunny Southern California ’ s much-hyped premier attraction .
 Contrary to multiple acquaintance ’ declaration that I would encounter “ some real weirdo ” on the train , the first person I met on board my first sleeper car after boarding the train in Penn Station wa a man in a sparkly cardigan and leather pant who breezily identified himself a “ a prophet , ” which is perhaps the world ’ s second-oldest profession . And forgive me if I find nothing “ weird ” about being gainfully employed under a supervisor with the kind of multinational name recognition God ha .
 As he doubtless expected , the prophet and I were in opposite Viewliner roomette — private compartment Amtrak describes a “ designed for one or two passenger , ” although a roomette is both narrower and shorter than a standard porta potty . What Amtrak ha managed to cram into this minuscule space is impressive : a fold-down sink , two cushioned bench that convert to a bed , a second premade bed that lower from the ceiling , a tiny foldout table with an inset of alternating colored square for checker or chess , a coat hook , a luggage cubby , a large picture window and the largest variety of not-quite-matching shade of dark blue upholstery fabric ever assembled . There is even a small metal toilet covered with a puce-colored lid , which invite the brainteaser : Is it more luxurious to have a private toilet inch away from your sleeping area , or a shared toilet elsewhere ?
 The prophet sat silently in his compartment with the curtain open .
 [ See a voyage by train through Nigeria . ]
 The car ’ s friendly attendant advised me that the recommended way to enter the upper berth wa to step first atop the toilet seat ( a little over a foot off the ground ) , then , using a wall-mounted handle for balance , climb onto the narrow built-in ledge above the toilet , rotate my body 90 degree and , fueled by a cocktail of optimism and derring-do , launch myself into the bed suspended in midair . To prevent occupant from rolling off their 28-inch-wide mattress ( the same width a a standard casket ) and falling several foot to the floor , stowed beneath the mattress of every upper bunk is a kind of net of seatbelt that hook with grim determination into the ceiling . Once on the bed , I subjected my body to a series of Cirque du Soleil-inspired experiment to confirm that this safety web would indeed hold my weight , were I to roll unconsciously into it at 2 a.m . I tested the strength of the strap with one leg . I rolled from the wall into the net , flopping my limb . I placed each hand on a segment of net and pushed against it with the full force of my upper body , something that I had never done in my sleep but that now seemed possible or even probable . It seemed secure .
 It also seemed representative of Amtrak ’ s casual , makeshift approach to passenger — a slightly refreshing , slightly unnerving attitude to encounter after a lifetime of air travel . The freedom to move about in a train evokes an illicit , almost danger-courting autonomy . ( The nonprofit National Safety Council report that a person in the United States is several time more likely to die of “ sharp object ” than a plane or train crash , though the event that preceded the recent emergency Boeing grounding make such statistic cold comfort . )
 The instruction given by conductor and attendant were not so much formulaic a they were desperately obvious — a black comic litany of bare-minimum survival tip . “ Just for your safety please do not walk or play on these track , ” went one announcement . Another asked parent to ensure young child did not “ wander around the train alone. ” Although there wa no whiff of a T.S.A . screening in place ( it would presumably be possible for someone to arrive one minute before departure carrying a duffel bag of uranium and sword and hop right on , although hopefully no one will ) , pantomime of security distributed responsibility among everyone aboard . “ WE ’ RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER ... LITERALLY ” read the text on a safety brochure promoting Amtrak ’ s “ If You See Something , Say Something ” campaign .
 Even on short plane trip , every passenger is offered the kindergartner ’ s communion of juice and cooky , a if a majority of adult are incapable of going 90 minute without such provision . On train , passenger are treated a individual even more powerful than adult : independent teenager who just want to smoke . Amtrak know you want to smoke . Amtrak know you love to smoke . But while you ’ re living under Amtrak ’ s roof , you have to follow the rule , of which there is only one , and that is : Don ’ t smoke inside .
 “ Albany is going to be a smoke break , ” a young male voice declared over the intercom a the train hurtled northward . “ Just a reminder , lady and gentleman , ” a voice like that of a female jazz radio D.J . warned on a westbound train . “ This is a completely nonsmoking train. ” She added : “ Your first official stop for a smoke break is Kansas City , Mo . ”
 In winter , the 3:40 Lake Shore Limited experience just 90 minute of daylight before darkness descends for a majority of it journey west to Chicago . The first leg of the trip follows the Hudson River , revealing glimpse of hidden island and idyllic ruin — like the crumbling remains of a fanciful 20th-century castle built by an arm dealer in need of an out-of-the-way place to stash his store of live ammunition , some of which eventually exploded , creating the crumbling remains . At sunset , when all that wa left of the day wa a tangelo slash along the horizon , that same color flashed up from partly melted ice crater that caught the light a the train chugged past . Suddenly , the air outside the train became crow — thousand of crow , rushing in from all angle and alighting on the blue-white frozen river , a if deposited there by an unseen hand .
 Sleep the first night came easily and , a it wa interrupted several time , frequently . After performing the traditional nighttime ritual of climbing atop the toilet and carefully catapulting into bed , I wa rewarded with the gentle rocking of a hammock experiencing a constant minor earthquake tremor . The atmosphere on board wa librarylike ; even the periodic train whistle sounded very far away , a if in someone else ’ s dream .
 [ How to spend 47 hour on a train and not go crazy . ]
 The most unifying characteristic of my fellow passenger wa not age ( although , a a rule , the sleeping car skewed retired ) , race ( very mixed ) , income ( while sleeper are astronomically priced , coach seat can be downright economical for shorter segment ) or even fear of flying ( no one I spoke to had it ) ; it wa their relaxed , easygoing , train-lulled contentment . To opt to travel long distance via Amtrak — a method deemed “ on time ” just 71.2 percent of the time by it own generous metric — is to say : As long a I get there eventually , I ’ m satisfied .
 Train people are content to stare out the window for hour , like indoor cat . The trouble with the Lake Shore Limited is that the amount of enjoyment it is possible to derive from staring out the window of a train is inversely proportional to the population density of the land you are traversing . People need thing , and unfortunately most of those thing are ugly to look at . Many of them are gray . Views picked up considerably when , after a five-hour layover in Chicago , I transferred onto the Southwest Chief , a double-decker “ Superliner ” with many of it coach seat , sleeping quarter and lounge on the top level . Sightseer Lounges are the crown jewel of Amtrak ’ s long-distance train : entire car of retro-futuristic curved floor-to-ceiling window where passenger can sit at table or outward-facing upholstered chair and watch the scenery streak by . Shortly into it route , the Chief pass the single best thing in the United States : a silo in Mendota , Ill. , with an 80-by-20-foot ear of corn painted on one side .
 Train people are also individual for whom small talk is a invigorating a a rail of cocaine . For them , every meal on board Amtrak ( communal seating like a Benihana , reservation only , included with the price of a sleeping-car ticket , check in with the dining-car attendant ) is a rager . A white middle-aged man in motorcycle gear discussed leukemia treatment with a swish black grandmother . Another man , while gathering up armful of research book from a table , bid farewell to a farmer and suggested that he might run into him on the same train next year . I wa seated at dinner with an Amish couple traveling to Arizona for a construction job , and by the time our Amtrak Signature Steaks with optional Béarnaise sauce arrived ( the food is on a par with the fourth-best airplane meal you could ever imagine ) , we were deep in a conversation about one of my favorite topic , which is myself . I offered a tip I ’ d learned about cleaning up glitter using dryer sheet , and they laughed a they tried to envision a situation in which this information could ever be useful .
 “ ‘ Who told you that ? ’ ” the husband asked himself , anticipating companion ’ question . “ ‘ Some girl that writes in The New York Times ! ’ ”
 “ They ’ d never believe u , ” mused his wife , who had ordered cheesecake for dinner .
 At another meal , my table mate were a Missouri-based retired physician and her husband , a retired special-ed teacher , plus a retired architect from Arizona who wa traveling alone . In the middle of a conversation about how they met their spouse , the architect suddenly seemed preoccupied with his iPhone . “ I read one where it said , ” he muttered into his chest , “ ‘ Keep your photo of your wife when you met her. ’ ” He lifted the phone and showed the table his lock screen : a black-and-white photo of a beautiful young woman in 1960s dress . I barely managed not to cry into my Land & Sea entree ( Amtrak Signature Steak with optional Béarnaise sauce , plus additional crab , shrimp and scallop cake ) .
 Back in my warm little room , there wa something I couldn ’ t put my finger on that made it subtly nicer than my Lake Shore Limited accommodation , and that wa the in-room toilet , because this roomette did not have one . I had been given a stationary pointing tour of the compartment by the Chief ’ s sleeping-car attendant — a middle-aged woman from a small town in Mexico , who , like every Amtrak attendant with whom I interacted over the course of three day , hummed along with the unflustered friendliness of a benevolent spirit continuing to go about it business in a hotel decade after the property ha been converted into luxury condo . Her soothing voice made everything she said sound like the hurried recitation of a familiar recipe . Her assessment of me — “ You are on vacation , you probably want to close the curtain and sleep and sleep , wake up and eat and then go and take another nap , it ’ s O.K. , that ’ s why you are on vacation ” — wa delivered all in one breath .
 Kansas share a border with Colorado . I never could have imagined that I would one day say this , and I know many people will be disconcerted by the statement . They will wonder if , this whole time , they have been reading an avant-garde work of science fiction , or perhaps a Mad Lib . “ Is magical realism always this scary ? ” they will ask themselves . Some will claim I am lying . Many will assume I am wrong , demented or a clumsy typist .
 To all of whom I respond : The truth of our nation ’ s internal demarcation is stranger than fiction — stranger than even the kind of brilliant avant-garde science fiction I am most likely capable of producing yet choose not to . But the unvarnished fact is Colorado ha to start somewhere , and for whatever reason , that ’ s inside Kansas .
 I woke in Colorado to a weather phenomenon called the pogonip — freezing fog that condensed on tree limb and sagebrush until they looked dusted with powdered sugar . The terrain of the Colorado tableland is so flat that it seemed possible to detect the exact location where the pogonip ended and blue sky began , the margin of the changing landscape revealing themselves a definitively a gutter between panel of a newspaper comic .
 A childlike compulsion to identify distant cow rippled through the observation car a we hurried along . So fast did we fly past baby deer that the “ aw ! ” s caught in our throat . Whichever way you face , you are privy to an all-day show , although there is a nagging sensation that by being focused in one direction , you are missing something spectacular unfolding in another . Sometimes you are . Sometimes other people will even tell you you are , like when a grizzled stranger sat down next to me , close enough to be way too close , jerked his head behind u , growled , “ That ’ s Pikes Peak ” and walked away . Unknown to me , on the north side of the train , the Rockies had just begun to loom up out of the prairie .
 Azure and golden orange were the color of the afternoon . Action-movie poster are dominated by this color combination , famous for it vibrancy , and indeed , a horizon filled with just these hue seemed to draw the Sightseer Lounge into a kind of trance . For a long while there wa nothing but sky and earth to observe — I saw actual tumbleweed somersault by — yet everyone , me included , remained riveted to the window . It wa possible , in the Sightseer Lounge , to watch weather roll in from a great distance , even from one side of the car to the other . As we ascended hill covered in pinyon and juniper , flake began to fall , and soon we were in a winter forest . As quickly a we had entered the snowscape , however , we were back in dusty New Mexican grassland , rolling through a hailstorm of white bird .
 Sunset pushed the denizen of the Sightseer Lounge to the brink of insanity , a all but the Amish frantically tried to capture the flame-colored sky on our cellphone camera . A companionable mother I met earlier in the day , accompanying her own parent on a casino trip to Nevada , dashed from another car to make sure I wa facing out of the best side of the lounge to photograph the heaven . When the sun dipped below the horizon , the sky turned the color of wet slate , then dark denim blue with a pale apricot smear that we chased west for several mile .
 Scale on a rail trip is what ’ s most arresting . We live so much of our life close-up — scrolling through phone , watching our type appear on computer screen , scrutinizing paper , preparing meal , cleaning our home room by room . Very few element of our day-to-day task remain out of arm ’ reach . An extended train ride affords a chance not just to see a horizon but also to soak it up . To luxuriate in the far-off for uninterrupted hour . To exist , briefly , in the uncharted section of the cellphone-coverage map .
 And it feel a if you ’ re getting away with something — seeing more than you deserve . The best part of the trip wasn ’ t spying on the backyard of house ; it wa out here , in the open . The bright hue of the nation ’ s choropleth population-density map fade to white in these area , yet many of the most beautiful habitable part of the United States , no offense to Boston , are contained within those colorless expanse . Amtrak take advantage of this circumstance . It is fortunate that it route were laid during a period of industrious optimism , when everyone assumed the West would soon be made a unbearable a the East ; if they had known it would remain beautiful , it would have been difficult to justify the financial investment .
 Lying in my berth , I felt a happy a an egg in an incubator with no plan to hatch . My mood wa so upbeat that when I spotted a vitamin on the carpet , I optimistically assumed it wa the one I ’ d been keeping in my pocket for week but forgetting to take , and I popped it in my mouth , reminding myself to look up the writing stamped on it later . It turned out to have been a supplement for adult 50 and over . I had become train-lulled .
 When I awoke on the third day , we were about an hour behind schedule . It had happened , our attendant explained , when assistance for a handicapped passenger wa slow to arrive at an overnight stop . “ We can ’ t rush them ! ” she chided ( referring , presumably , to the passenger rather than the assistance ) , though delay appeared to have dampened no mood ; it meant that the sun rose over the San Bernardino Mountains at breakfast . As we approached our final destination , the scenery deteriorated , the red rock vista replaced by heap of wooden pallet stacked in strip-mall parking lot . When we pulled into the last stop on the line , the train wa almost empty . I had surveyed thousand of mile of panoramic splendor , and I couldn ’ t believe I had come all that way just to get to Los Angeles .

Covering the interjacent 2,448.8 mile can easily consume some 67 hour for a mind-boggling $ 1,089 .
 Of course , you might remind your quote-unquote fellow , any form of modern engine-based transport , even Amtrak , is preposterously fast compared with the method that Homo sapiens employed to move ourselves and , more important , our tchotchke for most of our specie ’ 300,000-year history , which is walking . Crossing the stretch of land where roughly half the Donner party starved , froze or , in the case of the group ’ s two Miwok guide , were shot to death for food — an overland journey that took the party about five month to complete in 1847 — could be done in under two hour by a Honda Accord today , assuming normal traffic , while a plane from Springfield , Ill. , their starting point , to Sacramento would zoom over their whole route in half a day , including layover . Because of this ability to effectively teleport between location , 21st-century Americans have become flippant about transcontinental voyaging . To truly appreciate the size of the landmass ( the third-largest country in the world by land area ) and the variety of it terrain ( rain forest , desert , prairie , Margaritaville , etc . ) , you have to see it from the ground .
 Amtrak cling to the hope that someday people will view it service not a something that suck and that they hate , but a something that is actually nice and that they don ’ t hate . There ’ s a whole separate Amtrak website dedicated to this dream ( AmtrakVacations.com ) , where Amtrak doe thing like describe Los Angeles to people who have never heard of it . “ The ‘ City of Angels ’ is one of the premier attraction in sunny Southern California. ” But the other selling point of a cross-country train trip is a chance to look behind the American scrim : to learn where the nation make and store the hidden part that run it , to find new place you wish you had been born , to spy on backyard and high school football field whose possible existence had never occurred to you . Or me . Why not me ? My boyfriend and I were planning a short vacation out West anyway . I could just leave a few day before him and get there after he arrived .
 As I quickly learned , there are no passenger rail route that cross the entire United States in a single trip , nor are there likely to be any soon . Even proponent of the high-speed railway system much lauded in Asia and Europe ( and tentatively proposed in Congress ’ s Green New Deal resolution ) generally give the competitive edge to plane for travel across distance greater than 600 mile . At present , reaching California by rail from New York requires at least two train , one of which will depart from New Orleans or Chicago , all of which , like most line operated by Amtrak , have name so sumptuously picturesque ( Maple Leaf , Coast Starlight , Sunset Limited ) they make the storybook “ Polar Express ” sound a sterile a “ Amtrak ” by comparison . To book ticket , a person must first complete a battery of test measuring her patience , hand-eye coordination and aptitude for deductive mathematical reasoning , in the guise of Amtrak ’ s impossible-to-use online trip planner . ( While the trip planner can not identify the train station nearest to an address , or even a city , it can tell you the name of the city you have already typed into it search bar , provided there is an Amtrak train station there . ) The fastest way to complete this slow journey is to take the Lake Shore Limited to Chicago ’ s Union Station , then board the Southwest Chief to Los Angeles , one of sunny Southern California ’ s much-hyped premier attraction .
 Contrary to multiple acquaintance ’ declaration that I would encounter “ some real weirdo ” on the train , the first person I met on board my first sleeper car after boarding the train in Penn Station wa a man in a sparkly cardigan and leather pant who breezily identified himself a “ a prophet , ” which is perhaps the world ’ s second-oldest profession . And forgive me if I find nothing “ weird ” about being gainfully employed under a supervisor with the kind of multinational name recognition God ha .
 As he doubtless expected , the prophet and I were in opposite Viewliner roomette — private compartment Amtrak describes a “ designed for one or two passenger , ” although a roomette is both narrower and shorter than a standard porta potty . What Amtrak ha managed to cram into this minuscule space is impressive : a fold-down sink , two cushioned bench that convert to a bed , a second premade bed that lower from the ceiling , a tiny foldout table with an inset of alternating colored square for checker or chess , a coat hook , a luggage cubby , a large picture window and the largest variety of not-quite-matching shade of dark blue upholstery fabric ever assembled . There is even a small metal toilet covered with a puce-colored lid , which invite the brainteaser : Is it more luxurious to have a private toilet inch away from your sleeping area , or a shared toilet elsewhere ?
 The prophet sat silently in his compartment with the curtain open .
 [ See a voyage by train through Nigeria . ]
 The car ’ s friendly attendant advised me that the recommended way to enter the upper berth wa to step first atop the toilet seat ( a little over a foot off the ground ) , then , using a wall-mounted handle for balance , climb onto the narrow built-in ledge above the toilet , rotate my body 90 degree and , fueled by a cocktail of optimism and derring-do , launch myself into the bed suspended in midair . To prevent occupant from rolling off their 28-inch-wide mattress ( the same width a a standard casket ) and falling several foot to the floor , stowed beneath the mattress of every upper bunk is a kind of net of seatbelt that hook with grim determination into the ceiling . Once on the bed , I subjected my body to a series of Cirque du Soleil-inspired experiment to confirm that this safety web would indeed hold my weight , were I to roll unconsciously into it at 2 a.m . I tested the strength of the strap with one leg . I rolled from the wall into the net , flopping my limb . I placed each hand on a segment of net and pushed against it with the full force of my upper body , something that I had never done in my sleep but that now seemed possible or even probable . It seemed secure .
 It also seemed representative of Amtrak ’ s casual , makeshift approach to passenger — a slightly refreshing , slightly unnerving attitude to encounter after a lifetime of air travel . The freedom to move about in a train evokes an illicit , almost danger-courting autonomy . ( The nonprofit National Safety Council report that a person in the United States is several time more likely to die of “ sharp object ” than a plane or train crash , though the event that preceded the recent emergency Boeing grounding make such statistic cold comfort . )
 The instruction given by conductor and attendant were not so much formulaic a they were desperately obvious — a black comic litany of bare-minimum survival tip . “ Just for your safety please do not walk or play on these track , ” went one announcement . Another asked parent to ensure young child did not “ wander around the train alone. ” Although there wa no whiff of a T.S.A . screening in place ( it would presumably be possible for someone to arrive one minute before departure carrying a duffel bag of uranium and sword and hop right on , although hopefully no one will ) , pantomime of security distributed responsibility among everyone aboard . “ WE ’ RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER ... LITERALLY ” read the text on a safety brochure promoting Amtrak ’ s “ If You See Something , Say Something ” campaign .
 Even on short plane trip , every passenger is offered the kindergartner ’ s communion of juice and cooky , a if a majority of adult are incapable of going 90 minute without such provision . On train , passenger are treated a individual even more powerful than adult : independent teenager who just want to smoke . Amtrak know you want to smoke . Amtrak know you love to smoke . But while you ’ re living under Amtrak ’ s roof , you have to follow the rule , of which there is only one , and that is : Don ’ t smoke inside .
 “ Albany is going to be a smoke break , ” a young male voice declared over the intercom a the train hurtled northward . “ Just a reminder , lady and gentleman , ” a voice like that of a female jazz radio D.J . warned on a westbound train . “ This is a completely nonsmoking train. ” She added : “ Your first official stop for a smoke break is Kansas City , Mo . ”
 In winter , the 3:40 Lake Shore Limited experience just 90 minute of daylight before darkness descends for a majority of it journey west to Chicago . The first leg of the trip follows the Hudson River , revealing glimpse of hidden island and idyllic ruin — like the crumbling remains of a fanciful 20th-century castle built by an arm dealer in need of an out-of-the-way place to stash his store of live ammunition , some of which eventually exploded , creating the crumbling remains . At sunset , when all that wa left of the day wa a tangelo slash along the horizon , that same color flashed up from partly melted ice crater that caught the light a the train chugged past . Suddenly , the air outside the train became crow — thousand of crow , rushing in from all angle and alighting on the blue-white frozen river , a if deposited there by an unseen hand .
 Sleep the first night came easily and , a it wa interrupted several time , frequently . After performing the traditional nighttime ritual of climbing atop the toilet and carefully catapulting into bed , I wa rewarded with the gentle rocking of a hammock experiencing a constant minor earthquake tremor . The atmosphere on board wa librarylike ; even the periodic train whistle sounded very far away , a if in someone else ’ s dream .
 [ How to spend 47 hour on a train and not go crazy . ]
 The most unifying characteristic of my fellow passenger wa not age ( although , a a rule , the sleeping car skewed retired ) , race ( very mixed ) , income ( while sleeper are astronomically priced , coach seat can be downright economical for shorter segment ) or even fear of flying ( no one I spoke to had it ) ; it wa their relaxed , easygoing , train-lulled contentment . To opt to travel long distance via Amtrak — a method deemed “ on time ” just 71.2 percent of the time by it own generous metric — is to say : As long a I get there eventually , I ’ m satisfied .
 Train people are content to stare out the window for hour , like indoor cat . The trouble with the Lake Shore Limited is that the amount of enjoyment it is possible to derive from staring out the window of a train is inversely proportional to the population density of the land you are traversing . People need thing , and unfortunately most of those thing are ugly to look at . Many of them are gray . Views picked up considerably when , after a five-hour layover in Chicago , I transferred onto the Southwest Chief , a double-decker “ Superliner ” with many of it coach seat , sleeping quarter and lounge on the top level . Sightseer Lounges are the crown jewel of Amtrak ’ s long-distance train : entire car of retro-futuristic curved floor-to-ceiling window where passenger can sit at table or outward-facing upholstered chair and watch the scenery streak by . Shortly into it route , the Chief pass the single best thing in the United States : a silo in Mendota , Ill. , with an 80-by-20-foot ear of corn painted on one side .
 Train people are also individual for whom small talk is a invigorating a a rail of cocaine . For them , every meal on board Amtrak ( communal seating like a Benihana , reservation only , included with the price of a sleeping-car ticket , check in with the dining-car attendant ) is a rager . A white middle-aged man in motorcycle gear discussed leukemia treatment with a swish black grandmother . Another man , while gathering up armful of research book from a table , bid farewell to a farmer and suggested that he might run into him on the same train next year . I wa seated at dinner with an Amish couple traveling to Arizona for a construction job , and by the time our Amtrak Signature Steaks with optional Béarnaise sauce arrived ( the food is on a par with the fourth-best airplane meal you could ever imagine ) , we were deep in a conversation about one of my favorite topic , which is myself . I offered a tip I ’ d learned about cleaning up glitter using dryer sheet , and they laughed a they tried to envision a situation in which this information could ever be useful .
 “ ‘ Who told you that ? ’ ” the husband asked himself , anticipating companion ’ question . “ ‘ Some girl that writes in The New York Times ! ’ ”
 “ They ’ d never believe u , ” mused his wife , who had ordered cheesecake for dinner .
 At another meal , my table mate were a Missouri-based retired physician and her husband , a retired special-ed teacher , plus a retired architect from Arizona who wa traveling alone . In the middle of a conversation about how they met their spouse , the architect suddenly seemed preoccupied with his iPhone . “ I read one where it said , ” he muttered into his chest , “ ‘ Keep your photo of your wife when you met her. ’ ” He lifted the phone and showed the table his lock screen : a black-and-white photo of a beautiful young woman in 1960s dress . I barely managed not to cry into my Land & Sea entree ( Amtrak Signature Steak with optional Béarnaise sauce , plus additional crab , shrimp and scallop cake ) .
 Back in my warm little room , there wa something I couldn ’ t put my finger on that made it subtly nicer than my Lake Shore Limited accommodation , and that wa the in-room toilet , because this roomette did not have one . I had been given a stationary pointing tour of the compartment by the Chief ’ s sleeping-car attendant — a middle-aged woman from a small town in Mexico , who , like every Amtrak attendant with whom I interacted over the course of three day , hummed along with the unflustered friendliness of a benevolent spirit continuing to go about it business in a hotel decade after the property ha been converted into luxury condo . Her soothing voice made everything she said sound like the hurried recitation of a familiar recipe . Her assessment of me — “ You are on vacation , you probably want to close the curtain and sleep and sleep , wake up and eat and then go and take another nap , it ’ s O.K. , that ’ s why you are on vacation ” — wa delivered all in one breath .
 Kansas share a border with Colorado . I never could have imagined that I would one day say this , and I know many people will be disconcerted by the statement . They will wonder if , this whole time , they have been reading an avant-garde work of science fiction , or perhaps a Mad Lib . “ Is magical realism always this scary ? ” they will ask themselves . Some will claim I am lying . Many will assume I am wrong , demented or a clumsy typist .
 To all of whom I respond : The truth of our nation ’ s internal demarcation is stranger than fiction — stranger than even the kind of brilliant avant-garde science fiction I am most likely capable of producing yet choose not to . But the unvarnished fact is Colorado ha to start somewhere , and for whatever reason , that ’ s inside Kansas .
 I woke in Colorado to a weather phenomenon called the pogonip — freezing fog that condensed on tree limb and sagebrush until they looked dusted with powdered sugar . The terrain of the Colorado tableland is so flat that it seemed possible to detect the exact location where the pogonip ended and blue sky began , the margin of the changing landscape revealing themselves a definitively a gutter between panel of a newspaper comic .
 A childlike compulsion to identify distant cow rippled through the observation car a we hurried along . So fast did we fly past baby deer that the “ aw ! ” s caught in our throat . Whichever way you face , you are privy to an all-day show , although there is a nagging sensation that by being focused in one direction , you are missing something spectacular unfolding in another . Sometimes you are . Sometimes other people will even tell you you are , like when a grizzled stranger sat down next to me , close enough to be way too close , jerked his head behind u , growled , “ That ’ s Pikes Peak ” and walked away . Unknown to me , on the north side of the train , the Rockies had just begun to loom up out of the prairie .
 Azure and golden orange were the color of the afternoon . Action-movie poster are dominated by this color combination , famous for it vibrancy , and indeed , a horizon filled with just these hue seemed to draw the Sightseer Lounge into a kind of trance . For a long while there wa nothing but sky and earth to observe — I saw actual tumbleweed somersault by — yet everyone , me included , remained riveted to the window . It wa possible , in the Sightseer Lounge , to watch weather roll in from a great distance , even from one side of the car to the other . As we ascended hill covered in pinyon and juniper , flake began to fall , and soon we were in a winter forest . As quickly a we had entered the snowscape , however , we were back in dusty New Mexican grassland , rolling through a hailstorm of white bird .
 Sunset pushed the denizen of the Sightseer Lounge to the brink of insanity , a all but the Amish frantically tried to capture the flame-colored sky on our cellphone camera . A companionable mother I met earlier in the day , accompanying her own parent on a casino trip to Nevada , dashed from another car to make sure I wa facing out of the best side of the lounge to photograph the heaven . When the sun dipped below the horizon , the sky turned the color of wet slate , then dark denim blue with a pale apricot smear that we chased west for several mile .
 Scale on a rail trip is what ’ s most arresting . We live so much of our life close-up — scrolling through phone , watching our type appear on computer screen , scrutinizing paper , preparing meal , cleaning our home room by room . Very few element of our day-to-day task remain out of arm ’ reach . An extended train ride affords a chance not just to see a horizon but also to soak it up . To luxuriate in the far-off for uninterrupted hour . To exist , briefly , in the uncharted section of the cellphone-coverage map .
 And it feel a if you ’ re getting away with something — seeing more than you deserve . The best part of the trip wasn ’ t spying on the backyard of house ; it wa out here , in the open . The bright hue of the nation ’ s choropleth population-density map fade to white in these area , yet many of the most beautiful habitable part of the United States , no offense to Boston , are contained within those colorless expanse . Amtrak take advantage of this circumstance . It is fortunate that it route were laid during a period of industrious optimism , when everyone assumed the West would soon be made a unbearable a the East ; if they had known it would remain beautiful , it would have been difficult to justify the financial investment .
 Lying in my berth , I felt a happy a an egg in an incubator with no plan to hatch . My mood wa so upbeat that when I spotted a vitamin on the carpet , I optimistically assumed it wa the one I ’ d been keeping in my pocket for week but forgetting to take , and I popped it in my mouth , reminding myself to look up the writing stamped on it later . It turned out to have been a supplement for adult 50 and over . I had become train-lulled .
 When I awoke on the third day , we were about an hour behind schedule . It had happened , our attendant explained , when assistance for a handicapped passenger wa slow to arrive at an overnight stop . “ We can ’ t rush them ! ” she chided ( referring , presumably , to the passenger rather than the assistance ) , though delay appeared to have dampened no mood ; it meant that the sun rose over the San Bernardino Mountains at breakfast . As we approached our final destination , the scenery deteriorated , the red rock vista replaced by heap of wooden pallet stacked in strip-mall parking lot . When we pulled into the last stop on the line , the train wa almost empty . I had surveyed thousand of mile of panoramic splendor , and I couldn ’ t believe I had come all that way just to get to Los Angeles .

 The travel guru belief the tiniest exposure to other culture will change Americans ’ entire life .

 Rick Steves can tell you how to avoid having your pocket picked on the subway in Istanbul . He can tell you where to buy cooky from cloistered Spanish nun on a hilltop in Andalusia . He can tell you approximately what percentage of Russia ’ s gross domestic product come from bribery . He can teach you the magic idiom that unlocks perfectly complementary gelato flavor in Florence ( “ What marries well ? ” ) .
 But Rick Steves doe not know his way around New York City .
 “ In the Western Hemisphere , ” Steves told me one afternoon last March , “ I am a terrible traveler . ”
 We were , at that moment , very much inside the Western Hemisphere , 4,000 mile west of Rome , inching through Manhattan in a hired black car . Steves wa in the middle of a grueling speaking tour of the United States : 21 city in 34 day . New York wa stop No.17 . He had just flown in from Pittsburgh , where he had spent le than 24 hour , and he would soon be off to Los Angeles , Denver and Dallas . In his brief window of down time , Steves did not go out searching for quaint restaurant or architectural treasure . He sat alone in his hotel room , clacking away on his laptop , working on new project . His whole world , for the time being , had been reduced to a concrete blur of airport , hotel , lecture hall and medium appearance .
 In this town car , however , rolling through Midtown , Steves wa brimming with delight . He wa between a TV interview at the New York Stock Exchange and a podcast at CBS , and he seemed a enchanted by all the big-city bustle a the most wide-eyed tourist .
 “ Look at all the building ! ” he exclaimed . “ There ’ s so much energy ! Man , oh , man ! ”
 A woman crossed the street pushing two Yorkies in a stroller .


 “ How cute ! ” Steves shouted .
 The town car crawled toward a shabby metal hulk spanning the East River .
 “ Wow ! ” Steves said . “ Is that the Brooklyn Bridge ? ”
 It wa almost the opposite of the Brooklyn Bridge . The Brooklyn Bridge is one of the most recognizable structure in the world : a stretched stone cathedral . This wa it unloved upriver cousin , a tangle of discolored metal , vibrating with car , perpetually under construction . The driver told Steves that it wa the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge — or , a most New Yorkers still thought of it , the 59th Street Bridge .
 This revelation only increased Steves ’ s wonder .
 “ The 59th Street Bridge ! ” he said . “ That ’ s one of my favorite song ! ”
 With buoyant enthusiasm , Steves started to sing Simon and Garfunkel ’ s classic 1966 tune “ The 59th Street Bridge Song ( Feelin ’ Groovy ) . ”
 “ Slow down , you move too fast , ” he sang . “ You got to make the mornin ’ last — just — kickin ’ down the cobblestone . ... ”
 The car hit traffic and lurched to a stop . Steves paused to scan the street outside . “ Where are the cobblestone ? ” he asked . Then he refocused . He finished the song with a flourish : “ Lookin ’ for fun and feelin ’ — GROOOVYYYYYY ! ”
 There wa a silence in the car .
 “ Can you imagine those two guy walking around right here ? ” Steves said . “ Just feeling groovy ? Gosh , that ’ s cool . ”
 Steves pulled out his phone and , for his online fan , recorded a video of himself singing “ The 59th Street Bridge Song ( Feelin ’ Groovy ) . ”
 “ It ’ s fun to be in New York City , ” he signed off . “ Happy travel ! ”
 There wa another silence in the car , this one longer .
 “ You know , ” the driver said finally , “ you ’ re not very different than you are on your show . ”
 This wa correct . The driver wa referring to Steves ’ s long-running , widely syndicated , family-friendly public-television travel series , “ Rick Steves ’ Europe , ” on which Steves is a joyful and jaunty host , all eager-beaver smile and expressive head tilt . With a backpack over one shoulder and a hand tucked into his pocket , Steves gush poetically about England ’ s Lake District ( “ a lush land steeped in a rich brew of history , culture and nature ” ) and Erfurt , Germany ( “ this half-timbered medieval town with a shallow river gurgling through it center ” ) and Istanbul ( “ this sprawling metropolis on the Bosporus ” ) and Lisbon ( “ like San Francisco , but older and grittier and le expensive ” ) . He reclines jauntily atop the cliff of Dover and is vigorously scrubbed in a Turkish bath . The show ha aired now for nearly 20 year , and in that time , among traveler , Steves ha established himself a one of the legendary PBS superdorks — right there in the pantheon with Mr. Rogers , Bob Ross and Big Bird . Like them , Steves is a gentle soul who want to help you feel at home in the world . Like them , he seems miraculously untouched by the need to look cool , which of course make him sneakily cool . To the aspiring traveler , Steves is a inspirational a Julia Child once wa to the aspiring home chef .
 [ Read a profile of Terry Gross , the host of “ Fresh Air . ” ]
 Eventually , Steves ’ s busy New York day ended on the Upper East Side , where he wa scheduled to give a talk at a Barnes & Noble . As we drove to the event , Steves confessed that he wasn ’ t sure what kind of crowd he would get . You never knew exactly where his Rickniks ( a the hard-core fan call themselves ) would materialize en masse . Some Steves appearance were mobbed ; others were sparse . His appeal is slightly cultish . For every Ricknik out in the world , a large contingent of average people have no idea who he is .
 I wa mildly skeptical about Steves ’ s drawing power in New York . It wa hard to imagine a bunch of cynical , worldly , urban , polyglot , multicultural East Coast sophisticate — people who probably vacationed at deconsecrated eco-hostels in Oman or Madagascar — getting excited about public television ’ s reigning expert on Europe .
 We arrived , however , to find the bookstore overflowing . A solid wave of applause met Steves at the door . Fans had been pouring in , the organizer told u , for two solid hour . People sat in the aisle and stood in the back . Some wore T-shirts and hat bearing the Rick Steves slogan : “ Keep on Travelin ’ . ” The crowd ’ s body heat overwhelmed the building ’ s climate control .
 I noticed a group of hipster 20-somethings standing near the back , and at first I assumed they had all come sarcastically . But a Steves began to speak , they grinned and laughed with absolute earnestness . Everyone here wa , apparently , a superfan . At one point , Steves showed a slide of tourist swimming in a sunny French river underneath a Roman aqueduct , and the whole crowd gasped . When he mentioned that his website featured a special video devoted to packing light for woman , a woman in the crowd actually pumped her fist .
 At the end of his talk , Steves offered to sign book — but not in the traditional way . There were too many people for a signing table , he said , and anyway , single-file line were always inefficient . ( This is one of his travel credo : avoid waiting in line . ) Instead of sitting down , Steves walked out into the center of the room and invited everyone to open their book and surround him . He pulled out a Sharpie . And then he started to spin . Steves held out his pen and signed book after book after book , fluidly , on the move , smiling a the crowd pressed in . “ We went to Portugal on our honeymoon , ” a man shouted . “ How romantic ! ” Steves answered , still spinning . A woman asked him where to celebrate Christmas in Europe . Steves , in midrotation , still signing furiously , told her that he had made a whole special about precisely that question and that it wa available free on his website . “ Keep on travelin ’ , Rick ! ” someone shouted . “ Keep on travelin ’ ! ” Steves shouted back . As he spun , Steves thanked everyone and gave quick , off-the-cuff advice . In an astonishingly short time , he had signed every book . The people were satisfied . The crowd thinned . Steves finally came to a stop .
 Rick Steves is absolutely American . He wear jean every single day . He drink frozen orange juice from a can . He like his hash brown burned , his coffee extra hot . He dislike most fancy restaurant ; when he ’ s on the road , he prefers to buy a foot-long Subway sandwich and split it between lunch and dinner . He ha a great spontaneous honk of a laugh — it burst out of him , when he is truly delighted , with the sharpness of a firecracker on the Fourth of July . Steves is so completely American that when you stop to really look at his name , you realize it ’ s just the name Rick followed by the plural of Steve — that he is a one-man crowd of absolutely regular everyday American guy : one Rick , many Steves . Although Steves spends nearly half his life traveling , he insists , passionately , that he would never live anywhere but the United States — and you know when he say it that this is absolutely true . In fact , Steves still life in the small Seattle suburb where he grew up , and every morning he walk to work on the same block , downtown , where his parent owned a piano store 50 year ago . On Sundays , Steves wear his jean to church , where he play the conga , with great arm-pumping spirit , in the inspirational soft-rock band that serenade the congregation before the service start , and then he sits down and sings classic Lutheran hymn without even needing to refer to the hymnal . Although Steves ha published many foreign-language phrase book , the only language he speaks fluently is English . He built his business in America , raised his kid in America and give frequent loving paean to the glory of American life .
 And yet : Rick Steves desperately want you to leave America . The tiniest exposure to the outside world , he belief , will change your entire life . Travel , Steves like to say , “ wallop your ethnocentricity ” and “ carbonate your experience ” and “ rearranges your cultural furniture. ” Like sealed window on a hot day , a nation ’ s border can be stultifying . Steves want to crack them open , to let humanity ’ s breeze circulate . The more rootedly American you are , the more Rick Steves want this for you . If you have never had a passport , if you are afraid of the world , if your family would prefer to vacation exclusively at Walt Disney World , if you worry that foreigner are rude and predatory and prone to violence or at least that their food will give you diarrhea , then Steves want you — especially you — to go to Europe . Then he want you to go beyond . ( For a majority of his audience , Steves say , “ Europe is the wading pool for world exploration. ” ) Perhaps , like him , you will need large headphone and half a tab of Ambien to properly relax on the flight , but Steves want you to know that it will be worth it . He want you to stand and make little moaning sound on a cobblestone street the first time you taste authentic Italian gelato — flavor so pure they seem like the primordial essence of peach or melon or pistachio or rice distilled into molecule and stirred directly into your own molecule . He want you to hike on a dirt path along a cliff over the almost-too-blue Mediterranean , with village and vineyard spilling down the rugged mountain above you . He want you to arrive at the Parthenon at dusk , just before it close , when all the tour group are loading back onto their cruise ship , so that you have the whole place to yourself and can stand there feeling like a private witness to the birth , and then the ruination , of Western civilization .
 Steves want you to go to Europe for a long a you can afford to , and he also want to help you afford it . ( Much of his guru energy is focused on cutting cost . ) He want you to go a many time a possible , and while you ’ re there , he want you to get way down deep into the culture , to eat with local in the teeming market , to make a sympathetic fool of yourself , to get entirely lost in your lack of America .
 Out of this paradoxical desire — the enlightenment of Americans through their extraction from America — Steves ha built his quirky travel empire . His guidebook , which started a hand-typed and photocopied information packet for his scraggly 1970s tour group , now dominate the American market ; their distinctive blue-and-yellow spine brighten the travel section of bookstore everywhere . Steves is le interested in reaching sophisticated traveler than he is in converting the uninitiated . ( “ There will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents , ” the Bible tell u , “ than over 99 righteous person who do not need to repent. ” ) Last year , his company led close to 30,000 paying customer on dozen of elaborate European itinerary . Steves teach his follower everything from how to pack a toiletry kit to how to make themselves at home in a small hotel room to how to appreciate a religious tradition they may have been raised to despise . ( In order to enjoy St. Peter ’ s Basilica , Steves admits , he had to learn to “ park my Protestant sword at the door. ” ) He is a sort of spiritual travel agent for America ’ s curious but hesitant middle class . He is simultaneously goofy and dead serious ; he can ping , in an instant , from golly-gee Pollyanna cheerfulness to deep critique of the modern world . In a series of long , affectionate , candid conversation , Steves ’ s colleague described him to me using the word “ sophomoric , ” “ knucklehead ” and “ Santa Claus ” — but also “ juggernaut , ” “ evangelical ” and “ revolutionary. ” Rick Steves want u to travel because it ’ s fun , yes , but also because he belief it might actually save the world .
 I can testify , firsthand , to the power of Rick Steves . In 1998 , he spoke at my college . Nothing about the encounter seemed promising . Our campus wa a tiny outpost in a tiny town , and Steves delivered his talk not in some grand lecture hall but in a drab room in the basement of the student union . I wa poor , shy , anxious , sheltered , repressed and extremely pale . I wa a particular kind of Pacific Northwest white guy — blind to myself and my place in the world . I had never really traveled ; I wa more comfortable on Greyhound bus than on airplane . Going to Europe seemed like something aristocrat did , like fox hunting or debutante ball .
 My girlfriend dragged me to the talk . I had never even heard of Steves . He entered looking like the kind of guy who would bring an acoustic guitar to every single church picnic within a two-hour radius of his favorite Applebee ’ s : large glass , floppy hair , bluejeans , wholesome grin . But what he said over the next hour or so changed the rest of my life .
 It ’ s hard to describe how thoroughly energized Steves becomes in front of a crowd . He pace , gesticulates and speaks very fast . He tell his favorite old joke a if they were eternally new . ( “ Eet smell like zee foot of angel , ” the French cheesemonger always exclaims . ) Onstage , he is a combination of preacher , comedian , salesman , life-hacker , professor and inspirational speaker . Steves told u , that day , how to pack our entire life into a single bag measuring 9 by 22 by 14 inch . ( “ It ’ s enlightened to pack light , ” Steves insists . “ It ’ s a blessing to pack light. ” ) He told u how to find excellent cheap hotel , how to survive on minimalist picnic in public park , how to wash clothing in bathroom sink and how to make friend without sharing a language . Steves ’ s signature book , “ Europe Through the Back Door , ” seemed le like a travel philosophy than a whole mode of being : scrappy , prepared , independent , extroverted . Europe ’ s front door , he told u , wa positioned to feed traveler directly into exploitation : overpriced cafe , trinket shop , long line , corporate high-rise hotel . The back door , by contrast , led to revelation . He showed u impossibly enticing photo : cobblestone piazza teeming with fruit stall , quirky wooden hotel among wildflower in the Alps , vast arsenal of multicolored cheese . He made travel seem le like a luxury than a necessary exploration of the self , a civic responsibility , a basic courtesy to your fellow human . It seemed almost unreasonable not to go . Above all , Steves told u , do not be afraid . The people of the world are wonderful , and the planet we share is spectacular . But the only way to really understand that is to go and see it for yourself . So go .
 My girlfriend and I left the room convert to the gospel of Rick Steves . We bought his book and highlighted it to near-meaninglessness . We started mapping itinerary , squirreling away money , asking relative for donation . ( In probably the worst phone call of my life , my rancher grandfather expressed shock and dismay that I would ask him to support this meaningless overseas lark . ) Eventually , over many month , we scraped together just enough to buy plane ticket and order minimalist Steves-approved supply , including a travel towel so thin and nonabsorbent that it seemed to just push the moisture around your skin until you forgot you were wet . We packed exactly a Steves taught u : T-shirts rolled into space-saving noodle , just enough clothes to get u from one hotel laundry session to the next . Then , for the first time in our life , we left North America .
 One of Steves ’ s strongest recommendation is to keep a journal . Mine wa so corny that it cover actually said “ A TRAVELER ’ S NOTEBOOK ” over a picture of the Eiffel Tower . When I opened it recently , the reality of that long-ago trip hissed out with fresh urgency . My 20-year-old self recorded everything . On our first day in Europe , we bought imported Austrian apple with fat , heavy English coin and saw a woman stumble on a staircase , breaking an entire bag of newly bought china . We arrived at our first hostel , the Y.M.C.A . in Bath , to find a man urinating in the stairwell — so we kept walking until we happened into a nearby churchyard , where the gravestone were so old and thin they were almost translucent . As we tried to make out the name of the dead , songbird sang strenuously in the tree all around u . This juxtaposition — old death , new life — blew my jet-lagged American mind . “ Already , after just one day in Bath , ” I wrote in my journal , “ the world ha grown firmer . Reality fill it gap . ”
 That , more or le , wa the theme of the trip . For six week , we followed the Steves game plan . We shared squalid bunk with other young traveler from Denmark , Australia , Canada and Japan . In the stately public park of Paris , we ate rotisserie chicken with our bare hand . One stifling afternoon at the Colosseum in Rome , we watched a worker slam his ladder against the edge of an arch and break off some ancient brick . ( He looked over at u , looked down at the brick , kicked dirt over them and kept working . ) We were moved by Van Gogh , Picasso and Gaudí , but unmoved by Versailles ( “ more vain than beautiful , ” I wrote ) , bullfighting ( “ more brutal than artful ” ) and Goya ( “ vague and blurry ” ) . Once , I left my underwear on a Mediterranean beach overnight and , since I could not afford to lose a pair , had to go back and pick it up the next day , in full view of all the sunbather .
 Wherever we went , Rick Steves wa with u . In my journal , I referred to him half-jokingly a our “ worldly uncle and guiding light , ” and a we walked around , I annoyed my girlfriend by doing impression of him . We seemed to have entered the world of his slide : the fruit market and overnight train , the sunny French river under the ancient Roman aqueduct . Sometimes our European host , with the quiet pride of someone who once met Elvis , told u story about Steves . He wa a gentleman , they said , a truly good man , and he always came in person to check out their hotel , and he never failed to ask them how their child were doing .
 By the end of our trip , we were completely broke . We couldn ’ t afford even a baguette on our last day in Paris . We flew home looking ragged , shaggy , weather-beaten and exhausted .


 But of course Steves wa right : Our life were never the same . We were still young Americans , but we felt liberated and empowered , like true citizen of the world . The most important thing we learned all had to do with home . As the English writer G.K. Chesterton once put it , in a quote I found printed in my corny old travel journal : “ The whole object of travel is not to set foot on foreign land ; it is at last to set foot on one ’ s own country a a foreign land. ” After looking at a Roman stone wall topped by a Saxon stone wall topped by a medieval English wall next to a modern paved street , I began to see what a thin crust of national history the United States actually stand on . I began to realize how silly and narrow our notion of exceptionalism is — this impulse to consider ourselves somehow immune to the force that shape the rest of the world . The environment I grew up in , with it mall and freeway , it fantasy of heroic individualism , began to seem unnatural . I started to sense how much reality exists elsewhere in the world — not just in a theoretical sense , in book and movie , but with the full urgent weight of the real . And not just in Europe but on every other continent , all the time , forever . I began to realize how much I still had to learn before I could pretend to understand anything . Not everyone need Steves ’ s help to get to this point . Some people get there themselves , or their community help them . But I needed him , and I am eternally glad I wa dragged that day to see him talk .
 [ How to eat in Venice like a Venetian . ]
 Steves answered his front door slightly distracted . I had come in the middle of his breakfast preparation . He wa stirring a block of frozen orange juice into a pitcher of water . “ Freshly squeezed from the can ! ” he quipped . This wa April 2018 , exactly 20 year after my first trip to Europe . I had come to see Steves in the most exotic place possible : his home . He life just north of Seattle , in a town so rainy it ha a free umbrella-share program . There is nothing particularly exotic about the house itself . It ha beige carpeting , professionally trimmed shrub and a back deck with a hot tub . What wa exotic wa simply that Steves wa there . He had just returned from his frenetic speaking tour of the United States and would be leaving almost immediately on his annual trip to Europe . For now , he wa making breakfast : frozen blueberry , Kashi cereal , O.J . “ I would eat this every day for the rest of my life if I could , ” he said .
 But of course , he could not . Steves is gone too much , yo-yoing between the misty forest of the Pacific Northwest and the sun-baked cathedral of Europe . Every year , no matter what else is going on , Steves spends at least four month practicing the kind of travel he ha preached for 40-odd year : hauling his backpack up narrow staircase in cheap hotel , washing his clothes in sink , improvising picnic .
 He is now 63 , and he could afford to retire many time over . But he doesn ’ t have the metabolism for sitting around . Among his colleague , Steves is a notorious workaholic . After grueling day of filming in Europe , he ha been known to slip script revision under the crew ’ s door at 2 a.m. , and then to ask them , at breakfast , for their feedback . On long car ride , he sits in the back seat and type op-eds on his laptop . His relentless hands-on control of every aspect of his business is what ha distinguished the Rick Steves brand .
 It is also , obviously , exhausting — if not for Steves , then at least for the people around him . He ha two child , now grown , and for much of their childhood , Steves wa gone . He wa building his company , changing the world . For very long stretch , his wife wa forced to be a single mother . ( She and Steves divorced in 2010 after 25 year of marriage . ) Every summer , when the family joined Steves in Europe , his pace hardly slackened : They would cover major city in 48 hour , blitzing through huge museum back to back . The kid complained so much , on one trip , that Steves finally snapped — if they were so miserable , he said , they could just go sit in the hotel room all day and play video game . They remember this day a heaven . One year , while Steves wa away , the child converted to Catholicism . His son , Andy Steves , eventually went into the family business : He now work a a tour guide and even published a European guidebook .
 Steves is fully aware that his obsessive work ethic is unusual . He admits that he ha regret . But he can not make himself stop . He ha the fervor of the true evangelist : The more people he meet , the more city he visit , the more life he might change . At one point , a we talked , he pulled out the itinerary for his coming trip — from Sicily to Iceland , with no down time whatsoever . Just looking at it made him giddy . I asked why he couldn ’ t ease up slightly — maybe just spend two month in Europe , maybe just speak in 10 American city .
 “ It ’ s a strange thing , ” he said . “ I get energy from it . It ’ s like I ’ m breathing straight oxygen . What would I do if I stayed home ? Not much . Nothing I would remember . ”
 In his house , Steves offered up a little show and tell . He pointed out an antique silver cigarette lighter shaped like the Space Needle . He sat down at his baby grand piano and lost himself , for a few happy minute , playing Scarlatti . He took me to a room filled with book and reached up to a very high shelf . “ I don ’ t show this to too many people , ” he said , “ because they ’ ll think I ’ m nuts. ” Steves pulled down a thick red binder , the content of which were , indeed , pretty nutty . When Steves wa 13 , he decided , for no apparent reason , to conduct a deep statistical analysis of the 1968 Billboard pop chart . Every week , he would clip the ranking out of his local newspaper and , using a point system of his own devising , graph the top band ’ success on sheet of gridded paper . The line were multicolored and interwoven — it looked like the subway map of some fantastical foreign city . You could see , at a glance , the rising and falling fortune of the Beatles ( red ) and Creedence Clearwater Revival ( black ) and Elvis Presley ( dot and dash ) . Steves kept this up for three year , taping together many piece of graph paper , and in the end he summarized the data in an authoritative-looking table that he typed on the family typewriter . This is what wa in that binder : a systematic breakdown of the most successful band from 1968 to 1970 , a determined by the objective statistic of an analytical adolescent weirdo . ( The winner , of course , were the Beatles — 1,739 point — followed by Creedence , Simon and Garfunkel , Neil Diamond . )
 Steves laughed . It wa ridiculous . But it wa also a perfect window into his mind . Even at 13 , a powerful energy wa coiled inside him — an unusual combination of obsession and precision , just waiting for some worthwhile project to burst out in .
 And that , coincidentally , wa exactly when he found it : the project of his life . In the summer of 1969 , when Steves wa 14 , his parent took him to Europe . They owned a business tuning and importing piano , and they wanted to see factory firsthand . Steves approached this first trip abroad with the same meticulous energy he brought to his Billboard graph . As he traveled around the continent , he recorded the essential data of his journey on the back of postcard : location , activity , weather , expense . One day , Steves spent 40 cent on fishing gear . Another , he met a 79-year-old man who had witnessed the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand . To keep everything in order , Steves numbered the postcard sequentially . He still ha them all packed lovingly into an old wooden box .
 On that same formative trip , the Steves family visited relative in Norway . They happened to be there in July 1969 , when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon . “ Ett lite skritt for et menneske , ” the television said , “ ett stort sprang for menneskeheten. ” In that moment , in that strange place , young Rick Steves felt the concept of “ menneskeheten ” — “ mankind ” — at a depth he never would have been able to access back home . Europe wa a crash course in cultural relativity . In a park in Oslo , he had an epiphany : The foreign human around him , he realized , were leading existence every bit a rich and full a his own . “ Right there , ” he would write later , “ my 14-year-old egocentric worldview took a huge hit. ” A life-changing realization clicked into place . “ This planet must be home to billion of equally lovable child of God . ”
 That first trip set the course for everything that followed . When Steves wa 18 , he went back to Europe without his parent . Soon , life in America became a series of interlude between travel . He taught piano to earn money , then stretched that money a far a he possibly could , sleeping on church pew and park bench , in empty barn and construction zone , from Western Europe to Afghanistan . He turned his cheapness into a science . Instead of paying for a hotel room in a city , Steves would use his Railpass and sleep on a train for the night — four hour out , four hour back . He would stuff himself on free breakfast bread , then try to eat a little a possible for the rest of the day . Naturally , he recorded all this , and today he ha an impressive archive of old travel journal . Their page preserve , in tiny handwriting , shadowy young dissident in Moscow , diarrhea in Bulgaria , revolution in Nicaragua .
 In his 20 , Steves brought his wide-roaming wisdom back to the United States . He started to supplement his piano teaching with travel seminar . His signature class , European Travel Cheap , ran for six hour . Steves could have talked longer than that , but it struck him a impractical for his student . In Europe , he rented a nine-seat minibus and started to lead small tour . Eventually , his seminar and tour note morphed into his book . The first edition of “ Europe Through the Back Door , ” published in 1980 , wa typed on a rented IBM Selectric . It had no ISBN and looked so amateurish that bookstore assumed it wa an early review copy . “ Anyone caught reprinting any material herein for any purpose whatsoever will be thanked profusely , ” it said . This wa the birth of the Rick Steves empire .
 Rick Steves both is and is not his TV persona . Offscreen , he allows himself to be much more explicitly political . He ha the passion of the autodidact . Growing up , Steves led a relatively sheltered existence : He wa a white , comfortable , middle-class baby boomer in a white , comfortable , middle-class pocket of America . Travel did for him what he promise it will do for everyone else : It put him in contact with other reality . He saw desperate poverty in Iran and became obsessed with economic injustice . He started searching for answer in book , scribbling note in the margin of “ Bread for the World , ” by Arthur Simon , and “ The Origins of Totalitarianism , ” by Hannah Arendt . He studied the war industry and colonial exploitation . The first time Steves traveled to Central America , he came back so outraged that he wrote a fiery tract called “ There ’ s Blood on Your Banana , ” then flew to Washington and hand-delivered a copy to the office of every member of Congress .
 In the early day , Steves injected political lesson into his European tour . Sometimes he would arrive in a city with no hotel reservation , just to make his privileged customer feel the anxiety of homelessness . In Munich , he would set up camp in an infamous hippie circus tent , among all the countercultural wanderer of Europe .
 Today , Steves is more strategic . His most powerful tool , he realizes , is his broad appeal . He ha an uncanny knack for making serious criticism feel gentle and friendly . Often he disguise critique of America with a rhetorical move that I like to think of a “ U.S.A. ! U.S.A. ! U.S.A. ! ( But . ... ) ” “ I ’ m unapologetically proud to be an American , ” he writes in the introduction to his book “ Travel a a Political Act. ” “ The happiest day of any trip is the day I come home . ... But other nation have some pretty good idea too . ”
 That ’ s when he hit his audience with legal prostitution , high tax rate and universal health care .
 When I asked Steves about this strategy , he chuckled .
 “ It ’ s not America-bashing , ” he said . “ It ’ s America-loving . I think it ’ s loving America to look at it critically . But you ’ ve got to set it up . You ’ ve got to allay people ’ s concern that you ’ re a communist . So you explain to them : I ’ m a capitalist , I make a lot of money , I employ a lot of people , I love the law of supply and demand . It seems kind of silly , but you ’ ve got to say that . Then , especially the husband who are dragged there by their wife , they go , ‘ I thought he wa a commie , but he ’ s O.K. ’ And then you don ’ t need to be too gentle . You can confront people with a different perspective , and you ’ ll get through . ”
 Steves learned this strategy , he said , from his early day running tour , living with the same people for week at a time . Survival required being pleasant . People didn ’ t want grating lecture about America ’ s shortcoming — even if that wa sometimes his instinct . Instead , he pointed out different perspective with a smile . He became fluent in the need of American tourist . “ I know what their button are , ” he said . “ I know what their attention span is . I don ’ t want to just preach to the choir . I want to preach to organization that need to hear this , so I need to compromise a little bit so the gatekeeper let it through to their world . ”
 This balancing act ha become increasingly difficult over the past two decade , in a world of terrorism , war , nationalism and metastasizing partisanship . After the Sept. 11 attack , most travel company anticipated that the bottom wa about to fall out of the market . They canceled tour and cut back budget . Steves , however , remained defiantly optimistic . He promised his staff that there would be no cut , no layoff and no shift in message . He insisted that a world in crisis needed travel more , not le . Soon the shock of Sept. 11 turned into the Iraq war , which strained the relationship between the United States and even it closest European ally , sending the travel industry deeper into it trough . In his hometown , Steves caused a controversy when he walked around removing row of American flag that had been set up in support of the war . It wa , he argued , an act of patriotism : The flag is meant to represent all Americans , not just war supporter . “ I wa shark-bait on Seattle ’ s right-wing radio talk show for several day , ” he wrote .
 Lately , Steves concedes , his political message ha begun to take over his teaching . In “ Travel a a Political Act , ” the familiar element of his guidebook — walking tour , museum guide , hotel review — are replaced by rabble-rousing cultural critique . Steves express deep admiration for Scandinavian-style social democracy and call out many of America ’ s fault : our addiction to car and gun and mass incarceration ; our deference to corporation ; our long history of cultural imperialism ( “ one of the ugliest thing one nation can do is write another nation ’ s textbook ” ) . Some moment in the book verge on un-American . “ Sometimes , when I ’ m frustrated with the impact of American foreign policy on the developing world , ” Steves writes , “ I have this feeling that an impotent America is better for the world than an America whose power isn ’ t always used for good . ”
 Occasionally , despite his best effort , Steves still ruffle feather . Recent TV special have covered Iran — “ I believe if you ’ re going to bomb a place , ” Steves ha written , “ you should know it people first ” — and the rise of fascism in Europe . In a special about the Holy Land , Steves refers unapologetically to “ Palestine ” instead of “ the West Bank ” or “ Palestinian territory ” ; some viewer were so outraged that they told Steves they were removing PBS from their will . After one recent speech in the Deep South , event organizer refused to pay Steves — their conservative sponsor , he learned , considered his message a form of liberal propaganda .
 In recent year , Steves ha become a happy warrior for an unlikely cause : the legalization of marijuana . He first tried the drug in Afghanistan , in the 1970s , in the name of cultural immersion , and he wa fascinated by it effect on his mind . Today , he is a board member of Norml , the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws , and a regular speaker at Hempfest . In his headquarters you will find a poster of the Mona Lisa holding a gargantuan spliff . In 2012 , Steves campaigned hard for Washington State ’ s successful legalization initiative , and since then he ha barnstormed other state ( Oregon , Maine , Vermont and more ) to make sure the civil liberty are properly passed around . On a shelf in his living room , right there among all the European knickknack , Steves display a sizable bong .
 Sometimes , fan urge Steves to run for office . When I asked him if he would ever get into politics , he had an answer ready : “ I already am. ” Good travel teaching , in his eye , is inherently political . To stay in a family-owned hotel in Bulgaria is to strengthen global democracy ; to pack light is to break the iron logic of consumerism ; to ride a train across Europe is to challenge the fossil-fuel industry . Travel , to Steves , is not some frivolous luxury — it is an engine for improving humankind , for connecting people and removing their prejudice , for knocking distant culture together to make unlikely spark of joy and insight . Given that million of people have encountered the work of Steves over the last 40 year , on TV or online or in his guidebook , and that they have carried those lesson to untold other million of people , it is fair to say that his life ’ s work ha had a real effect on the collective life of our planet . When people tell Steves to stay out of politics , to stick to travel , he can only laugh .
 “ It ’ s flattering to think I could run for office , ” he admitted . “ And it would be exciting . But I think I ’ m accomplishing more right now than I would in office , and I ’ m having more fun . I ’ m skiing with beautiful wax on my ski . When I want to do something , I can do it . ”
 Steves is deeply indifferent to creature comfort . When I visited him , the back seat of his car wa covered with a greenish slime , practically disintegrating , because of a mysterious leak . He just cracked the window to try to dry it out . Steves prefers to spend his money on his favorite cause . His activism can be quirky and impulsive . In 2011 , after hearing that his local symphony orchestra wa struggling , he stepped in with a gift of $ 1 million , spread over 10 year , to help keep it operating . ( This , pointedly , wa how much money he would get back from President George W. Bush ’ s tax cut over a decade . ) Last year , during a chat with one of the national leader of the Lutheran Church , Steves wondered how much it would cost to send every single Lutheran congregation in the United States a DVD of his recent TV special about Martin Luther . It wa something like $ 30,000 ; Steves happily wrote the check . In the 1990s , working in partnership with the Y.W.C.A. , he started investing his retirement saving in local real estate in order to house homeless mother and their child . The plan wa to take that money out of the banking system and let it do a few decade of social good , at which point Steves could sell the building to fund his retirement . Eventually he worked his way up to buying a whole 24-unit apartment complex — and then he donated it outright to the Y.W.C.A . The mother , he said , needed it more than he would .
 Steves is obsessed with the problem of poverty and amazed at our perpetual misunderstanding of it . “ It ’ s not just : You screwed up , so you ’ re poor , ” he said . “ There ’ s a structure that keep half of humanity poor . This need to be talked about . I can do it , and I can get away with it. ” His next TV special , in production now , will investigate extreme poverty and hunger through two very different non-European country : Guatemala and Ethiopia . In the meantime , all the royalty of his latest book — an updated edition of “ Travel a a Political Act ” — are being donated to Bread for the World , an organization that lobby on behalf of hungry people . He is working on making his company ’ s tour completely carbon-neutral .
 “ If I wa trying to build a career on the speaking circuit — if I wa struggling , and I needed these gig — I would not talk about that stuff , ” he said . “ I could just talk about light stuff , and everybody would love it . But I ’ m not working right now to do that . I ’ m not trying to get anywhere that I ’ m not already . I don ’ t need to be anything I ’ m not . I ’ m 63 year old . I could retire now . But I ’ m ramping up . ”
 Indeed , Steves ’ s business ha been booming . Once the travel market finally recovered , some year after Sept. 11 , Steves occupied a disproportionately big share of it — precisely because he had refused to scale back . By taking a principled stand , Steves flourished . Today , his chipper voice is reaching more Americans than ever . “ Fear , ” a Steves like to say , “ is for people who don ’ t get out very much . ”
 [ 4 stop for a woman-focused trip to Seoul . ]
 One night , in his living room , Steves pulled out a plain black notebook . “ Here ’ s something you might find interesting , ” he said with his trademark cheer , and he flipped open to a random page and prepared to read aloud . I wa familiar , by then , with Steves ’ s deep archive of old travel journal , and so I settled in to listen to further adventure from 1975 Moscow or 1997 Paris . This , however , wa something else entirely — a record of a very different kind of journey .
 “ Getting high , ” Steves read , “ release the human in me . ”
 “ Intelligence is a rubber band , ” he continued . “ Getting high is stretching it . ”
 I wa sitting in the beige living room of America ’ s foremost travel guru , underneath framed reproduction of popular European masterworks , and my mind wa about to be well and truly blown . For the next 20 minute , Steves would read me koan about the glory of being stoned .
 “ High is the present , ” he read .
 “ When you ’ re high , you debate long and hard over whether to put on your sweater or turn up the heat . ”
 This journal , Steves explained , contained what he called his “ High Notes. ” For nearly 40 year , he had been writing in it exclusively after smoking marijuana . He would get baked , open up to somewhere in the middle and jot down whatever he happened to be thinking — deep or shallow , silly or angry . There is no chronology ; on every page , axiom from many different decade commingle . It is a lifelong treasury of Steves ’ s stoner thought .
 He continued to read .
 “ As soon a I stop mattering so much , I ’ ll be happier . ”
 “ A baby doesn ’ t know if the hanging is on the wall or if the wall is on the hanging . ”
 “ Make a rug with vacuum mark , so it always look freshly vacuumed . ”
 The entry covered an impressively wide territory . Some were little shred of oracular poetry ( “ We all have a divine harness ” ) , while others were dashed-off semi-witticisms ( “ Wolfgang von Bewildered ” ) or bitter social critique ( “ The spiritual cesspool of America — our shopping mall ” ) . “ They don ’ t let you into heaven without callus on your soul , ” he read at one point . “ Suffer or weep. ” There were scrap of humorous dialogue ( “ ‘ Nothing is wrong with an ego ! ’ he bellowed ” ) and sentence that would have made great bumper sticker on rusting VW bus : “ I ’ d like to be quarantined from reality . ”
 I found myself wondering , for the thousandth time : Who doe this ? What kind of mind not only think of such a project but actually follows through with it , decade after decade after decade ? Who , for God ’ s sake , is this disciplined when they ’ re high ?
 As Steves read , he interrupted himself again and again with great shouting honk of laughter , and I cackled right along with him . Then , suddenly , with almost no transition , we would find ourselves deep in earnest conversation about the nature of true happiness or the danger of ambition . And then we would suddenly be cackling again . We were , in other word , getting high on Steves ’ s “ High Notes . ”
 He kept reading .
 “ I ’ ve been craning my mind to see you , ” he said .
 “ I feel like a hungry bird , but I won ’ t eat any worm I don ’ t like . ”
 Steves showed me complex analytical graph about true love and divorce rate , about the way music sound when you ’ re high versus sober , about the degree of honesty possible with the various people in your life . ( “ Scale of Unconditional Regard , ” this last one wa called . ) One page of the journal had a strand of hair taped to it , labeled “ split end. ” There wa a drawing of a woman ’ s breast . And of course there were many , many more description of getting high itself . “ Getting high is like roasting an English muffin , ” Steves read . “ You start out cold and doughy , and you toast it to a crisp brown , and just a little more and you get all black and burned . ”
 At some point , he looked up from the journal . “ To me , ” he said , “ this is a precious thing . Because this is me . ”
 He kept reading .
 “ Time spent socially is time spent at the expense of personal betterment , ” he said .
 He shook his head . That ’ s how he had thought when he wa young . “ That ’ s my problem , ” he added ruefully . “ I work all the time . ”
 Then he kept reading .
 “ When I die , ” he read , “ scatter me all over the budget hotel of Europe . ”

 When my wife and I were married , my mother-in-law told u she had a special gift for u . I wasn ’ t sure what to expect . She didn ’ t tell u what the gift wa , but she did tell u where it wa . In Sweden , on an island , in the forest .
 As with all magical place , getting to the island in Sweden requires some effort ( particularly a my wife , son and I live in Los Angeles ) . After the plane , the train and a car ride to the countryside , a boat ferry u across the lake from the mainland . There are only a handful of cottage — with no electricity or running water — on the island . It hasn ’ t been developed ( and , I hope , never will be ) . The forest service long ago gave over the island ’ s forest management to nature , so the place is thick with tree : gangly evergreen and white birch , a well a wildflower , blueberry plant and many others . The island is only about 50 acre , but it ’ s quite easy to get lost . Distances walking in the forest are hard to determine . You spend so much time walking over , under and around branch , brush and fallen tree that a simple hike can quickly become a disorienting journey . There are no straight line in a forest .
 In Sweden , mushroom are like gold . Specifically chanterelle mushroom . Aside from their high cost and their subtle earthy flavor ( cooked in butter and served on toast ) , their value is enhanced by how late in the season they grow . So Swedes are extremely protective of their chanterelle patch . And though the custom of allemansratten ( “ freedom to roam ” ) allows everyone access to walk and forage on all land , when a patch is discovered deep in the forest , people sometimes record the GPS coordinate and pas them down like a closely guarded secret .

You spend so much time walking over , under and around branch , brush and fallen tree that a simple hike can quickly become a disorienting journey . There are no straight line in a forest .
 In Sweden , mushroom are like gold . Specifically chanterelle mushroom . Aside from their high cost and their subtle earthy flavor ( cooked in butter and served on toast ) , their value is enhanced by how late in the season they grow . So Swedes are extremely protective of their chanterelle patch . And though the custom of allemansratten ( “ freedom to roam ” ) allows everyone access to walk and forage on all land , when a patch is discovered deep in the forest , people sometimes record the GPS coordinate and pas them down like a closely guarded secret .
 The day my mother-in-law took u for our first walk , everything seemed slow and quiet ( besides the buzz of the mosquito ) . I listened to her tell story of playing here a a child ; exploring it made me feel young , and nostalgic for a past I had never lived . I marched behind my wife and wa careful when stepping over fallen tree or catching branch she bent back to allow me to pas . I noticed too that color were brighter — particularly the striking golden-yellow chanterelle , whose unusual billowing shape sometimes reminded me of linen blowing on a clothesline or tiny version of Marilyn Monroe ’ s dress in “ The Seven Year Itch. ” Once I reoriented myself to searching like this , it became sport to find them . Some mushroom you can eat , and some can make you very sick . Animals know this , and people who spend lot of time in the forest know this . My mother-in-law know .
 I wasn ’ t sure how far we had walked , and I would not even have seen the path if it weren ’ t for my mother-in-law ’ s pointing it out . She took u to a clearing among some tree , looked around a bit , then stopped and bent down . She carefully pulled back some leaf and brush and said , “ This is for you. ” It wa a small patch of chanterelle mushroom : a cluster of about five or six undulating golden nugget jutting out of the dark , wet ground . She said she had given each of her child a patch in the forest where she found that mushroom consistently grew each year . “ Some year the animal get to them first , ” she said , “ but we ’ re lucky this year . ”
 It ’ s winter now , and we are back in Los Angeles . But I find myself thinking a lot about my mother-in-law ’ s gava , her gift — our tiny plot of mushroom . The quiet of the forest , maybe it ’ s snowing , maybe it ’ s dark . It ’ s strangely comforting to think of something so small and delicate and so far away — our small space alone on it island where we will return year after year .

 A weeklong trip in Alaska wa supposed to be an adventure . In an instant , it became the experience that defined u all .
 By JON MOOALLEM
 DAVID BENJAMIN SHERRY
 The whale sighting happened right away , minute into Day 1 . Jon , Dave and I had just been dropped off on a remote Alaskan shoreline , an hour and a half by boat from the closest speck of a town . Jon wa working a a sea-kayaking guide that summer in Glacier Bay National Park , and he had invited u up for a seven-day excursion during his week off . As the boat that delivered u vanished , the drone of it engine dampening into a murmur and then finally trailing off , it became unthinkably quiet on the beach , and the largeness and strangeness of our surroundings were suddenly apparent . It wa a familiar phenomenon for Jon from the start of all his trip : a moment that people instinctually paused to soak in . To me , it felt like those scene of astronaut who , having finally rattled free of the earth ’ s atmosphere , slip into the stillness of space . Except we weren ’ t in space . We were on earth — finally , really on earth .
 We were only starting to move around again , packing our gear into the kayak , when we heard the first huff of a blowhole , not far offshore .
 Jon wa ecstatic . It seemed to him a if the animal were putting on a show , swimming playfully in the kelp , diving , resurfacing , then plowing it open mouth across the surface to feed . He took it a a good omen . Though I had no idea at the time , he wa anxious that Dave and I might feel intimidated about making the trip ; such a big payoff , so quickly , would get u excited and defuse any apprehension .
 For Dave , the whale-sighting had exactly the opposite effect . Once , when he wa a kid , his dad took him scuba diving with dolphin . They were friendly , awe-inspiring creature , purportedly , but they terrified Dave instead . He could still conjure the feeling of hanging defenselessly in that water while the animal deftly swirled around him , le like solid object than flash of reflected light , while he could move only in comparative slow-motion . Ever since , he had harbored a fear of large sea creature — a niche phobia , particularly for a young man who lived in the Bronx , but a genuine one still . And so , even a Dave understood that a chance to see whale up close like this wa a major draw of a kayaking trip in Alaska , and though he feigned being thrilled , some second thought were kicking in : We were going out there , he realized .
 The whale left me exhilarated and gleeful , like Jon ; but deeper down , I also remember feeling shaken , like Dave . Nothing about the animal registered to me a playful or welcoming . It just appeared in the distance , then transited quickly past u , from left to right . My uneasiness had something to do with the whale ’ s great size and indifference — it obliviousness — a it passed . Watching it made me feel profoundly out of place and register how large that wilderness wa , relative to me .
 At the time , I wa working at a literary magazine in New York City called The Hudson Review , picking poem out of the slush pile and mailing them to an outside panel of editorial adviser . I wa trying hard in my letter to impress one of them : Hayden Carruth , a gruff and irreverent 81-year-old poet who lived far upstate . I loved Carruth ’ s work but wa more enamored with his persona : his yeoman life in the wood , his intolerance for phoniness and , most of all , the precision with which he articulated common suffering , including one strain of his own suffering that I related to , particularly in those year , but wouldn ’ t have had the courage , or clarity , to examine .
 “ I had always been aware , ” Carruth once wrote of his youth , “ that the Universe is sad ; everything in it , animate or inanimate , the wild creature , the stone , the star , wa enveloped in the great sadness , pervaded by it . ... Never then or now have I been able to look at a cloudless sky at night and see beauty there . A kind of grandeur , yes — but not beauty . The profusion and variety of celestial light have always frightened me . Why are they there ? Why these instead of others ? Why these instead of nothing ? ”
 That wa how I felt , watching the whale from the beach : afraid that everything wa accident . Then again , maybe it ’ s just hard to picture the start of the trip in retrospect without amplifying some feeling of foreboding . Something else Carruth wrote that ha always stuck with me : “ The wilderness begin at the edge of my body , at the edge of my consciousness , and extends to the edge of the universe , and it is filled with menace . ”

 It wa mid-August 2002 , and we were 23 , 24 and 25 . We had graduated from college together two year earlier . Dave , whom I also grew up with , shot out of undergrad knowing he wanted to be a doctor and had just finished his first year of medical school . Any similar momentum I had after graduation wa instantly sapped . Three night after I returned to my parent ’ house from school , I found myself driving my father to the emergency room . Three week after that , he died . My grief wa disorienting and total ; at a moment in life when everything is supposed to feel possible , making any single decision became impossible . I gave into that sadness for the better part of a year , resettling at home in New Jersey with my widowed mother and sliding back to the summer job I worked during school , glumly breaking down beef at a butcher shop two town over .
 I coped with my fatherlessness and confusion in way I ’ m not proud of and still don ’ t understand . I read a lot of book about Ronald Reagan , for example , even the collection of his love letter to Nancy . I also lashed out at Dave , who wa living at home that summer , too , studying for the MCAT . He withdrew awkwardly after the funeral , and I suppose I wa happy to hold that against him . It triggered some longstanding jealousy . A part of me always resented how he seemed unfairly exempt from the self-doubt and heaviness that I wa prone to .
 Jon , meanwhile , wa teaching at a rustic little boarding school in Switzerland , where his mother wa from . The summer after graduation , before starting the job , he set out for Alaska with a friend , sleeping in the bed of their old pickup . In the minuscule town of Gustavus , the gateway to Glacier Bay , he picked up seasonal work in the warehouse of a kayak-tour company . Jon had little actual experience of sea kayaking but had always felt drawn to the ocean in the abstract . In college , he and another friend plotted out a paddling expedition near Glacier Bay , across the border in Canada and applied for a grant from our school to fund it . The grant wa set up in memory of an alumnus who died in an avalanche while mountaineering . It wa meant to encourage the “ responsible and conscientious pursuit of wilderness expeditions. ” Safety wa key . But the committee rejected Jon and his partner ’ s application . They seemed insufficiently prepared .
 That wasn ’ t surprising . Jon grew up doing a lot of backcountry camping and wa a competent outdoorsman , but putting together a grant application required a kind of administrative fastidiousness he didn ’ t always posse . He wa bright but scatterbrained , forever picking up thing and putting them down , both figuratively ( music project , conversation ) but also literally . I can still picture him hustling around the house we shared in college , hunting for his key or his soldering iron , having gotten in over his head rewiring some device . He wa an artist ; one piece I remember consisted of a half-peeled banana , implanted with circuitry and suspended in a jar of formaldehyde . Once , he grew grass in our upstairs bathroom — a living bathmat , he said — until the turf became muddy and flooded the downstairs .
 This wa Jon ’ s third summer in Alaska , and he ’ d worked his way up to leading expedition , taking out vacationer for day at a time . Our trip , however , would venture beyond the typical circuit , into a remote corner of the park that he ’ d never been to . Jon had no serious concern about our safety , but he felt he bore responsibility for our emotional well-being . To enjoy ourselves , we would need to feel comfortable , not just in the wilderness but also with him a a leader .
 He suspected we wouldn ’ t trust him entirely . We didn ’ t . We knew him before he became a professional guide , and our perception of his expertise lagged behind the reality . “ With Jon , ” Dave told me , “ it wa always unclear to what extent he ’ d thought everything through. ” Dave remembered landing in Gustavus the night before we got underway and casually asking Jon a lot of question : Where are we going , exactly ? Do we have everything we need ? Jon seemed to have solid answer for all of them . As we headed back to his place for a good night ’ s sleep , he told u to wait in the yard . He wa living alone for the summer in a house that an acquaintance wa building in the wood . The structure wa framed-up but largely wall-less , and Jon , to be safe , needed to check that no moose had wandered in .
 After a spectacular first day of paddling , we came ashore on a rocky tidal flat about two mile from where we were dropped . Jon gave u his detailed tutorial about bear safety while we set up our campsite . He taught u , for example , to holler “ Hey , bear ! ” if we heard any rustling but also preventively , ahead of u , when we walked through the wood . The last thing you wanted wa to come across a brown bear unannounced .
 “ Hey , bear ! ” Jon kept hollering , by way of demonstration . He said it goofily , like a child ’ s TV host greeting some down-on-his-luck ursine neighbor at the doorway to their clubhouse . This wa intentional . Jon had noticed that the people on his trip often resisted bellowing “ Hey , bear ! ” into the wilderness . It wa essential for their safety , but it felt silly or vulnerable somehow , like singing in public . So he learned to turn it into a shtick , spinning it into a stream-of-consciousness narration : Hey , bear , I ’ m coming into the tree now . Hope you ’ re having a fantastic evening , Mr. Bear ! It loosened everyone up . They were performing for their friend now ; the whole group wa in on the joke .
 I had never seen a wild bear , though I have backpacked in bear country a handful of time . I felt comfortable with the animal in the abstract . But here , the bear weren ’ t abstract ; they breached the material plane . There were bear trail everywhere , leading from the tree line to the water , and disquietingly close , I felt , to where we were pitching our tent . We found heap of their scat . We saw tree where the animal had slashed off the bark to eat the inner layer , tuft of fur from their paw still plastered in the sap .
 I pretended I wa having fun . But that evening I grew increasingly petrified , almost delirious . My eye tightened , scanning for bear . The sound of the wind became bear , and so did the mossy stick cracking under our foot . I gave myself a migraine , then phased in and out of sleep .
 At sunrise , I woke feeling foolish . While Jon cooked pancake , I reasoned with myself , privately , in a notebook I brought on the trip . I tried to conceive of the situation a a geometry problem . Yes , some number of bear roved this landscape , I wrote : relatively tiny , independent blip , going about their business randomly , just like u . In all that empty space and confusion , a lethal collision of their moving blip and our moving blip would be an improbable coincidence . I ’ d been distorting those odds , mistaking myself for “ the absolute focus of all bear ’ attention , ” I wrote . It wa embarrassing , really . “ To be afraid of bear , ” I concluded , “ is to be narcissistic . ”
 I wa reminding myself that freakishly horrible thing are , by definition , unlikely to happen . Even now , my reasoning feel sound .
 [ Read about the search for a missing hiker in Joshua Tree ’ s wild interior . ]
 Day 2 wa a slog . We paddled through a spitting drizzle in an endless straight line , along the high granite wall of the coast . We talked le and le , just pushed through the emerald chop . Then eventually we gave up , hauling in our boat and making camp in a wide , crescent-shaped cove , short of the site that Jon originally picked out on his map .
 We had entered Dundas Bay , a rarely visited pocket of the national park that , I ’ ve since learned , ha a storied history a a hide-out for solitary misanthrope . In the 1930s , one prospector built a cabin not far from our campsite and brandished a gun at the Alaska Natives who passed through .
 We intuited that the scenery wa beautiful , but we could see very little of it through the fog . Our guidebook explained that “ the east side of the bay ” — where we were — “ can get extremely rough during foul weather , since large wave roll in ... and batter this shoreline. ” That wa happening now : The weather that plinked at u all afternoon wa roiling into a storm . Soon , the big rain started . We rushed through dinner , then loafed in our tent until , eventually , the loafing turned to sleep .
 A local newspaper would later describe the storm a “ short but intense. ” In Gustavus , a creek swelled to about a foot higher than it previous record . Gale wind , with gust up to 59 mile per hour , turned back two cruise ship in Skagway , about 85 mile north . Around 2 a.m. , we woke to discover the wind had shorn the rain fly off our tent . Jon ’ s sleeping bag and mine were soaked , while Dave wa snug and dry between u . We heard torrent of water lashing down and the wave crashing in the cove .
 We got up three or four hour later . The rain and wind no longer felt ferocious but were still too gnarly to paddle through ; there wa no question , Jon said , that we were staying put . We cooked breakfast and took turn playing chess in the tent . By late morning , the storm seemed to have passed . We were antsy . We figured we would take a look around .
 The terrain wa crammed with thicket of alder and spruce , underlain by fern and a furor of prickly thing . Jon pointed out devil ’ s club : three or four foot tall and leafy , armored up and down with spine . The plant pierced fleece and hurt like fire .
 There were no trail . We ’ d been trudging for some time when we reached a fast-moving stream , maybe 10 foot wide . Jon wa surprised ; it wasn ’ t on his map , most likely just a drainage bloated by the storm . We followed it downstream , looking for a way across , and eventually found it bridged by a hefty tree trunk . It seemed like an easy crossing . Jon stepped up and led the way , and Dave and I waited in a single-file line on the stream bank behind him . The creek wa loud , like a factory with all it gear and roller churning . Looking down , Jon realized there wa more water than he ’ d thought .
 That ’ s when I heard the snap in the wood behind me . After all my paranoia , I instantly understood that the many bear I ’ d thought I heard before were absolutely not bear — were nothing — because this sound wa so unmistakable and crisp , so explicitly something . I turned and hollered , “ Hey , bear ! ” then waited a beat . Maybe I said “ Hey , bear ! ” again ; I ’ m not sure . But I must have scanned those tree long enough to feel satisfied and safe , because I know I wa turning my head , to go back to my friend , when I saw the dark shape rushing forward in my peripheral vision .
 What I heard must have been root popping . If a tree is large enough , you can apparently hear them cracking underground like gunfire .
 The thud wa seismic . The trunk crashed down right next to me . Mapping out bit of evidence later , we concluded that the tree must have been about 80 foot tall and perhaps two foot in diameter . It wa some kind of conifer — a spruce or cedar . I screamed , involuntarily , “ Look out ! ” then watched Dave , a few step directly in front of me , dive sideways and hit the ground . When I got to him , he wa crouching , stunned but O.K . He looked up and said , “ Go get Jon . ”
 It hadn ’ t clicked back in for me : There were three of u . The sight of Dave going down had canceled out everything else . I scrambled out over the creek , running across the tree that had just fallen , shouting Jon ’ s name , then spotted him in the water , tangled in a snarl of sheared-off branch near the bank behind me — a cage , which kept him from hurtling downstream .
 He did not know he ’ d been hit by a falling tree . It had narrowly missed his head , struck his left shoulder , shearing it from his collarbone and breaking many of his rib . Later , a doctor would explain that the downward force had been so powerful that it had probably squashed Jon ’ s entire upper body , and all the organ inside , down toward his waist , momentarily compressing him like a bellow ; for a split second , his shoulder headed in the direction of his bellybutton , before his torso sprang up again .
 Jon had heard nothing , seen nothing . He wa turning around to help Dave onto the log — again , feeling responsible for our safety — and the next thing he knew , he wa in the water . He tried to reach out his left arm but could not make it move . He could not move his leg . He felt a bolt of pain down his spine .
 Jon later described flashing through an idiosyncratic sequence of thought , all in a few millisecond , a if watching a deck of card fanning across a table . One wa an image of himself in a wheelchair , sitting behind a mixing console in a fancy recording studio . “ I guess I can become a recording engineer in a wheelchair , ” he remembered thinking . He had never worked in a recording studio and , though he played music , he had no particular plan to . Still , this vision apparently felt like an acceptable future and freed him to resurface in the present . That wa when he registered me , screaming his name .
 Jon told himself he shouldn ’ t move . He knew from his many wilderness first-responder training that moving a person with spinal injury risk paralysis . Then again , he also knew that most of his body wa submerged in cold water , and he recognized that he risked dying of hypothermia if he didn ’ t move . “ If I ’ m already paralyzed , ” he concluded , “ I may a well move . ”
 He somehow hoisted himself out of the stream before Dave or I got to him , using his right arm and his chin and biting into something loamy with his teeth , for additional leverage . He reassessed the situation : better . Also : worse . He now realized that we were at least a mile inland from our camp .
 Suddenly , his body wa walking ; his leg just started working . Dave and I put him between u , supporting his frame . He wa moving faster than we expected , but uncoordinatedly . Then he crumpled between u . We tried again ; Jon wa dead weight . Dave noticed that his breathing wa shallow and his voice wa low — sign , Dave knew from med school , of a collapsed lung . He began battering Jon with a pep talk , telling him , firmly , that he had to get up , that we had to get out of here . Jon didn ’ t need that explained to him ; he wa cogent and still trying to plot our next step in his mind . He looked down to see why this log he wa resting on wa so lumpy and realized that he wa , in fact , sitting on his left arm . The arm wa slack , obviously broken ; his sleeve , pierced up and down with devil ’ s club . Jon had zero feeling in it . He found it amusing , this sensation of complete estrangement from one of his limb .
 Jon had been stressing that it wa important to stay together . But this wa another theory of wilderness survival that appeared to be breaking down in practice . Someone would have to get on the radio back at our camp . By chance , while marooned in our tent during the rainstorm the night before , Jon showed u how to use the device , though he did it almost a a formality ; the hand-held VHF unit wa merely a line-of-sight radio , he told u , meaning it range wa small , it signal too weak to pas through most obstacle . You were unlikely to reach anyone you couldn ’ t see , and we hadn ’ t seen anyone since a faraway fishing boat , early on Day 1 .
 There wa a moment of discussion , or maybe just an exchange of look between me and Dave . I told Dave he should go . I didn ’ t trust myself to find my way back . I also knew that I lacked the courage to try ; whether I wa being sensible or cowardly , I still don ’ t know . Besides , I took for granted that Dave would make it . He wa more capable in my mind , le likely to cinch himself in indecisive knot .
 Recently , though , Dave told me : “ You probably had no idea how much in my own head I wa . I know that you , growing up , definitely felt insecure about thing , and I think you looked at me and thought , Dave ha everything figured out . But I had so much anxiety. ” He brought up the tremor he used to have in his hand . I knew about it ; in high school , we waited table together , and I occasionally had to carry out Dave ’ s soup order , so he wouldn ’ t spill . But I guess I thought of the tremor a strictly physiological . I couldn ’ t see the vulnerability causing it .
 Now , a Dave sprinted away from me and Jon , swatting devil ’ s club from his path with the rubberized sleeve of his rain jacket , his nerve rose up and rattled him . He worried he wouldn ’ t be able to find the radio once he got back or know how to turn it on . What if he broke the radio , foreclosing whatever marginal chance we had of getting help ? There were lot of way to screw this up , Dave realized . More occurred to him a he ran .
 He found the radio . He turned it on . Then , having solved these problem , he encountered another he hadn ’ t anticipated : “ What is the appropriate thing you ’ re supposed to say ? ” he remembered thinking . On TV , you see a lot of people saying “ Mayday. ” And so , Dave faced the open water and started broadcasting into the fog : “ Mayday , Mayday. ” Even in that moment , though , alone on a beach in the middle of nowhere , he felt slightly self-conscious about it . This is so goddamn cliché , he thought .
 Back in the wood , kneeling over Jon , I wa having the same problem : I didn ’ t know what to say . He wa lying near a log on his injured side , his beard and glass flecked with dirt and tendril of moss . He seemed to be on the brink of losing consciousness . At no time would the possibility of Jon ’ s dying surface concretely in any of our mind . Still , I knew I wa supposed to keep talking to him , to tether him to the world with my voice somehow .
 I started vamping platitude : We were going to get out of here soon , and so forth . But I could feel myself treading water , even blundering , at one point , into a long-winded apology , worried I overstayed my welcome that one Christmas with his family . I wa afraid that the helplessness in my voice might be counterproductive , unsettling Jon instead of steadying him . It wa a tremendous silence to fill .
 What can a person say ? I had two literature professor in college who made u memorize poem . You never knew when some line of verse would come in handy , they claimed . One liked to brag that , while traveling through Ireland , he found that if he spat out some Yeats at a pub , he could drink free . This is how I wound up reciting a love poem to Jon .
 It wa “ The Shampoo , ” by Elizabeth Bishop , a lyric poem about the enormity of time , which turn startlingly intimate at the end , when Bishop offer to shampoo her lover ’ s silvering hair : “ Come , let me wash it in this big tin basin , /battered and shiny like the moon . ”
 After that , I imagine I also did some W.H . Auden ; I knew a fair amount of Auden back then . The stuff in rhyme and meter wa always easiest to memorize — “ Looking up at the star , I know quite well/That , for all they care , I can go to hell ” — which is why I had a lot of Robert Frost at my disposal a well : “ Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening , ” “ The Road Not Taken. ” For the most part , I trafficked in hit .
 Jon and I would spend about an hour and a half together alone on the forest floor . I ran through everything in my quiver — Kay Ryan , A.R . Ammons , Michael Donaghy — padding each poem with little prefatory remark , while Jon said nothing , just signaled with his eye or produced a sound whenever I checked in . I felt like a radio D.J . playing record in the middle of the night , unsure if anyone wa listening . And here ’ s one about owl by Richard Wilbur , I would tell Jon , and off we would go .
 I must have also done at least one by Hayden Carruth , my curmudgeonly pen pal at the literary magazine . Carruth ’ s poem didn ’ t lend themselves to memorization , but I ’ d worked hard to nail one of my favorite , in which he describes stopping to notice a deer standing in an apple thicket , then realizing the northern light are flaring overhead . Hayden and the animal pas a moment in stillness together . “ We are proud to be afraid , ” he writes , “ proud to share/the silent magnetic storm that destroys the stars. ” Relative to that boundless violence above them , he and the deer are momentarily allied , though still not entirely connected : “ a glimpse , an acknowledgment/it is enough and never enough . ”
 That ’ s what I said to my friend , powerlessly , tenting my jacket over his face when it started to rain . The title of the poem is : “ I Know , I Remember , But How Can I Help You . ”
 The Coast Guard cutter Mustang wasn ’ t where it wa supposed to be . The 110-foot patrol boat normally spent it time coursing through the Gulf of Alaska , inspecting halibut-fishing vessel , or circulating , a a terrorist deterrent , near the oil terminal at Valdez . It wa home-ported in Seward , hundred of mile from Glacier Bay . But the crew wa transiting to Juneau for a training when , a few day earlier , they were smacked by the same storm that later poured inland , over u . “ We had gotten absolutely pummeled , ” John Roberts , a petty officer on the Mustang , told me recently . For two day , the boat swished around in 15-foot-plus sea . Many on the crew had been hunkered in the mess deck , vomiting , while Roberts and a couple of his shipmate did their best to cover everyone ’ s watch . Finally , the Mustang slipped into Glacier Bay to find some protection . The weather started to ease . That afternoon , a Roberts piloted the Mustang east , toward Dundas Bay , his pallid crewmates were finally staggering back up to the bridge , asking where the hell they were .
 That wa when Dave ’ s Mayday call came through . The signal on the Mustang ’ s radio wa thin and faint , barely edging into range . Another of the ship ’ s petty officer , Eamon McCormack , explained to me that in retrospect the connection feel “ mind-boggling. ” Glacier Bay National Park extends over more than 5,000 square mile . Our signal would have covered two or three mile at most . And yet , a boat — a Coast Guard boat , no le — happened to be passing through that exceedingly small window at precisely the right time . “ I don ’ t know if , nine time out of 10 , you play that over again and the outcome would be the same , ” McCormack said . A moment earlier or later — second , potentially — and we might have slipped out of alignment . The moving boat would have cruised out of range , uncoupling from u forever .


 It wa 1:25 p.m. when the Mustang received Dave ’ s call , according to one of the subsequent Coast Guard report . Roberts couldn ’ t believe it . “ Come on , man , I ’ m tired , ” he said aloud , wearily , to the receiver in front of him . Roberts waited for a moment , per protocol , on the off chance that the Coast Guard ’ s central communication center in Juneau would pick up the call instead . Then he turned and asked his watch commander to pull out all the standardized search-and-rescue paperwork . He wa steeling himself , resummoning his professionalism . “ I guess we ’ re doing this , ” he said .
 Roberts wa the crew member on the Mustang with the most current medical training ; he would complete his E.M.T . certification the following month . As he started firing question at Dave on the radio , he didn ’ t like the answer that he heard coming back : the shallowness of Jon ’ s breathing , the likelihood of a punctured lung . More fundamental , Roberts remembered : “ Any time a tree fall on somebody , it ’ s not good. ” He wa also unsettled to learn that Dave and I both lived in New York City — a red flag , he had found , when someone wind up in trouble in the wilderness .
 We were 100 nautical mile from the nearest hospital ; a half-day trip , even in ideal condition . The Mustang requested that the Coast Guard Air Station in Sitka send a helicopter , but the immediate plan wa for Roberts and three crewmates to peel toward shore in the ship ’ s Zodiac and track u down . Dave had found the flare in Jon ’ s emergency kit and now , at 2:20 , with the Zodiac underway , the Coast Guard asked him to fire it . He wa still in front of our campsite , facing the water . He ’ d never shot off a flare before . He aimed straight up , then watched a the bright tracer rose and arced somewhere far behind him , deep in the wood . He wa uncertain whether this counted a a success . He started scanning the fog in front of him , but the Zodiac never appeared .
 Someone on the Mustang caught sight of the flare near the end of it arc and immediately directed the crew on the Zodiac toward it , steering them far away from Dave to the opposite side of the little peninsula we ’ d camped on . And yet , this wa lucky : they wound up coming ashore much closer to where I wa waiting in the wood with Jon . Soon , whatever poem I wa reciting wa interrupted by whistle blowing and voice calling , and eventually three shape , wearing hard hat and heavy orange rain gear , rushed toward u out of the tree .
 Roberts wa especially impressive , a reassuringly large Boston-area native with a booming voice . He knelt and took Jon ’ s vitals . The information wa troubling : his pulse wa 60 beat per minute ; his breathing , fast and shallow . They put his neck in a brace and eased him onto a kind of truncated backboard , called a Miller board , to move him out to the beach . Dave had returned by then . He and I crouched at one end of the board , near Jon ’ s foot , a someone — presumably Roberts — bellowed a count of three to lift .
 Later that night , lying down to sleep in a bed-and-breakfast in Gustavus — stunned and depleted , but dry and warm — Dave and I would talk and talk , reviewing the entire ordeal . We had drooped into a long silence , coasting toward sleep , when Dave spoke up with one last observation . When we were getting ready to lift Jon on the backboard , he said , it occurred to him that this wa one of those crisis moment you hear about , like when mother are suddenly able to lift a car off their baby . Dave expected we were going to have superhuman strength .
 We did not have superhuman strength . On Roberts ’ s command , the men raised Jon to waist height , swiftly and seemingly perfectly level , a though their arm and deltoid were hydraulic . Then , in one motion , they took off downhill , with negligible help from u . This can ’ t be accurate , but I remember the sensation of being almost dragged , like child in a sled .
 A National Geographic television crew wa embedded at the Coast Guard ’ s air station in Sitka , filming an installment of a thrill-ride reality series . The network had sent crew to other Coast Guard station around the country too , though this assignment appeared to hold the most dramatic potential . Air Station Sitka wa unique : Its pilot were responsible for 12,000 mile of coastline , a sprawling , treacherous wilderness riven with fjord , inlet and glacier , often buffeted by implacably horrible weather . People who went into the backcountry in Alaska had a way of getting themselves into a different magnitude of trouble , too ; a Roberts put it , “ When stuff happens in Alaska , it ’ s big. ” Still , this wa the television crew ’ s eighth day in Sitka , and a the show ’ s producer , Annabelle Hester , explained : “ I wa having call with my boss at headquarters saying , ‘ Nothing is happening ! ’ We were scrambling to come up with Plan B. ” Then , the Mustang ’ s call came in at 1:42 .
 “ What type of injury are we looking at ? ” asked the dispatcher . She wa taking the call from behind a semicircular counter , like the reception desk at a midlevel corporate branch office . She had a framed snapshot of a parakeet to brighten her work space , and a photograph of a dog with a heart that said , “ I Woof You. ” A cameraman stood conspicuously beside her , holding a tense , tight shot .
 “ Probable broken rib , a definite broken arm , ” said the man on the other end . Then his voice faltered , seemed to give up : “ And whatever else would happen to you if a tree fell on you , ” he added .
 The dispatcher retrieved the appropriate paperwork and scribbled “ Tree fell on person ” on one line . She read the current weather aloud : “ 30 knot wind , 300 ceiling , heavy rain and one-mile vis. ” That would soon be revised : the ceiling had dropped to 100 foot . Entering the weather condition on one of the Coast Guard incident report , someone would write , in a kind of nihilistic catchall : “ Extremely terrible . ”
 The Coast Guard ’ s policy wa to deploy a helicopter within 30 minute of the initial request , but the Air Station ’ s operation officer , Cmdr . Karl Baldessari , informed everyone that this mission would take longer to plan . Baldessari wa a 25-year veteran of the Coast Guard , a fast-moving , sinewy man in a blousy flight suit , with a tidy mustache and spiky hair . His role at the air station wa that of a firehouse chief . He wa responsible for the safety of everyone working there , which meant making judicious decision about what warranted sending them hurtling through the sky .
 That calculus got knotty in condition like these , though there wa a baseline volatility to flying in Alaska at all . The Coast Guard didn ’ t let it helicopter pilot fly lead out of Sitka , no matter how much experience they had at other air station , until they practiced difficult landing at specific location in the region and got their ego battered a little by logging a full winter in the state . Visibility in Alaska wa frequently poor ; condition changed quickly . One pilot told me about blindly tunneling through fog in the dark when his co-pilot got “ caged ” : The man lifted his eye momentarily from his instrument and , without any visual reference or a horizon to latch onto , found it impossible to reorient himself , lost all sense of direction and wa felled by vertigo .
 During much of the year it wa also cold enough , with sufficient moisture in the air , that ascending to clear the region ’ s many minor mountain or even just flying through a cloud risked the aircraft ’ s icing up . To mitigate this , the Coast Guard had laid out virtual “ track line ” across the entirety of their range : a grid of GPS point and a network of path connecting them , along which pilot could chart a course and fly at a relatively low altitude , confident they weren ’ t going to smash into a mountain . The system wasn ’ t comprehensive ; the track line got the pilot close to their destination , but ultimately they had to diverge from this GPS superhighway and fly the remaining distance the old-fashioned way , with their radar and eye . It wa like taking an exit off the interstate , except there might be a granite wall in front of you wherever you chose to get off . It wa possible the pilot would travel very far — a half-mile away from whoever needed their help — only to discover that the last leg wa too risky and be forced to turn back .
 Baldessari gathered the two pilot on duty that afternoon and the Air Station ’ s flight surgeon , then unrolled a large paper map . He pointed to our location , explaining : “ That ’ s probably one of the lousiest place we fly in and out of . This Inian Pass , right here , is the worst place we could possibly go . ”
 Inian Pass is a slim channel near the center of the Icy Strait , the long , interconnected system of waterway stretching through Glacier Bay . Conditions in the Icy Strait can be bad 300 day of the year , Baldessari recently told me ; wind , rain and storm surge all push through it fast from the open ocean . But Inian Pass is a narrow keyhole at the center of the strait — a mile-wide opening between a few uninhabited island and a rocky point — where all that weather speed up . The only way for the pilot to reach u would be to fly straight through it .
 Nothing in the National Geographic footage , at this point , feel reassuring . The flight surgeon hold his hand over his mouth and bite his lip . The co-pilot , Chris Ferguson , only a few month into his posting in Alaska , mill around and fidget with his ear . It ’ s obvious Baldessari need convincing . He wasn ’ t eager to send his men up if he didn ’ t have to and wasn ’ t certain they would make it all the way there if he did .
 “ It ’ s kind of funny , ” he told the pilot , pointing at the map . “ You ’ ve got a boat right here . ”
 Lying on his backboard like a burl of driftwood , Jon wa conscious and cognizant of his pain , but he had started to feel somehow buffered from his body , uninterested in connecting with the world beyond it . He would later describe himself a a “ thinking blob . It wa a very passive experience. ” He didn ’ t know what wa happening but could tell our momentum had stalled . He wa confused and felt impatient . In his mind , the three of u had solved the impossible problem : We ’ d managed to get help . This wa supposed to be the simple part , when everyone rushed him to the hospital . Instead , his condition deteriorated . Within 10 minute of reaching the beach , Jon threw up . I ’ d never seen anything like it , a kind of dark purple gristle . I took out my wool cap to wipe his face , and he retched a second time , straight into my hat .
 “ I got that all over me , ” John Roberts told me recently . He ’ d seen vomit like that before ; it meant Jon had ingested a fair amount of blood and signaled internal injury . It made Roberts anxious . He had been on the Mustang for two and a half year at that point but had spent the previous four year in Palm Beach , a busy but le extreme posting that often involved rescuing weekend boater from relatively close to shore — and where , Roberts pointed out , the water is warm and won ’ t necessarily kill you if you go in . Moreover , the bulk of the Coast Guard ’ s training is for maritime rescue , not rescue on land . Counterintuitive a it sound , Roberts ’ s comfort level and confidence had dropped significantly once he hopped off the Zodiac and set foot on the beach .
 He reported back to the Mustang that Jon had thrown up , then soon radioed again , explaining that Jon wa going into shock . He kept giving and requesting update , trying to gauge how long this might take , and eventually started erecting a makeshift shelter out of plastic sheeting and medical tape , hoping to keep Jon out of the rain . Out of earshot of u , Roberts explained to his crew mate Eamon McCormack what the vomit meant : The possibility of Jon dying , here under their care , wa real . At one point in the National Geographic footage , a Roberts ’ s call are relayed to the air station in Sitka , you can see where the dispatcher clearly writes on her form : “ E.M.T . doe not feel comfortable . ”
 By this time , the air station ’ s flight surgeon had received enough information to be alarmed . “ It sound like he ’ s got a pretty significant chest injury , ” he told Baldessari . Baldessari understood they would need to launch a helicopter but warned the Mustang that the aircraft might not make it through the weather ; ultimately it would be the pilot ’ call , once they veered off their last track line and tried to shoot through Inian Pass .
 They would go and give it a look , Baldessari explained over the radio , but the outlook wa iffy . The guy on the beach , he said , must be prepared to get Jon back on their cutter and haul him to a hospital themselves , a fast a they could .
 One evening this winter , my phone rang , and it wa Karl Baldessari . Long retired from the Coast Guard , he wa teaching aviation at a community college in Oregon , where I left a voice mail message earlier that day . I meanwhile had metamorphosed into a 40-year-old father of two and fumbled to explain to Baldessari that , a thrilled a I wa to have tracked him down , I wa , at the moment , racing to finish a risotto for my daughter before gymnastics practice and would have to call him back . Without missing a beat , Baldessari blared order at me , joking , but still sounding a instinctually in charge a he did in the National Geographic footage : “ O.K. , ” he said , “ you want to stir it constantly , but slowly ! ”
 I didn ’ t expect any of the Coast Guardsmen I wa cold-calling to remember that day . However dramatic it remained for me , I assumed it would have been obscured in a yearslong wash of more sensational incident . But everyone I spoke to did remember it , immediately and in detail . Baldessari had been involved in hundred of rescue operation during his 30-year career , and yet , a I stood at the stove on the phone that evening , he told me : “ The moment I listened to your voice mail , I knew exactly the case ! It wa almost like it wa yesterday . ”
 There wa something about the supreme freakishness of the accident that left a lasting impression . For those who came ashore , the experience wa also marked by a feeling of subtly escalating chaos and the pressure to surmount it . McCormack told me that ours wa a story he retold endlessly , often to the younger Coast Guardsmen he wa eventually tasked with training . In it wa a lesson about “ not taking situation that look impossible at face value , ” he said . “ When thing start to go wrong , don ’ t panic or lose sight of what resource you ’ ve got. ” Keep working the problem until it absolute end — even , McCormack added , if it mean deviating from official policy .


 McCormack wa not supposed to be landing an inflatable boat on an unforgivably rocky Alaskan shoreline , for example . But there he wa , anyway , beaching the Zodiac a gingerly a he could , so that Roberts and the other men could load Jon aboard . They slid him in on his side “ like a folder into a filing cabinet , ” a Jon put it , and started motoring through the chop , very cautiously , back to the Mustang , about a mile away .
 As relieved a Jon had been when the Coast Guard first arrived , he also felt instantaneously more vulnerable . Strapped to the back board , his neck in the collar , he surrendered control of his body , however imperfect that control had been . He wa being hauled around a an object now , with no ability to wriggle or shift position , to manage his pain or even to turn his head and see what wa happening . He wa helpless , entirely dependent on the upright people operating around him , those voice he could hear discussing him on the far side of some gauzy divide . About 10 minute into the trip on the Zodiac , Jon heard one of those voice say , “ Oh , shit , we ’ re losing air . ”
 A section of the Zodiac ’ s sponson — the inflatable fender that wrap around the boat — had punctured . One side wa completely deflated . “ It ’ s a big deal , ” McCormack recently explained to me , sounding surprised that I had to ask . The sponson increase the boat ’ s buoyancy and stability , a well a keeping water from cresting over the side ; under normal condition , a Zodiac with a broken sponson would have been taken out of service automatically . Instead , McCormack found the puncture and wedged the nozzle of a small pump inside . Then — steering the boat with one hand , operating the throttle with the other — he started working the pump with his foot , essentially doing leg press , to keep the fender partly inflated . The ride wa already bumpy in four-foot sea . Now McCormack began tracing a slow , zigzagging course , doing what he could to tamp down the turbulence and the violence to Jon ’ s spine , a well a to guard against the possibility of the injured man ’ s suddenly bounding over the side on his backboard .
 Roberts and the other Coast Guardsmen on the Zodiac leaned over Jon to shield him from the splash . The pain wa heinous ; Jon seemed to be passing out . Roberts talked to him , held his hand . Roberts felt crushed , he told me ; he wa torturing this guy in order to save him . When they finally reached the Mustang , rather than hoist Jon off the Zodiac , they swung the ship ’ s crane around and simply lifted the entire boat out of the water , level with the deck , and then carried him aboard , to keep from joggling him any more .
 McCormack eventually returned for me and Dave , and a half-hour later we were reunited with Jon in the Mustang ’ s athwartship passageway , a cramped , steel hallway , like the space between two car of a train . Jon wa still battened to the backboard , wedged up to keep the weight of his body on his less-painful side . They had cut off his clothes , though he ’ d murmured a plea not to — he wa wearing a brand-new Patagonia jacket that he had borrowed from a friend — then swaddled him in a hypothermia blanket . Dave and I knelt and rubbed his foot .
 The helicopter wa going to make it . I don ’ t remember there being a grand announcement . I ’ m not sure we were ever made aware of the possibility that it wouldn ’ t . Now the crew got busy below : tying down anything that could be blown off by the rotor wash or stashing it in the mess . I also don ’ t remember hearing the helicopter when it finally arrived . Instead , I remember only a heavy door to our left swinging open to reveal , like a scene from an action movie , the silhouette of a man in a blue flight suit , foot planted shoulder-width apart to steady himself a the ship rocked sideways . The cable he ’ d been lowered on drew back into the ocean spray and fog behind him . “ I ’ m flight surgeon Russ Bowman , ” he said and stepped inside .
 Bowman took Jon ’ s vitals and gave him several , successive shot of morphine . Soon , everyone wa working to squeeze him back through the narrow doorway and onto the deck where the helicopter , an MH-60 Jayhawk , wa idling overhead .
 Until recently , the story I told about the accident unfolded in two basic act : the tree fell , instantaneously unleashing a kind of unfathomable chaos ; then the Coast Guard appeared and , just a swiftly , regathered that chaos into order . It wa like watching footage of an exploding object , then watching it run in reverse . The maneuver the Coast Guard wa readying to execute now , on the deck of the Mustang , would be the climax of that progression .
 The helicopter hovered 30 or 40 foot over the boat , mirroring it speed and trajectory , while both vehicle moved slowly forward . “ Looks like you ’ re heading for a rain squall , ” the co-pilot , Chris Ferguson , radioed the Mustang at one point , and asked the ship to adjust it course , to keep them in a forgiving weather a possible . Soon the flight mechanic wa calling out instruction to tuck the aircraft into alignment : “ Forward and right 30 . Forward and right 20 . Forward and right 10. ” Then , finally — speaking , in the flight recording , with an almost galling air of imperturbability — the lead helicopter pilot , Rich McIntyre , radioed the flight mechanic to begin the hoist .
 The whole procedure , from our vantage point , seemed seamless and routine . In a way , it wa : After the agonized deliberation at the air station , the pilot exited off their GPS route into fairly manageable condition around Inian Pass . The wind were workable ; the water wasn ’ t excessively choppy . Ultimately , scooping Jon off the deck of the Mustang would resemble a standard exercise that the pilot drilled in their training . “ Not to dumb it down , ” the co-pilot , Chris Ferguson , told me — plucking someone with a spinal injury off a moving boat and hoisting them into a moving helicopter is a pretty insane thing to do . “ But we normalize what isn ’ t normal . ”
 A few moment earlier , a the men scurried around Jon on his backboard , packaging and fastening him for the hoist , Jon worried that the second he got airborne he would start twirling uncontrollably , like the feathery end of a cat toy , and potentially thwack his head on the equipment on deck . But now , he wa levitating smoothly — a solitary , swaddled bale of a man , perfectly perpendicular to the ground . Dave and I watched it happen : our friend rising steadily away from u , improbably , to safety . As Jon floated higher , he could hear the Coast Guardsmen on the Mustang beneath him begin to cheer . He felt it wa safe to open his eye . When he did , he saw someone , hunched in the open cargo door of the helicopter , pointing a television camera at him .
 Jon wa rushed into surgery at the hospital in Sitka that evening . He ’ d punctured both lung , one to the point of collapse , sustained multiple fracture on eight of his rib , broken several vertebra , shattered his left shoulder blade and snapped his brachial plexus nerve . His spleen had been macerated into countless fleck . After awakening from surgery , Jon wa disappointed that the doctor had swept those shard into a bag and thrown his spleen in the trash ; he wanted to get a look at it , maybe even keep it preserved in a jar , alongside his cyborg-banana .
 Once back in Gustavus , Dave and I realized that we would need to call Jon ’ s parent in Switzerland . I didn ’ t have to push the job on Dave this time ; he wa adamant . He felt he would need to face conversation like these if he wa going to be a doctor . It wa Jon ’ s father who picked up , and after absorbing the news , he paused and caught Dave off guard . “ Thank you , ” he said solemnly . “ You guy saved my son ’ s life . ”
 Dave ’ s stomach dropped . “ I remember thinking about it , ” he told me recently , “ and realizing , Yeah . I guess , logistically , we did. ” I had the same reaction when Dave hung up the phone and , clearly shaken , relayed his conversation to me . Until that moment , the idea that we saved Jon ’ s life had never occurred to u , possibly because the idea that Jon might have died still hadn ’ t occurred to u . We had zero sense of accomplishment , or even agency . In our mind , all we did wa avoid screwing up until the real help could arrive and save him .
 But Jon hadn ’ t absorbed the story that way . From the instant he willed himself out of the water , he felt all of u locking into that same seamless flow of order steadily displacing chaos that Dave and I only experienced once the Coast Guard arrived . It wa amazing to him how the three of u managed to generate solution for each successive problem . Even my reciting those poem , which to me had always felt like a moment of utter helplessness , became , in Jon ’ s telling , a perfect emblem of that streak of serendipitous problem-solving . “ You conveyed a calmness , ” he told me recently . “ I remember it being this nice moment. ” He added that if he ever ha to spend two hour dying on a remote forest floor again , having me there to recite poetry would be one of his top way to do it .
 The feeling of inevitability that day became only more pronounced for Jon a time passed and the entire story of our rescue receded into a prologue to the rest of his life . The surgery in Sitka wa only the first of half a dozen , and it would take several year for him to regain 60 percent of the use of his arm , wrist and hand , a the nerve gradually regrew along his injured side . He wa in good enough shape to go back to Alaska the summer after the accident — repairing boat in the company ’ s warehouse and occasionally helping out at the bed-and-breakfast — but he struggled . He could repair kayak but needed help lifting them . He wa unable to wrestle the mattress corner into the fitted sheet when he made the bed . After that , he started working at a recording studio in Portland , just a he envisioned while stuck in the water , and he now run his own audio-mastering company : Spleenless Mastering .
 Eventually Jon seemed to have recovered from the accident without any conspicuous disability . But his life ha been quietly corroded by chronic pain and , almost equally , by the stress of navigating the doctor , medication ( and their side effect ) to manage it . About two year after the accident , he learned he had PTSD . The trauma wasn ’ t the falling tree , but his experience of powerlessness a a perpetual patient in the American medical system . It manifested a a kind of unbearable empathy for anyone who wa suffering . Jon found himself shouting at doctor , on his own behalf but also on behalf of stranger in waiting room who weren ’ t being seen . He would hear interview with natural-disaster victim or the homeless on NPR and have to pull his car over . There continued to be other tribulation , too — more mundane one . A few time a year , he still rebreaks a rib out of nowhere ; once or twice , Jon told me , all it ha taken is an especially affectionate hug from his wife .
 Jon found early on that he could cordon off this suffering , both in his own mind and in conversation , by making joke about the accident itself and sticking to the happy ending of our rescue , a trick that got much easier after the National Geographic show aired later that year . “ Mission Rescue : Final Frontier , ” the program wa called . The soundtrack wa all heart-thwacking synth drum and shredding guitar . A foreboding , Ken Burns-effected snapshot of Dave and Jon looking joyful before the trip gave way to a whirring re-enactment of someone else ’ s leg — cast in the role of Dave ’ s leg — sprinting through the blurry wood for our radio . A melodramatic narrator pondered the fate of “ Kayaker Jon Cohrs . ”
 Initially , the schlockiness of the production felt like a blessing . The show depersonalized the accident , giving u all a shorthand to convey how dramatic that day had been , without confronting how destabilizing and senseless it might have felt . At a party , you could lay out the basic — a tree fell on Jon — then say , “ National Geographic even made a TV special about it , ” and everyone would go wide-eyed but then move on , figuring you would unspool the real story some other time .
 But we never realized the degree to which that kitschy shorthand started to obscure the real story — then , gradually , to replace it . I ’ m embarrassed to admit that , though Jon and I have remained close , I did not know the extent to which he ha continued to suffer for the last 17 year until talking to him for several hour in order to write this account .
 The morning after the accident , Dave and I traveled back to Dundas Bay to pack up our campsite and collect the kayak we abandoned the previous evening . We were shuttled there from Gustavus by the same boat captain who dropped u off three day earlier , a forbiddingly taciturn commercial fisherman named Doug Ogilvy .
 The tide in the cove wa way out when we arrived ; it wa , a Ogilvy put it , “ a suck-ass beach. ” The approach wa so shallow that he had to drop anchor a hundred yard or more from shore . He asked if we had wader . We did not . So Ogilvy put on his , climbed down the ladder and told Dave to get on his back . Then stoically , like an ox or an old-timey strongman hauling a safe , he trudged through the thigh-high water , dropped Dave on the gravel beach , then lurched back and hauled me the same way , a if I were a man-size infant in a papoose .
 Dave told me he ’ d had a strange feeling on the ride out , a if we would discover that an even more massive tree had fallen on our tent since we last slept there and that all three of u would have been crushed and killed if we ’ d spent another night in Dundas Bay , a planned . That is , he half-expected to find evidence that the accident had been fortuitous somehow , that there wa a reason , or redemptive value , behind it . My mother had the same instinct when I called her the night before . On the phone I strained to emphasize for her — she wa only two year into her cruelly premature widowhood , and I wa new at being the overprotective son of a widow — that Jon wa going to be all right , and that Dave and I were safe . She told me that my dad must have been up there looking out for u somehow .
 I resented all the supernatural thinking . If it comforted other people , fine , but I ’ d somehow known right away that I didn ’ t need a reason for the accident . It wa senseless , but straightforward , a unequivocal a fact a my father ’ s death had been . A tree fell in the wood . It might not have , but it did . Jon could have died , but he didn ’ t . Other possibility spiraled infinitely outward from there , though apparently I wasn ’ t too interested in contemplating them . As strange a it sound , it wa year before I realized that the tree could have hit me — and only after a friend pointed this out , a I told the story around a fire one night . And it wa only a few week ago , while on the phone with Jon , that it occurred to me that the tree could have hit all three of u — we were standing in a single-file line , after all , waiting to cross the creek — and that we all might have wound up clobbered and scattered in that river , dying slowly and watching each other die .
 It ’ s also probably true that I helped preclude these possibility by being so feverishly paranoid about bear , wheeling around at the sound of the snapping root . That ’ s what allowed me to see the tree coming , just barely , and scream that infinitesimal heads-up for Dave . And so , the real meaning of the accident , if I felt compelled to find one , might be that it validated my most exaggerated fear . But instead , it somehow helped cleanse me of them . There wa comfort for me in accepting the arbitrariness of what happened , in regarding it a a spasm of random damage in time and space that , just a randomly , a small number of human being got the opportunity to repair . We were more capable than I had understood . We were also far more helpless .
 On the ride back to Gustavus with our gear , I pictured myself , again , a a small blip in empty space . The ride wa rough and jumpy a Ogilvy impatiently pounded his boat through the last vestigial wave energy of the storm ; Dave and I had to hold on , to plant ourselves on the bench behind him . But there wa a moment when I felt so safe that I loosened my grip , leaned slightly into the motion of the boat , and , closing my eye , felt myself lift off the seat .

 Rick Steves can tell you how to avoid having your pocket picked on the subway in Istanbul . He can tell you where to buy cooky from cloistered Spanish nun on a hilltop in Andalusia . He can tell you approximately what percentage of Russia ’ s gross domestic product come from bribery . He can teach you the magic idiom that unlocks perfectly complementary gelato flavor in Florence ( “ What marries well ? ” ) .
 But Rick Steves doe not know his way around New York City .
 “ In the Western Hemisphere , ” Steves told me one afternoon last March , “ I am a terrible traveler . ”
 We were , at that moment , very much inside the Western Hemisphere , 4,000 mile west of Rome , inching through Manhattan in a hired black car . Steves wa in the middle of a grueling speaking tour of the United States : 21 city in 34 day . New York wa stop No.17 . He had just flown in from Pittsburgh , where he had spent le than 24 hour , and he would soon be off to Los Angeles , Denver and Dallas . In his brief window of down time , Steves did not go out searching for quaint restaurant or architectural treasure . He sat alone in his hotel room , clacking away on his laptop , working on new project . His whole world , for the time being , had been reduced to a concrete blur of airport , hotel , lecture hall and medium appearance .
 In this town car , however , rolling through Midtown , Steves wa brimming with delight . He wa between a TV interview at the New York Stock Exchange and a podcast at CBS , and he seemed a enchanted by all the big-city bustle a the most wide-eyed tourist .
 “ Look at all the building ! ” he exclaimed . “ There ’ s so much energy ! Man , oh , man ! ”
 A woman crossed the street pushing two Yorkies in a stroller .


 “ How cute ! ” Steves shouted .
 The town car crawled toward a shabby metal hulk spanning the East River .
 “ Wow ! ” Steves said . “ Is that the Brooklyn Bridge ? ”
 It wa almost the opposite of the Brooklyn Bridge . The Brooklyn Bridge is one of the most recognizable structure in the world : a stretched stone cathedral . This wa it unloved upriver cousin , a tangle of discolored metal , vibrating with car , perpetually under construction . The driver told Steves that it wa the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge — or , a most New Yorkers still thought of it , the 59th Street Bridge .
 This revelation only increased Steves ’ s wonder .
 “ The 59th Street Bridge ! ” he said . “ That ’ s one of my favorite song ! ”
 With buoyant enthusiasm , Steves started to sing Simon and Garfunkel ’ s classic 1966 tune “ The 59th Street Bridge Song ( Feelin ’ Groovy ) . ”
 “ Slow down , you move too fast , ” he sang . “ You got to make the mornin ’ last — just — kickin ’ down the cobblestone . ... ”
 The car hit traffic and lurched to a stop . Steves paused to scan the street outside . “ Where are the cobblestone ? ” he asked . Then he refocused . He finished the song with a flourish : “ Lookin ’ for fun and feelin ’ — GROOOVYYYYYY ! ”
 There wa a silence in the car .
 “ Can you imagine those two guy walking around right here ? ” Steves said . “ Just feeling groovy ? Gosh , that ’ s cool . ”
 Steves pulled out his phone and , for his online fan , recorded a video of himself singing “ The 59th Street Bridge Song ( Feelin ’ Groovy ) . ”
 “ It ’ s fun to be in New York City , ” he signed off . “ Happy travel ! ”
 There wa another silence in the car , this one longer .
 “ You know , ” the driver said finally , “ you ’ re not very different than you are on your show . ”
 This wa correct . The driver wa referring to Steves ’ s long-running , widely syndicated , family-friendly public-television travel series , “ Rick Steves ’ Europe , ” on which Steves is a joyful and jaunty host , all eager-beaver smile and expressive head tilt . With a backpack over one shoulder and a hand tucked into his pocket , Steves gush poetically about England ’ s Lake District ( “ a lush land steeped in a rich brew of history , culture and nature ” ) and Erfurt , Germany ( “ this half-timbered medieval town with a shallow river gurgling through it center ” ) and Istanbul ( “ this sprawling metropolis on the Bosporus ” ) and Lisbon ( “ like San Francisco , but older and grittier and le expensive ” ) . He reclines jauntily atop the cliff of Dover and is vigorously scrubbed in a Turkish bath . The show ha aired now for nearly 20 year , and in that time , among traveler , Steves ha established himself a one of the legendary PBS superdorks — right there in the pantheon with Mr. Rogers , Bob Ross and Big Bird . Like them , Steves is a gentle soul who want to help you feel at home in the world . Like them , he seems miraculously untouched by the need to look cool , which of course make him sneakily cool . To the aspiring traveler , Steves is a inspirational a Julia Child once wa to the aspiring home chef .
 [ Read a profile of Terry Gross , the host of “ Fresh Air . ” ]
 Eventually , Steves ’ s busy New York day ended on the Upper East Side , where he wa scheduled to give a talk at a Barnes & Noble . As we drove to the event , Steves confessed that he wasn ’ t sure what kind of crowd he would get . You never knew exactly where his Rickniks ( a the hard-core fan call themselves ) would materialize en masse . Some Steves appearance were mobbed ; others were sparse . His appeal is slightly cultish . For every Ricknik out in the world , a large contingent of average people have no idea who he is .
 I wa mildly skeptical about Steves ’ s drawing power in New York . It wa hard to imagine a bunch of cynical , worldly , urban , polyglot , multicultural East Coast sophisticate — people who probably vacationed at deconsecrated eco-hostels in Oman or Madagascar — getting excited about public television ’ s reigning expert on Europe .
 We arrived , however , to find the bookstore overflowing . A solid wave of applause met Steves at the door . Fans had been pouring in , the organizer told u , for two solid hour . People sat in the aisle and stood in the back . Some wore T-shirts and hat bearing the Rick Steves slogan : “ Keep on Travelin ’ . ” The crowd ’ s body heat overwhelmed the building ’ s climate control .
 I noticed a group of hipster 20-somethings standing near the back , and at first I assumed they had all come sarcastically . But a Steves began to speak , they grinned and laughed with absolute earnestness . Everyone here wa , apparently , a superfan . At one point , Steves showed a slide of tourist swimming in a sunny French river underneath a Roman aqueduct , and the whole crowd gasped . When he mentioned that his website featured a special video devoted to packing light for woman , a woman in the crowd actually pumped her fist .
 At the end of his talk , Steves offered to sign book — but not in the traditional way . There were too many people for a signing table , he said , and anyway , single-file line were always inefficient . ( This is one of his travel credo : avoid waiting in line . ) Instead of sitting down , Steves walked out into the center of the room and invited everyone to open their book and surround him . He pulled out a Sharpie . And then he started to spin . Steves held out his pen and signed book after book after book , fluidly , on the move , smiling a the crowd pressed in . “ We went to Portugal on our honeymoon , ” a man shouted . “ How romantic ! ” Steves answered , still spinning . A woman asked him where to celebrate Christmas in Europe . Steves , in midrotation , still signing furiously , told her that he had made a whole special about precisely that question and that it wa available free on his website . “ Keep on travelin ’ , Rick ! ” someone shouted . “ Keep on travelin ’ ! ” Steves shouted back . As he spun , Steves thanked everyone and gave quick , off-the-cuff advice . In an astonishingly short time , he had signed every book . The people were satisfied . The crowd thinned . Steves finally came to a stop .
 Rick Steves is absolutely American . He wear jean every single day . He drink frozen orange juice from a can . He like his hash brown burned , his coffee extra hot . He dislike most fancy restaurant ; when he ’ s on the road , he prefers to buy a foot-long Subway sandwich and split it between lunch and dinner . He ha a great spontaneous honk of a laugh — it burst out of him , when he is truly delighted , with the sharpness of a firecracker on the Fourth of July . Steves is so completely American that when you stop to really look at his name , you realize it ’ s just the name Rick followed by the plural of Steve — that he is a one-man crowd of absolutely regular everyday American guy : one Rick , many Steves . Although Steves spends nearly half his life traveling , he insists , passionately , that he would never live anywhere but the United States — and you know when he say it that this is absolutely true . In fact , Steves still life in the small Seattle suburb where he grew up , and every morning he walk to work on the same block , downtown , where his parent owned a piano store 50 year ago . On Sundays , Steves wear his jean to church , where he play the conga , with great arm-pumping spirit , in the inspirational soft-rock band that serenade the congregation before the service start , and then he sits down and sings classic Lutheran hymn without even needing to refer to the hymnal . Although Steves ha published many foreign-language phrase book , the only language he speaks fluently is English . He built his business in America , raised his kid in America and give frequent loving paean to the glory of American life .
 And yet : Rick Steves desperately want you to leave America . The tiniest exposure to the outside world , he belief , will change your entire life . Travel , Steves like to say , “ wallop your ethnocentricity ” and “ carbonate your experience ” and “ rearranges your cultural furniture. ” Like sealed window on a hot day , a nation ’ s border can be stultifying . Steves want to crack them open , to let humanity ’ s breeze circulate . The more rootedly American you are , the more Rick Steves want this for you . If you have never had a passport , if you are afraid of the world , if your family would prefer to vacation exclusively at Walt Disney World , if you worry that foreigner are rude and predatory and prone to violence or at least that their food will give you diarrhea , then Steves want you — especially you — to go to Europe . Then he want you to go beyond . ( For a majority of his audience , Steves say , “ Europe is the wading pool for world exploration. ” ) Perhaps , like him , you will need large headphone and half a tab of Ambien to properly relax on the flight , but Steves want you to know that it will be worth it . He want you to stand and make little moaning sound on a cobblestone street the first time you taste authentic Italian gelato — flavor so pure they seem like the primordial essence of peach or melon or pistachio or rice distilled into molecule and stirred directly into your own molecule . He want you to hike on a dirt path along a cliff over the almost-too-blue Mediterranean , with village and vineyard spilling down the rugged mountain above you . He want you to arrive at the Parthenon at dusk , just before it close , when all the tour group are loading back onto their cruise ship , so that you have the whole place to yourself and can stand there feeling like a private witness to the birth , and then the ruination , of Western civilization .
 Steves want you to go to Europe for a long a you can afford to , and he also want to help you afford it . ( Much of his guru energy is focused on cutting cost . ) He want you to go a many time a possible , and while you ’ re there , he want you to get way down deep into the culture , to eat with local in the teeming market , to make a sympathetic fool of yourself , to get entirely lost in your lack of America .
 Out of this paradoxical desire — the enlightenment of Americans through their extraction from America — Steves ha built his quirky travel empire . His guidebook , which started a hand-typed and photocopied information packet for his scraggly 1970s tour group , now dominate the American market ; their distinctive blue-and-yellow spine brighten the travel section of bookstore everywhere . Steves is le interested in reaching sophisticated traveler than he is in converting the uninitiated . ( “ There will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents , ” the Bible tell u , “ than over 99 righteous person who do not need to repent. ” ) Last year , his company led close to 30,000 paying customer on dozen of elaborate European itinerary . Steves teach his follower everything from how to pack a toiletry kit to how to make themselves at home in a small hotel room to how to appreciate a religious tradition they may have been raised to despise . ( In order to enjoy St. Peter ’ s Basilica , Steves admits , he had to learn to “ park my Protestant sword at the door. ” ) He is a sort of spiritual travel agent for America ’ s curious but hesitant middle class . He is simultaneously goofy and dead serious ; he can ping , in an instant , from golly-gee Pollyanna cheerfulness to deep critique of the modern world . In a series of long , affectionate , candid conversation , Steves ’ s colleague described him to me using the word “ sophomoric , ” “ knucklehead ” and “ Santa Claus ” — but also “ juggernaut , ” “ evangelical ” and “ revolutionary. ” Rick Steves want u to travel because it ’ s fun , yes , but also because he belief it might actually save the world .
 I can testify , firsthand , to the power of Rick Steves . In 1998 , he spoke at my college . Nothing about the encounter seemed promising . Our campus wa a tiny outpost in a tiny town , and Steves delivered his talk not in some grand lecture hall but in a drab room in the basement of the student union . I wa poor , shy , anxious , sheltered , repressed and extremely pale . I wa a particular kind of Pacific Northwest white guy — blind to myself and my place in the world . I had never really traveled ; I wa more comfortable on Greyhound bus than on airplane . Going to Europe seemed like something aristocrat did , like fox hunting or debutante ball .
 My girlfriend dragged me to the talk . I had never even heard of Steves . He entered looking like the kind of guy who would bring an acoustic guitar to every single church picnic within a two-hour radius of his favorite Applebee ’ s : large glass , floppy hair , bluejeans , wholesome grin . But what he said over the next hour or so changed the rest of my life .
 It ’ s hard to describe how thoroughly energized Steves becomes in front of a crowd . He pace , gesticulates and speaks very fast . He tell his favorite old joke a if they were eternally new . ( “ Eet smell like zee foot of angel , ” the French cheesemonger always exclaims . ) Onstage , he is a combination of preacher , comedian , salesman , life-hacker , professor and inspirational speaker . Steves told u , that day , how to pack our entire life into a single bag measuring 9 by 22 by 14 inch . ( “ It ’ s enlightened to pack light , ” Steves insists . “ It ’ s a blessing to pack light. ” ) He told u how to find excellent cheap hotel , how to survive on minimalist picnic in public park , how to wash clothing in bathroom sink and how to make friend without sharing a language . Steves ’ s signature book , “ Europe Through the Back Door , ” seemed le like a travel philosophy than a whole mode of being : scrappy , prepared , independent , extroverted . Europe ’ s front door , he told u , wa positioned to feed traveler directly into exploitation : overpriced cafe , trinket shop , long line , corporate high-rise hotel . The back door , by contrast , led to revelation . He showed u impossibly enticing photo : cobblestone piazza teeming with fruit stall , quirky wooden hotel among wildflower in the Alps , vast arsenal of multicolored cheese . He made travel seem le like a luxury than a necessary exploration of the self , a civic responsibility , a basic courtesy to your fellow human . It seemed almost unreasonable not to go . Above all , Steves told u , do not be afraid . The people of the world are wonderful , and the planet we share is spectacular . But the only way to really understand that is to go and see it for yourself . So go .
 My girlfriend and I left the room convert to the gospel of Rick Steves . We bought his book and highlighted it to near-meaninglessness . We started mapping itinerary , squirreling away money , asking relative for donation . ( In probably the worst phone call of my life , my rancher grandfather expressed shock and dismay that I would ask him to support this meaningless overseas lark . ) Eventually , over many month , we scraped together just enough to buy plane ticket and order minimalist Steves-approved supply , including a travel towel so thin and nonabsorbent that it seemed to just push the moisture around your skin until you forgot you were wet . We packed exactly a Steves taught u : T-shirts rolled into space-saving noodle , just enough clothes to get u from one hotel laundry session to the next . Then , for the first time in our life , we left North America .
 One of Steves ’ s strongest recommendation is to keep a journal . Mine wa so corny that it cover actually said “ A TRAVELER ’ S NOTEBOOK ” over a picture of the Eiffel Tower . When I opened it recently , the reality of that long-ago trip hissed out with fresh urgency . My 20-year-old self recorded everything . On our first day in Europe , we bought imported Austrian apple with fat , heavy English coin and saw a woman stumble on a staircase , breaking an entire bag of newly bought china . We arrived at our first hostel , the Y.M.C.A . in Bath , to find a man urinating in the stairwell — so we kept walking until we happened into a nearby churchyard , where the gravestone were so old and thin they were almost translucent . As we tried to make out the name of the dead , songbird sang strenuously in the tree all around u . This juxtaposition — old death , new life — blew my jet-lagged American mind . “ Already , after just one day in Bath , ” I wrote in my journal , “ the world ha grown firmer . Reality fill it gap . ”
 That , more or le , wa the theme of the trip . For six week , we followed the Steves game plan . We shared squalid bunk with other young traveler from Denmark , Australia , Canada and Japan . In the stately public park of Paris , we ate rotisserie chicken with our bare hand . One stifling afternoon at the Colosseum in Rome , we watched a worker slam his ladder against the edge of an arch and break off some ancient brick . ( He looked over at u , looked down at the brick , kicked dirt over them and kept working . ) We were moved by Van Gogh , Picasso and Gaudí , but unmoved by Versailles ( “ more vain than beautiful , ” I wrote ) , bullfighting ( “ more brutal than artful ” ) and Goya ( “ vague and blurry ” ) . Once , I left my underwear on a Mediterranean beach overnight and , since I could not afford to lose a pair , had to go back and pick it up the next day , in full view of all the sunbather .
 Wherever we went , Rick Steves wa with u . In my journal , I referred to him half-jokingly a our “ worldly uncle and guiding light , ” and a we walked around , I annoyed my girlfriend by doing impression of him . We seemed to have entered the world of his slide : the fruit market and overnight train , the sunny French river under the ancient Roman aqueduct . Sometimes our European host , with the quiet pride of someone who once met Elvis , told u story about Steves . He wa a gentleman , they said , a truly good man , and he always came in person to check out their hotel , and he never failed to ask them how their child were doing .
 By the end of our trip , we were completely broke . We couldn ’ t afford even a baguette on our last day in Paris . We flew home looking ragged , shaggy , weather-beaten and exhausted .


 But of course Steves wa right : Our life were never the same . We were still young Americans , but we felt liberated and empowered , like true citizen of the world . The most important thing we learned all had to do with home . As the English writer G.K. Chesterton once put it , in a quote I found printed in my corny old travel journal : “ The whole object of travel is not to set foot on foreign land ; it is at last to set foot on one ’ s own country a a foreign land. ” After looking at a Roman stone wall topped by a Saxon stone wall topped by a medieval English wall next to a modern paved street , I began to see what a thin crust of national history the United States actually stand on . I began to realize how silly and narrow our notion of exceptionalism is — this impulse to consider ourselves somehow immune to the force that shape the rest of the world . The environment I grew up in , with it mall and freeway , it fantasy of heroic individualism , began to seem unnatural . I started to sense how much reality exists elsewhere in the world — not just in a theoretical sense , in book and movie , but with the full urgent weight of the real . And not just in Europe but on every other continent , all the time , forever . I began to realize how much I still had to learn before I could pretend to understand anything . Not everyone need Steves ’ s help to get to this point . Some people get there themselves , or their community help them . But I needed him , and I am eternally glad I wa dragged that day to see him talk .
 [ How to eat in Venice like a Venetian . ]
 Steves answered his front door slightly distracted . I had come in the middle of his breakfast preparation . He wa stirring a block of frozen orange juice into a pitcher of water . “ Freshly squeezed from the can ! ” he quipped . This wa April 2018 , exactly 20 year after my first trip to Europe . I had come to see Steves in the most exotic place possible : his home . He life just north of Seattle , in a town so rainy it ha a free umbrella-share program . There is nothing particularly exotic about the house itself . It ha beige carpeting , professionally trimmed shrub and a back deck with a hot tub . What wa exotic wa simply that Steves wa there . He had just returned from his frenetic speaking tour of the United States and would be leaving almost immediately on his annual trip to Europe . For now , he wa making breakfast : frozen blueberry , Kashi cereal , O.J . “ I would eat this every day for the rest of my life if I could , ” he said .
 But of course , he could not . Steves is gone too much , yo-yoing between the misty forest of the Pacific Northwest and the sun-baked cathedral of Europe . Every year , no matter what else is going on , Steves spends at least four month practicing the kind of travel he ha preached for 40-odd year : hauling his backpack up narrow staircase in cheap hotel , washing his clothes in sink , improvising picnic .
 He is now 63 , and he could afford to retire many time over . But he doesn ’ t have the metabolism for sitting around . Among his colleague , Steves is a notorious workaholic . After grueling day of filming in Europe , he ha been known to slip script revision under the crew ’ s door at 2 a.m. , and then to ask them , at breakfast , for their feedback . On long car ride , he sits in the back seat and type op-eds on his laptop . His relentless hands-on control of every aspect of his business is what ha distinguished the Rick Steves brand .
 It is also , obviously , exhausting — if not for Steves , then at least for the people around him . He ha two child , now grown , and for much of their childhood , Steves wa gone . He wa building his company , changing the world . For very long stretch , his wife wa forced to be a single mother . ( She and Steves divorced in 2010 after 25 year of marriage . ) Every summer , when the family joined Steves in Europe , his pace hardly slackened : They would cover major city in 48 hour , blitzing through huge museum back to back . The kid complained so much , on one trip , that Steves finally snapped — if they were so miserable , he said , they could just go sit in the hotel room all day and play video game . They remember this day a heaven . One year , while Steves wa away , the child converted to Catholicism . His son , Andy Steves , eventually went into the family business : He now work a a tour guide and even published a European guidebook .
 Steves is fully aware that his obsessive work ethic is unusual . He admits that he ha regret . But he can not make himself stop . He ha the fervor of the true evangelist : The more people he meet , the more city he visit , the more life he might change . At one point , a we talked , he pulled out the itinerary for his coming trip — from Sicily to Iceland , with no down time whatsoever . Just looking at it made him giddy . I asked why he couldn ’ t ease up slightly — maybe just spend two month in Europe , maybe just speak in 10 American city .
 “ It ’ s a strange thing , ” he said . “ I get energy from it . It ’ s like I ’ m breathing straight oxygen . What would I do if I stayed home ? Not much . Nothing I would remember . ”
 In his house , Steves offered up a little show and tell . He pointed out an antique silver cigarette lighter shaped like the Space Needle . He sat down at his baby grand piano and lost himself , for a few happy minute , playing Scarlatti . He took me to a room filled with book and reached up to a very high shelf . “ I don ’ t show this to too many people , ” he said , “ because they ’ ll think I ’ m nuts. ” Steves pulled down a thick red binder , the content of which were , indeed , pretty nutty . When Steves wa 13 , he decided , for no apparent reason , to conduct a deep statistical analysis of the 1968 Billboard pop chart . Every week , he would clip the ranking out of his local newspaper and , using a point system of his own devising , graph the top band ’ success on sheet of gridded paper . The line were multicolored and interwoven — it looked like the subway map of some fantastical foreign city . You could see , at a glance , the rising and falling fortune of the Beatles ( red ) and Creedence Clearwater Revival ( black ) and Elvis Presley ( dot and dash ) . Steves kept this up for three year , taping together many piece of graph paper , and in the end he summarized the data in an authoritative-looking table that he typed on the family typewriter . This is what wa in that binder : a systematic breakdown of the most successful band from 1968 to 1970 , a determined by the objective statistic of an analytical adolescent weirdo . ( The winner , of course , were the Beatles — 1,739 point — followed by Creedence , Simon and Garfunkel , Neil Diamond . )
 Steves laughed . It wa ridiculous . But it wa also a perfect window into his mind . Even at 13 , a powerful energy wa coiled inside him — an unusual combination of obsession and precision , just waiting for some worthwhile project to burst out in .
 And that , coincidentally , wa exactly when he found it : the project of his life . In the summer of 1969 , when Steves wa 14 , his parent took him to Europe . They owned a business tuning and importing piano , and they wanted to see factory firsthand . Steves approached this first trip abroad with the same meticulous energy he brought to his Billboard graph . As he traveled around the continent , he recorded the essential data of his journey on the back of postcard : location , activity , weather , expense . One day , Steves spent 40 cent on fishing gear . Another , he met a 79-year-old man who had witnessed the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand . To keep everything in order , Steves numbered the postcard sequentially . He still ha them all packed lovingly into an old wooden box .
 On that same formative trip , the Steves family visited relative in Norway . They happened to be there in July 1969 , when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon . “ Ett lite skritt for et menneske , ” the television said , “ ett stort sprang for menneskeheten. ” In that moment , in that strange place , young Rick Steves felt the concept of “ menneskeheten ” — “ mankind ” — at a depth he never would have been able to access back home . Europe wa a crash course in cultural relativity . In a park in Oslo , he had an epiphany : The foreign human around him , he realized , were leading existence every bit a rich and full a his own . “ Right there , ” he would write later , “ my 14-year-old egocentric worldview took a huge hit. ” A life-changing realization clicked into place . “ This planet must be home to billion of equally lovable child of God . ”
 That first trip set the course for everything that followed . When Steves wa 18 , he went back to Europe without his parent . Soon , life in America became a series of interlude between travel . He taught piano to earn money , then stretched that money a far a he possibly could , sleeping on church pew and park bench , in empty barn and construction zone , from Western Europe to Afghanistan . He turned his cheapness into a science . Instead of paying for a hotel room in a city , Steves would use his Railpass and sleep on a train for the night — four hour out , four hour back . He would stuff himself on free breakfast bread , then try to eat a little a possible for the rest of the day . Naturally , he recorded all this , and today he ha an impressive archive of old travel journal . Their page preserve , in tiny handwriting , shadowy young dissident in Moscow , diarrhea in Bulgaria , revolution in Nicaragua .
 In his 20 , Steves brought his wide-roaming wisdom back to the United States . He started to supplement his piano teaching with travel seminar . His signature class , European Travel Cheap , ran for six hour . Steves could have talked longer than that , but it struck him a impractical for his student . In Europe , he rented a nine-seat minibus and started to lead small tour . Eventually , his seminar and tour note morphed into his book . The first edition of “ Europe Through the Back Door , ” published in 1980 , wa typed on a rented IBM Selectric . It had no ISBN and looked so amateurish that bookstore assumed it wa an early review copy . “ Anyone caught reprinting any material herein for any purpose whatsoever will be thanked profusely , ” it said . This wa the birth of the Rick Steves empire .
 Rick Steves both is and is not his TV persona . Offscreen , he allows himself to be much more explicitly political . He ha the passion of the autodidact . Growing up , Steves led a relatively sheltered existence : He wa a white , comfortable , middle-class baby boomer in a white , comfortable , middle-class pocket of America . Travel did for him what he promise it will do for everyone else : It put him in contact with other reality . He saw desperate poverty in Iran and became obsessed with economic injustice . He started searching for answer in book , scribbling note in the margin of “ Bread for the World , ” by Arthur Simon , and “ The Origins of Totalitarianism , ” by Hannah Arendt . He studied the war industry and colonial exploitation . The first time Steves traveled to Central America , he came back so outraged that he wrote a fiery tract called “ There ’ s Blood on Your Banana , ” then flew to Washington and hand-delivered a copy to the office of every member of Congress .
 In the early day , Steves injected political lesson into his European tour . Sometimes he would arrive in a city with no hotel reservation , just to make his privileged customer feel the anxiety of homelessness . In Munich , he would set up camp in an infamous hippie circus tent , among all the countercultural wanderer of Europe .
 Today , Steves is more strategic . His most powerful tool , he realizes , is his broad appeal . He ha an uncanny knack for making serious criticism feel gentle and friendly . Often he disguise critique of America with a rhetorical move that I like to think of a “ U.S.A. ! U.S.A. ! U.S.A. ! ( But . ... ) ” “ I ’ m unapologetically proud to be an American , ” he writes in the introduction to his book “ Travel a a Political Act. ” “ The happiest day of any trip is the day I come home . ... But other nation have some pretty good idea too . ”
 That ’ s when he hit his audience with legal prostitution , high tax rate and universal health care .
 When I asked Steves about this strategy , he chuckled .
 “ It ’ s not America-bashing , ” he said . “ It ’ s America-loving . I think it ’ s loving America to look at it critically . But you ’ ve got to set it up . You ’ ve got to allay people ’ s concern that you ’ re a communist . So you explain to them : I ’ m a capitalist , I make a lot of money , I employ a lot of people , I love the law of supply and demand . It seems kind of silly , but you ’ ve got to say that . Then , especially the husband who are dragged there by their wife , they go , ‘ I thought he wa a commie , but he ’ s O.K. ’ And then you don ’ t need to be too gentle . You can confront people with a different perspective , and you ’ ll get through . ”
 Steves learned this strategy , he said , from his early day running tour , living with the same people for week at a time . Survival required being pleasant . People didn ’ t want grating lecture about America ’ s shortcoming — even if that wa sometimes his instinct . Instead , he pointed out different perspective with a smile . He became fluent in the need of American tourist . “ I know what their button are , ” he said . “ I know what their attention span is . I don ’ t want to just preach to the choir . I want to preach to organization that need to hear this , so I need to compromise a little bit so the gatekeeper let it through to their world . ”
 This balancing act ha become increasingly difficult over the past two decade , in a world of terrorism , war , nationalism and metastasizing partisanship . After the Sept. 11 attack , most travel company anticipated that the bottom wa about to fall out of the market . They canceled tour and cut back budget . Steves , however , remained defiantly optimistic . He promised his staff that there would be no cut , no layoff and no shift in message . He insisted that a world in crisis needed travel more , not le . Soon the shock of Sept. 11 turned into the Iraq war , which strained the relationship between the United States and even it closest European ally , sending the travel industry deeper into it trough . In his hometown , Steves caused a controversy when he walked around removing row of American flag that had been set up in support of the war . It wa , he argued , an act of patriotism : The flag is meant to represent all Americans , not just war supporter . “ I wa shark-bait on Seattle ’ s right-wing radio talk show for several day , ” he wrote .
 Lately , Steves concedes , his political message ha begun to take over his teaching . In “ Travel a a Political Act , ” the familiar element of his guidebook — walking tour , museum guide , hotel review — are replaced by rabble-rousing cultural critique . Steves express deep admiration for Scandinavian-style social democracy and call out many of America ’ s fault : our addiction to car and gun and mass incarceration ; our deference to corporation ; our long history of cultural imperialism ( “ one of the ugliest thing one nation can do is write another nation ’ s textbook ” ) . Some moment in the book verge on un-American . “ Sometimes , when I ’ m frustrated with the impact of American foreign policy on the developing world , ” Steves writes , “ I have this feeling that an impotent America is better for the world than an America whose power isn ’ t always used for good . ”
 Occasionally , despite his best effort , Steves still ruffle feather . Recent TV special have covered Iran — “ I believe if you ’ re going to bomb a place , ” Steves ha written , “ you should know it people first ” — and the rise of fascism in Europe . In a special about the Holy Land , Steves refers unapologetically to “ Palestine ” instead of “ the West Bank ” or “ Palestinian territory ” ; some viewer were so outraged that they told Steves they were removing PBS from their will . After one recent speech in the Deep South , event organizer refused to pay Steves — their conservative sponsor , he learned , considered his message a form of liberal propaganda .
 In recent year , Steves ha become a happy warrior for an unlikely cause : the legalization of marijuana . He first tried the drug in Afghanistan , in the 1970s , in the name of cultural immersion , and he wa fascinated by it effect on his mind . Today , he is a board member of Norml , the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws , and a regular speaker at Hempfest . In his headquarters you will find a poster of the Mona Lisa holding a gargantuan spliff . In 2012 , Steves campaigned hard for Washington State ’ s successful legalization initiative , and since then he ha barnstormed other state ( Oregon , Maine , Vermont and more ) to make sure the civil liberty are properly passed around . On a shelf in his living room , right there among all the European knickknack , Steves display a sizable bong .
 Sometimes , fan urge Steves to run for office . When I asked him if he would ever get into politics , he had an answer ready : “ I already am. ” Good travel teaching , in his eye , is inherently political . To stay in a family-owned hotel in Bulgaria is to strengthen global democracy ; to pack light is to break the iron logic of consumerism ; to ride a train across Europe is to challenge the fossil-fuel industry . Travel , to Steves , is not some frivolous luxury — it is an engine for improving humankind , for connecting people and removing their prejudice , for knocking distant culture together to make unlikely spark of joy and insight . Given that million of people have encountered the work of Steves over the last 40 year , on TV or online or in his guidebook , and that they have carried those lesson to untold other million of people , it is fair to say that his life ’ s work ha had a real effect on the collective life of our planet . When people tell Steves to stay out of politics , to stick to travel , he can only laugh .
 “ It ’ s flattering to think I could run for office , ” he admitted . “ And it would be exciting . But I think I ’ m accomplishing more right now than I would in office , and I ’ m having more fun . I ’ m skiing with beautiful wax on my ski . When I want to do something , I can do it . ”
 Steves is deeply indifferent to creature comfort . When I visited him , the back seat of his car wa covered with a greenish slime , practically disintegrating , because of a mysterious leak . He just cracked the window to try to dry it out . Steves prefers to spend his money on his favorite cause . His activism can be quirky and impulsive . In 2011 , after hearing that his local symphony orchestra wa struggling , he stepped in with a gift of $ 1 million , spread over 10 year , to help keep it operating . ( This , pointedly , wa how much money he would get back from President George W. Bush ’ s tax cut over a decade . ) Last year , during a chat with one of the national leader of the Lutheran Church , Steves wondered how much it would cost to send every single Lutheran congregation in the United States a DVD of his recent TV special about Martin Luther . It wa something like $ 30,000 ; Steves happily wrote the check . In the 1990s , working in partnership with the Y.W.C.A. , he started investing his retirement saving in local real estate in order to house homeless mother and their child . The plan wa to take that money out of the banking system and let it do a few decade of social good , at which point Steves could sell the building to fund his retirement . Eventually he worked his way up to buying a whole 24-unit apartment complex — and then he donated it outright to the Y.W.C.A . The mother , he said , needed it more than he would .
 Steves is obsessed with the problem of poverty and amazed at our perpetual misunderstanding of it . “ It ’ s not just : You screwed up , so you ’ re poor , ” he said . “ There ’ s a structure that keep half of humanity poor . This need to be talked about . I can do it , and I can get away with it. ” His next TV special , in production now , will investigate extreme poverty and hunger through two very different non-European country : Guatemala and Ethiopia . In the meantime , all the royalty of his latest book — an updated edition of “ Travel a a Political Act ” — are being donated to Bread for the World , an organization that lobby on behalf of hungry people . He is working on making his company ’ s tour completely carbon-neutral .
 “ If I wa trying to build a career on the speaking circuit — if I wa struggling , and I needed these gig — I would not talk about that stuff , ” he said . “ I could just talk about light stuff , and everybody would love it . But I ’ m not working right now to do that . I ’ m not trying to get anywhere that I ’ m not already . I don ’ t need to be anything I ’ m not . I ’ m 63 year old . I could retire now . But I ’ m ramping up . ”
 Indeed , Steves ’ s business ha been booming . Once the travel market finally recovered , some year after Sept. 11 , Steves occupied a disproportionately big share of it — precisely because he had refused to scale back . By taking a principled stand , Steves flourished . Today , his chipper voice is reaching more Americans than ever . “ Fear , ” a Steves like to say , “ is for people who don ’ t get out very much . ”
 [ 4 stop for a woman-focused trip to Seoul . ]
 One night , in his living room , Steves pulled out a plain black notebook . “ Here ’ s something you might find interesting , ” he said with his trademark cheer , and he flipped open to a random page and prepared to read aloud . I wa familiar , by then , with Steves ’ s deep archive of old travel journal , and so I settled in to listen to further adventure from 1975 Moscow or 1997 Paris . This , however , wa something else entirely — a record of a very different kind of journey .
 “ Getting high , ” Steves read , “ release the human in me . ”
 “ Intelligence is a rubber band , ” he continued . “ Getting high is stretching it . ”
 I wa sitting in the beige living room of America ’ s foremost travel guru , underneath framed reproduction of popular European masterworks , and my mind wa about to be well and truly blown . For the next 20 minute , Steves would read me koan about the glory of being stoned .
 “ High is the present , ” he read .
 “ When you ’ re high , you debate long and hard over whether to put on your sweater or turn up the heat . ”
 This journal , Steves explained , contained what he called his “ High Notes. ” For nearly 40 year , he had been writing in it exclusively after smoking marijuana . He would get baked , open up to somewhere in the middle and jot down whatever he happened to be thinking — deep or shallow , silly or angry . There is no chronology ; on every page , axiom from many different decade commingle . It is a lifelong treasury of Steves ’ s stoner thought .
 He continued to read .
 “ As soon a I stop mattering so much , I ’ ll be happier . ”
 “ A baby doesn ’ t know if the hanging is on the wall or if the wall is on the hanging . ”
 “ Make a rug with vacuum mark , so it always look freshly vacuumed . ”
 The entry covered an impressively wide territory . Some were little shred of oracular poetry ( “ We all have a divine harness ” ) , while others were dashed-off semi-witticisms ( “ Wolfgang von Bewildered ” ) or bitter social critique ( “ The spiritual cesspool of America — our shopping mall ” ) . “ They don ’ t let you into heaven without callus on your soul , ” he read at one point . “ Suffer or weep. ” There were scrap of humorous dialogue ( “ ‘ Nothing is wrong with an ego ! ’ he bellowed ” ) and sentence that would have made great bumper sticker on rusting VW bus : “ I ’ d like to be quarantined from reality . ”
 I found myself wondering , for the thousandth time : Who doe this ? What kind of mind not only think of such a project but actually follows through with it , decade after decade after decade ? Who , for God ’ s sake , is this disciplined when they ’ re high ?
 As Steves read , he interrupted himself again and again with great shouting honk of laughter , and I cackled right along with him . Then , suddenly , with almost no transition , we would find ourselves deep in earnest conversation about the nature of true happiness or the danger of ambition . And then we would suddenly be cackling again . We were , in other word , getting high on Steves ’ s “ High Notes . ”
 He kept reading .
 “ I ’ ve been craning my mind to see you , ” he said .
 “ I feel like a hungry bird , but I won ’ t eat any worm I don ’ t like . ”
 Steves showed me complex analytical graph about true love and divorce rate , about the way music sound when you ’ re high versus sober , about the degree of honesty possible with the various people in your life . ( “ Scale of Unconditional Regard , ” this last one wa called . ) One page of the journal had a strand of hair taped to it , labeled “ split end. ” There wa a drawing of a woman ’ s breast . And of course there were many , many more description of getting high itself . “ Getting high is like roasting an English muffin , ” Steves read . “ You start out cold and doughy , and you toast it to a crisp brown , and just a little more and you get all black and burned . ”
 At some point , he looked up from the journal . “ To me , ” he said , “ this is a precious thing . Because this is me . ”
 He kept reading .
 “ Time spent socially is time spent at the expense of personal betterment , ” he said .
 He shook his head . That ’ s how he had thought when he wa young . “ That ’ s my problem , ” he added ruefully . “ I work all the time . ”
 Then he kept reading .
 “ When I die , ” he read , “ scatter me all over the budget hotel of Europe . ”

 When my wife and I were married , my mother-in-law told u she had a special gift for u . I wasn ’ t sure what to expect . She didn ’ t tell u what the gift wa , but she did tell u where it wa . In Sweden , on an island , in the forest .
 As with all magical place , getting to the island in Sweden requires some effort ( particularly a my wife , son and I live in Los Angeles ) . After the plane , the train and a car ride to the countryside , a boat ferry u across the lake from the mainland . There are only a handful of cottage — with no electricity or running water — on the island . It hasn ’ t been developed ( and , I hope , never will be ) . The forest service long ago gave over the island ’ s forest management to nature , so the place is thick with tree : gangly evergreen and white birch , a well a wildflower , blueberry plant and many others . The island is only about 50 acre , but it ’ s quite easy to get lost . Distances walking in the forest are hard to determine . You spend so much time walking over , under and around branch , brush and fallen tree that a simple hike can quickly become a disorienting journey . There are no straight line in a forest .
 In Sweden , mushroom are like gold . Specifically chanterelle mushroom . Aside from their high cost and their subtle earthy flavor ( cooked in butter and served on toast ) , their value is enhanced by how late in the season they grow . So Swedes are extremely protective of their chanterelle patch . And though the custom of allemansratten ( “ freedom to roam ” ) allows everyone access to walk and forage on all land , when a patch is discovered deep in the forest , people sometimes record the GPS coordinate and pas them down like a closely guarded secret .

 The day my mother-in-law took u for our first walk , everything seemed slow and quiet ( besides the buzz of the mosquito ) . I listened to her tell story of playing here a a child ; exploring it made me feel young , and nostalgic for a past I had never lived . I marched behind my wife and wa careful when stepping over fallen tree or catching branch she bent back to allow me to pas . I noticed too that color were brighter — particularly the striking golden-yellow chanterelle , whose unusual billowing shape sometimes reminded me of linen blowing on a clothesline or tiny version of Marilyn Monroe ’ s dress in “ The Seven Year Itch. ” Once I reoriented myself to searching like this , it became sport to find them . Some mushroom you can eat , and some can make you very sick . Animals know this , and people who spend lot of time in the forest know this . My mother-in-law know .
 I wasn ’ t sure how far we had walked , and I would not even have seen the path if it weren ’ t for my mother-in-law ’ s pointing it out . She took u to a clearing among some tree , looked around a bit , then stopped and bent down . She carefully pulled back some leaf and brush and said , “ This is for you. ” It wa a small patch of chanterelle mushroom : a cluster of about five or six undulating golden nugget jutting out of the dark , wet ground . She said she had given each of her child a patch in the forest where she found that mushroom consistently grew each year . “ Some year the animal get to them first , ” she said , “ but we ’ re lucky this year . ”
 It ’ s winter now , and we are back in Los Angeles . But I find myself thinking a lot about my mother-in-law ’ s gava , her gift — our tiny plot of mushroom . The quiet of the forest , maybe it ’ s snowing , maybe it ’ s dark . It ’ s strangely comforting to think of something so small and delicate and so far away — our small space alone on it island where we will return year after year .

 A weeklong trip in Alaska wa supposed to be an adventure . In an instant , it became the experience that defined u all .
 By JON MOOALLEM
 DAVID BENJAMIN SHERRY
 The whale sighting happened right away , minute into Day 1 . Jon , Dave and I had just been dropped off on a remote Alaskan shoreline , an hour and a half by boat from the closest speck of a town . Jon wa working a a sea-kayaking guide that summer in Glacier Bay National Park , and he had invited u up for a seven-day excursion during his week off . As the boat that delivered u vanished , the drone of it engine dampening into a murmur and then finally trailing off , it became unthinkably quiet on the beach , and the largeness and strangeness of our surroundings were suddenly apparent . It wa a familiar phenomenon for Jon from the start of all his trip : a moment that people instinctually paused to soak in . To me , it felt like those scene of astronaut who , having finally rattled free of the earth ’ s atmosphere , slip into the stillness of space . Except we weren ’ t in space . We were on earth — finally , really on earth .
 We were only starting to move around again , packing our gear into the kayak , when we heard the first huff of a blowhole , not far offshore .
 Jon wa ecstatic . It seemed to him a if the animal were putting on a show , swimming playfully in the kelp , diving , resurfacing , then plowing it open mouth across the surface to feed . He took it a a good omen . Though I had no idea at the time , he wa anxious that Dave and I might feel intimidated about making the trip ; such a big payoff , so quickly , would get u excited and defuse any apprehension .
 For Dave , the whale-sighting had exactly the opposite effect . Once , when he wa a kid , his dad took him scuba diving with dolphin . They were friendly , awe-inspiring creature , purportedly , but they terrified Dave instead . He could still conjure the feeling of hanging defenselessly in that water while the animal deftly swirled around him , le like solid object than flash of reflected light , while he could move only in comparative slow-motion . Ever since , he had harbored a fear of large sea creature — a niche phobia , particularly for a young man who lived in the Bronx , but a genuine one still . And so , even a Dave understood that a chance to see whale up close like this wa a major draw of a kayaking trip in Alaska , and though he feigned being thrilled , some second thought were kicking in : We were going out there , he realized .
 The whale left me exhilarated and gleeful , like Jon ; but deeper down , I also remember feeling shaken , like Dave . Nothing about the animal registered to me a playful or welcoming . It just appeared in the distance , then transited quickly past u , from left to right . My uneasiness had something to do with the whale ’ s great size and indifference — it obliviousness — a it passed . Watching it made me feel profoundly out of place and register how large that wilderness wa , relative to me .
 At the time , I wa working at a literary magazine in New York City called The Hudson Review , picking poem out of the slush pile and mailing them to an outside panel of editorial adviser . I wa trying hard in my letter to impress one of them : Hayden Carruth , a gruff and irreverent 81-year-old poet who lived far upstate . I loved Carruth ’ s work but wa more enamored with his persona : his yeoman life in the wood , his intolerance for phoniness and , most of all , the precision with which he articulated common suffering , including one strain of his own suffering that I related to , particularly in those year , but wouldn ’ t have had the courage , or clarity , to examine .
 “ I had always been aware , ” Carruth once wrote of his youth , “ that the Universe is sad ; everything in it , animate or inanimate , the wild creature , the stone , the star , wa enveloped in the great sadness , pervaded by it . ... Never then or now have I been able to look at a cloudless sky at night and see beauty there . A kind of grandeur , yes — but not beauty . The profusion and variety of celestial light have always frightened me . Why are they there ? Why these instead of others ? Why these instead of nothing ? ”
 That wa how I felt , watching the whale from the beach : afraid that everything wa accident . Then again , maybe it ’ s just hard to picture the start of the trip in retrospect without amplifying some feeling of foreboding . Something else Carruth wrote that ha always stuck with me : “ The wilderness begin at the edge of my body , at the edge of my consciousness , and extends to the edge of the universe , and it is filled with menace . ”

 It wa mid-August 2002 , and we were 23 , 24 and 25 . We had graduated from college together two year earlier . Dave , whom I also grew up with , shot out of undergrad knowing he wanted to be a doctor and had just finished his first year of medical school . Any similar momentum I had after graduation wa instantly sapped . Three night after I returned to my parent ’ house from school , I found myself driving my father to the emergency room . Three week after that , he died . My grief wa disorienting and total ; at a moment in life when everything is supposed to feel possible , making any single decision became impossible . I gave into that sadness for the better part of a year , resettling at home in New Jersey with my widowed mother and sliding back to the summer job I worked during school , glumly breaking down beef at a butcher shop two town over .
 I coped with my fatherlessness and confusion in way I ’ m not proud of and still don ’ t understand . I read a lot of book about Ronald Reagan , for example , even the collection of his love letter to Nancy . I also lashed out at Dave , who wa living at home that summer , too , studying for the MCAT . He withdrew awkwardly after the funeral , and I suppose I wa happy to hold that against him . It triggered some longstanding jealousy . A part of me always resented how he seemed unfairly exempt from the self-doubt and heaviness that I wa prone to .
 Jon , meanwhile , wa teaching at a rustic little boarding school in Switzerland , where his mother wa from . The summer after graduation , before starting the job , he set out for Alaska with a friend , sleeping in the bed of their old pickup . In the minuscule town of Gustavus , the gateway to Glacier Bay , he picked up seasonal work in the warehouse of a kayak-tour company . Jon had little actual experience of sea kayaking but had always felt drawn to the ocean in the abstract . In college , he and another friend plotted out a paddling expedition near Glacier Bay , across the border in Canada and applied for a grant from our school to fund it . The grant wa set up in memory of an alumnus who died in an avalanche while mountaineering . It wa meant to encourage the “ responsible and conscientious pursuit of wilderness expeditions. ” Safety wa key . But the committee rejected Jon and his partner ’ s application . They seemed insufficiently prepared .
 That wasn ’ t surprising . Jon grew up doing a lot of backcountry camping and wa a competent outdoorsman , but putting together a grant application required a kind of administrative fastidiousness he didn ’ t always posse . He wa bright but scatterbrained , forever picking up thing and putting them down , both figuratively ( music project , conversation ) but also literally . I can still picture him hustling around the house we shared in college , hunting for his key or his soldering iron , having gotten in over his head rewiring some device . He wa an artist ; one piece I remember consisted of a half-peeled banana , implanted with circuitry and suspended in a jar of formaldehyde . Once , he grew grass in our upstairs bathroom — a living bathmat , he said — until the turf became muddy and flooded the downstairs .
 This wa Jon ’ s third summer in Alaska , and he ’ d worked his way up to leading expedition , taking out vacationer for day at a time . Our trip , however , would venture beyond the typical circuit , into a remote corner of the park that he ’ d never been to . Jon had no serious concern about our safety , but he felt he bore responsibility for our emotional well-being . To enjoy ourselves , we would need to feel comfortable , not just in the wilderness but also with him a a leader .
 He suspected we wouldn ’ t trust him entirely . We didn ’ t . We knew him before he became a professional guide , and our perception of his expertise lagged behind the reality . “ With Jon , ” Dave told me , “ it wa always unclear to what extent he ’ d thought everything through. ” Dave remembered landing in Gustavus the night before we got underway and casually asking Jon a lot of question : Where are we going , exactly ? Do we have everything we need ? Jon seemed to have solid answer for all of them . As we headed back to his place for a good night ’ s sleep , he told u to wait in the yard . He wa living alone for the summer in a house that an acquaintance wa building in the wood . The structure wa framed-up but largely wall-less , and Jon , to be safe , needed to check that no moose had wandered in .
 After a spectacular first day of paddling , we came ashore on a rocky tidal flat about two mile from where we were dropped . Jon gave u his detailed tutorial about bear safety while we set up our campsite . He taught u , for example , to holler “ Hey , bear ! ” if we heard any rustling but also preventively , ahead of u , when we walked through the wood . The last thing you wanted wa to come across a brown bear unannounced .
 “ Hey , bear ! ” Jon kept hollering , by way of demonstration . He said it goofily , like a child ’ s TV host greeting some down-on-his-luck ursine neighbor at the doorway to their clubhouse . This wa intentional . Jon had noticed that the people on his trip often resisted bellowing “ Hey , bear ! ” into the wilderness . It wa essential for their safety , but it felt silly or vulnerable somehow , like singing in public . So he learned to turn it into a shtick , spinning it into a stream-of-consciousness narration : Hey , bear , I ’ m coming into the tree now . Hope you ’ re having a fantastic evening , Mr. Bear ! It loosened everyone up . They were performing for their friend now ; the whole group wa in on the joke .
 I had never seen a wild bear , though I have backpacked in bear country a handful of time . I felt comfortable with the animal in the abstract . But here , the bear weren ’ t abstract ; they breached the material plane . There were bear trail everywhere , leading from the tree line to the water , and disquietingly close , I felt , to where we were pitching our tent . We found heap of their scat . We saw tree where the animal had slashed off the bark to eat the inner layer , tuft of fur from their paw still plastered in the sap .
 I pretended I wa having fun . But that evening I grew increasingly petrified , almost delirious . My eye tightened , scanning for bear . The sound of the wind became bear , and so did the mossy stick cracking under our foot . I gave myself a migraine , then phased in and out of sleep .
 At sunrise , I woke feeling foolish . While Jon cooked pancake , I reasoned with myself , privately , in a notebook I brought on the trip . I tried to conceive of the situation a a geometry problem . Yes , some number of bear roved this landscape , I wrote : relatively tiny , independent blip , going about their business randomly , just like u . In all that empty space and confusion , a lethal collision of their moving blip and our moving blip would be an improbable coincidence . I ’ d been distorting those odds , mistaking myself for “ the absolute focus of all bear ’ attention , ” I wrote . It wa embarrassing , really . “ To be afraid of bear , ” I concluded , “ is to be narcissistic . ”
 I wa reminding myself that freakishly horrible thing are , by definition , unlikely to happen . Even now , my reasoning feel sound .

 Day 2 wa a slog . We paddled through a spitting drizzle in an endless straight line , along the high granite wall of the coast . We talked le and le , just pushed through the emerald chop . Then eventually we gave up , hauling in our boat and making camp in a wide , crescent-shaped cove , short of the site that Jon originally picked out on his map .
 We had entered Dundas Bay , a rarely visited pocket of the national park that , I ’ ve since learned , ha a storied history a a hide-out for solitary misanthrope . In the 1930s , one prospector built a cabin not far from our campsite and brandished a gun at the Alaska Natives who passed through .
 We intuited that the scenery wa beautiful , but we could see very little of it through the fog . Our guidebook explained that “ the east side of the bay ” — where we were — “ can get extremely rough during foul weather , since large wave roll in ... and batter this shoreline. ” That wa happening now : The weather that plinked at u all afternoon wa roiling into a storm . Soon , the big rain started . We rushed through dinner , then loafed in our tent until , eventually , the loafing turned to sleep .
 A local newspaper would later describe the storm a “ short but intense. ” In Gustavus , a creek swelled to about a foot higher than it previous record . Gale wind , with gust up to 59 mile per hour , turned back two cruise ship in Skagway , about 85 mile north . Around 2 a.m. , we woke to discover the wind had shorn the rain fly off our tent . Jon ’ s sleeping bag and mine were soaked , while Dave wa snug and dry between u . We heard torrent of water lashing down and the wave crashing in the cove .
 We got up three or four hour later . The rain and wind no longer felt ferocious but were still too gnarly to paddle through ; there wa no question , Jon said , that we were staying put . We cooked breakfast and took turn playing chess in the tent . By late morning , the storm seemed to have passed . We were antsy . We figured we would take a look around .
 The terrain wa crammed with thicket of alder and spruce , underlain by fern and a furor of prickly thing . Jon pointed out devil ’ s club : three or four foot tall and leafy , armored up and down with spine . The plant pierced fleece and hurt like fire .
 There were no trail . We ’ d been trudging for some time when we reached a fast-moving stream , maybe 10 foot wide . Jon wa surprised ; it wasn ’ t on his map , most likely just a drainage bloated by the storm . We followed it downstream , looking for a way across , and eventually found it bridged by a hefty tree trunk . It seemed like an easy crossing . Jon stepped up and led the way , and Dave and I waited in a single-file line on the stream bank behind him . The creek wa loud , like a factory with all it gear and roller churning . Looking down , Jon realized there wa more water than he ’ d thought .
 That ’ s when I heard the snap in the wood behind me . After all my paranoia , I instantly understood that the many bear I ’ d thought I heard before were absolutely not bear — were nothing — because this sound wa so unmistakable and crisp , so explicitly something . I turned and hollered , “ Hey , bear ! ” then waited a beat . Maybe I said “ Hey , bear ! ” again ; I ’ m not sure . But I must have scanned those tree long enough to feel satisfied and safe , because I know I wa turning my head , to go back to my friend , when I saw the dark shape rushing forward in my peripheral vision .
 What I heard must have been root popping . If a tree is large enough , you can apparently hear them cracking underground like gunfire .
 The thud wa seismic . The trunk crashed down right next to me . Mapping out bit of evidence later , we concluded that the tree must have been about 80 foot tall and perhaps two foot in diameter . It wa some kind of conifer — a spruce or cedar . I screamed , involuntarily , “ Look out ! ” then watched Dave , a few step directly in front of me , dive sideways and hit the ground . When I got to him , he wa crouching , stunned but O.K . He looked up and said , “ Go get Jon . ”
 It hadn ’ t clicked back in for me : There were three of u . The sight of Dave going down had canceled out everything else . I scrambled out over the creek , running across the tree that had just fallen , shouting Jon ’ s name , then spotted him in the water , tangled in a snarl of sheared-off branch near the bank behind me — a cage , which kept him from hurtling downstream .
 He did not know he ’ d been hit by a falling tree . It had narrowly missed his head , struck his left shoulder , shearing it from his collarbone and breaking many of his rib . Later , a doctor would explain that the downward force had been so powerful that it had probably squashed Jon ’ s entire upper body , and all the organ inside , down toward his waist , momentarily compressing him like a bellow ; for a split second , his shoulder headed in the direction of his bellybutton , before his torso sprang up again .
 Jon had heard nothing , seen nothing . He wa turning around to help Dave onto the log — again , feeling responsible for our safety — and the next thing he knew , he wa in the water . He tried to reach out his left arm but could not make it move . He could not move his leg . He felt a bolt of pain down his spine .
 Jon later described flashing through an idiosyncratic sequence of thought , all in a few millisecond , a if watching a deck of card fanning across a table . One wa an image of himself in a wheelchair , sitting behind a mixing console in a fancy recording studio . “ I guess I can become a recording engineer in a wheelchair , ” he remembered thinking . He had never worked in a recording studio and , though he played music , he had no particular plan to . Still , this vision apparently felt like an acceptable future and freed him to resurface in the present . That wa when he registered me , screaming his name .
 Jon told himself he shouldn ’ t move . He knew from his many wilderness first-responder training that moving a person with spinal injury risk paralysis . Then again , he also knew that most of his body wa submerged in cold water , and he recognized that he risked dying of hypothermia if he didn ’ t move . “ If I ’ m already paralyzed , ” he concluded , “ I may a well move . ”
 He somehow hoisted himself out of the stream before Dave or I got to him , using his right arm and his chin and biting into something loamy with his teeth , for additional leverage . He reassessed the situation : better . Also : worse . He now realized that we were at least a mile inland from our camp .
 Suddenly , his body wa walking ; his leg just started working . Dave and I put him between u , supporting his frame . He wa moving faster than we expected , but uncoordinatedly . Then he crumpled between u . We tried again ; Jon wa dead weight . Dave noticed that his breathing wa shallow and his voice wa low — sign , Dave knew from med school , of a collapsed lung . He began battering Jon with a pep talk , telling him , firmly , that he had to get up , that we had to get out of here . Jon didn ’ t need that explained to him ; he wa cogent and still trying to plot our next step in his mind . He looked down to see why this log he wa resting on wa so lumpy and realized that he wa , in fact , sitting on his left arm . The arm wa slack , obviously broken ; his sleeve , pierced up and down with devil ’ s club . Jon had zero feeling in it . He found it amusing , this sensation of complete estrangement from one of his limb .
 Jon had been stressing that it wa important to stay together . But this wa another theory of wilderness survival that appeared to be breaking down in practice . Someone would have to get on the radio back at our camp . By chance , while marooned in our tent during the rainstorm the night before , Jon showed u how to use the device , though he did it almost a a formality ; the hand-held VHF unit wa merely a line-of-sight radio , he told u , meaning it range wa small , it signal too weak to pas through most obstacle . You were unlikely to reach anyone you couldn ’ t see , and we hadn ’ t seen anyone since a faraway fishing boat , early on Day 1 .
 There wa a moment of discussion , or maybe just an exchange of look between me and Dave . I told Dave he should go . I didn ’ t trust myself to find my way back . I also knew that I lacked the courage to try ; whether I wa being sensible or cowardly , I still don ’ t know . Besides , I took for granted that Dave would make it . He wa more capable in my mind , le likely to cinch himself in indecisive knot .
 Recently , though , Dave told me : “ You probably had no idea how much in my own head I wa . I know that you , growing up , definitely felt insecure about thing , and I think you looked at me and thought , Dave ha everything figured out . But I had so much anxiety. ” He brought up the tremor he used to have in his hand . I knew about it ; in high school , we waited table together , and I occasionally had to carry out Dave ’ s soup order , so he wouldn ’ t spill . But I guess I thought of the tremor a strictly physiological . I couldn ’ t see the vulnerability causing it .
 Now , a Dave sprinted away from me and Jon , swatting devil ’ s club from his path with the rubberized sleeve of his rain jacket , his nerve rose up and rattled him . He worried he wouldn ’ t be able to find the radio once he got back or know how to turn it on . What if he broke the radio , foreclosing whatever marginal chance we had of getting help ? There were lot of way to screw this up , Dave realized . More occurred to him a he ran .
 He found the radio . He turned it on . Then , having solved these problem , he encountered another he hadn ’ t anticipated : “ What is the appropriate thing you ’ re supposed to say ? ” he remembered thinking . On TV , you see a lot of people saying “ Mayday. ” And so , Dave faced the open water and started broadcasting into the fog : “ Mayday , Mayday. ” Even in that moment , though , alone on a beach in the middle of nowhere , he felt slightly self-conscious about it . This is so goddamn cliché , he thought .
 Back in the wood , kneeling over Jon , I wa having the same problem : I didn ’ t know what to say . He wa lying near a log on his injured side , his beard and glass flecked with dirt and tendril of moss . He seemed to be on the brink of losing consciousness . At no time would the possibility of Jon ’ s dying surface concretely in any of our mind . Still , I knew I wa supposed to keep talking to him , to tether him to the world with my voice somehow .
 I started vamping platitude : We were going to get out of here soon , and so forth . But I could feel myself treading water , even blundering , at one point , into a long-winded apology , worried I overstayed my welcome that one Christmas with his family . I wa afraid that the helplessness in my voice might be counterproductive , unsettling Jon instead of steadying him . It wa a tremendous silence to fill .
 What can a person say ? I had two literature professor in college who made u memorize poem . You never knew when some line of verse would come in handy , they claimed . One liked to brag that , while traveling through Ireland , he found that if he spat out some Yeats at a pub , he could drink free . This is how I wound up reciting a love poem to Jon .
 It wa “ The Shampoo , ” by Elizabeth Bishop , a lyric poem about the enormity of time , which turn startlingly intimate at the end , when Bishop offer to shampoo her lover ’ s silvering hair : “ Come , let me wash it in this big tin basin , /battered and shiny like the moon . ”
 After that , I imagine I also did some W.H . Auden ; I knew a fair amount of Auden back then . The stuff in rhyme and meter wa always easiest to memorize — “ Looking up at the star , I know quite well/That , for all they care , I can go to hell ” — which is why I had a lot of Robert Frost at my disposal a well : “ Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening , ” “ The Road Not Taken. ” For the most part , I trafficked in hit .
 Jon and I would spend about an hour and a half together alone on the forest floor . I ran through everything in my quiver — Kay Ryan , A.R . Ammons , Michael Donaghy — padding each poem with little prefatory remark , while Jon said nothing , just signaled with his eye or produced a sound whenever I checked in . I felt like a radio D.J . playing record in the middle of the night , unsure if anyone wa listening . And here ’ s one about owl by Richard Wilbur , I would tell Jon , and off we would go .
 I must have also done at least one by Hayden Carruth , my curmudgeonly pen pal at the literary magazine . Carruth ’ s poem didn ’ t lend themselves to memorization , but I ’ d worked hard to nail one of my favorite , in which he describes stopping to notice a deer standing in an apple thicket , then realizing the northern light are flaring overhead . Hayden and the animal pas a moment in stillness together . “ We are proud to be afraid , ” he writes , “ proud to share/the silent magnetic storm that destroys the stars. ” Relative to that boundless violence above them , he and the deer are momentarily allied , though still not entirely connected : “ a glimpse , an acknowledgment/it is enough and never enough . ”
 That ’ s what I said to my friend , powerlessly , tenting my jacket over his face when it started to rain . The title of the poem is : “ I Know , I Remember , But How Can I Help You . ”
 The Coast Guard cutter Mustang wasn ’ t where it wa supposed to be . The 110-foot patrol boat normally spent it time coursing through the Gulf of Alaska , inspecting halibut-fishing vessel , or circulating , a a terrorist deterrent , near the oil terminal at Valdez . It wa home-ported in Seward , hundred of mile from Glacier Bay . But the crew wa transiting to Juneau for a training when , a few day earlier , they were smacked by the same storm that later poured inland , over u . “ We had gotten absolutely pummeled , ” John Roberts , a petty officer on the Mustang , told me recently . For two day , the boat swished around in 15-foot-plus sea . Many on the crew had been hunkered in the mess deck , vomiting , while Roberts and a couple of his shipmate did their best to cover everyone ’ s watch . Finally , the Mustang slipped into Glacier Bay to find some protection . The weather started to ease . That afternoon , a Roberts piloted the Mustang east , toward Dundas Bay , his pallid crewmates were finally staggering back up to the bridge , asking where the hell they were .
 That wa when Dave ’ s Mayday call came through . The signal on the Mustang ’ s radio wa thin and faint , barely edging into range . Another of the ship ’ s petty officer , Eamon McCormack , explained to me that in retrospect the connection feel “ mind-boggling. ” Glacier Bay National Park extends over more than 5,000 square mile . Our signal would have covered two or three mile at most . And yet , a boat — a Coast Guard boat , no le — happened to be passing through that exceedingly small window at precisely the right time . “ I don ’ t know if , nine time out of 10 , you play that over again and the outcome would be the same , ” McCormack said . A moment earlier or later — second , potentially — and we might have slipped out of alignment . The moving boat would have cruised out of range , uncoupling from u forever .


 It wa 1:25 p.m. when the Mustang received Dave ’ s call , according to one of the subsequent Coast Guard report . Roberts couldn ’ t believe it . “ Come on , man , I ’ m tired , ” he said aloud , wearily , to the receiver in front of him . Roberts waited for a moment , per protocol , on the off chance that the Coast Guard ’ s central communication center in Juneau would pick up the call instead . Then he turned and asked his watch commander to pull out all the standardized search-and-rescue paperwork . He wa steeling himself , resummoning his professionalism . “ I guess we ’ re doing this , ” he said .
 Roberts wa the crew member on the Mustang with the most current medical training ; he would complete his E.M.T . certification the following month . As he started firing question at Dave on the radio , he didn ’ t like the answer that he heard coming back : the shallowness of Jon ’ s breathing , the likelihood of a punctured lung . More fundamental , Roberts remembered : “ Any time a tree fall on somebody , it ’ s not good. ” He wa also unsettled to learn that Dave and I both lived in New York City — a red flag , he had found , when someone wind up in trouble in the wilderness .
 We were 100 nautical mile from the nearest hospital ; a half-day trip , even in ideal condition . The Mustang requested that the Coast Guard Air Station in Sitka send a helicopter , but the immediate plan wa for Roberts and three crewmates to peel toward shore in the ship ’ s Zodiac and track u down . Dave had found the flare in Jon ’ s emergency kit and now , at 2:20 , with the Zodiac underway , the Coast Guard asked him to fire it . He wa still in front of our campsite , facing the water . He ’ d never shot off a flare before . He aimed straight up , then watched a the bright tracer rose and arced somewhere far behind him , deep in the wood . He wa uncertain whether this counted a a success . He started scanning the fog in front of him , but the Zodiac never appeared .
 Someone on the Mustang caught sight of the flare near the end of it arc and immediately directed the crew on the Zodiac toward it , steering them far away from Dave to the opposite side of the little peninsula we ’ d camped on . And yet , this wa lucky : they wound up coming ashore much closer to where I wa waiting in the wood with Jon . Soon , whatever poem I wa reciting wa interrupted by whistle blowing and voice calling , and eventually three shape , wearing hard hat and heavy orange rain gear , rushed toward u out of the tree .
 Roberts wa especially impressive , a reassuringly large Boston-area native with a booming voice . He knelt and took Jon ’ s vitals . The information wa troubling : his pulse wa 60 beat per minute ; his breathing , fast and shallow . They put his neck in a brace and eased him onto a kind of truncated backboard , called a Miller board , to move him out to the beach . Dave had returned by then . He and I crouched at one end of the board , near Jon ’ s foot , a someone — presumably Roberts — bellowed a count of three to lift .
 Later that night , lying down to sleep in a bed-and-breakfast in Gustavus — stunned and depleted , but dry and warm — Dave and I would talk and talk , reviewing the entire ordeal . We had drooped into a long silence , coasting toward sleep , when Dave spoke up with one last observation . When we were getting ready to lift Jon on the backboard , he said , it occurred to him that this wa one of those crisis moment you hear about , like when mother are suddenly able to lift a car off their baby . Dave expected we were going to have superhuman strength .
 We did not have superhuman strength . On Roberts ’ s command , the men raised Jon to waist height , swiftly and seemingly perfectly level , a though their arm and deltoid were hydraulic . Then , in one motion , they took off downhill , with negligible help from u . This can ’ t be accurate , but I remember the sensation of being almost dragged , like child in a sled .
 A National Geographic television crew wa embedded at the Coast Guard ’ s air station in Sitka , filming an installment of a thrill-ride reality series . The network had sent crew to other Coast Guard station around the country too , though this assignment appeared to hold the most dramatic potential . Air Station Sitka wa unique : Its pilot were responsible for 12,000 mile of coastline , a sprawling , treacherous wilderness riven with fjord , inlet and glacier , often buffeted by implacably horrible weather . People who went into the backcountry in Alaska had a way of getting themselves into a different magnitude of trouble , too ; a Roberts put it , “ When stuff happens in Alaska , it ’ s big. ” Still , this wa the television crew ’ s eighth day in Sitka , and a the show ’ s producer , Annabelle Hester , explained : “ I wa having call with my boss at headquarters saying , ‘ Nothing is happening ! ’ We were scrambling to come up with Plan B. ” Then , the Mustang ’ s call came in at 1:42 .
 “ What type of injury are we looking at ? ” asked the dispatcher . She wa taking the call from behind a semicircular counter , like the reception desk at a midlevel corporate branch office . She had a framed snapshot of a parakeet to brighten her work space , and a photograph of a dog with a heart that said , “ I Woof You. ” A cameraman stood conspicuously beside her , holding a tense , tight shot .
 “ Probable broken rib , a definite broken arm , ” said the man on the other end . Then his voice faltered , seemed to give up : “ And whatever else would happen to you if a tree fell on you , ” he added .
 The dispatcher retrieved the appropriate paperwork and scribbled “ Tree fell on person ” on one line . She read the current weather aloud : “ 30 knot wind , 300 ceiling , heavy rain and one-mile vis. ” That would soon be revised : the ceiling had dropped to 100 foot . Entering the weather condition on one of the Coast Guard incident report , someone would write , in a kind of nihilistic catchall : “ Extremely terrible . ”
 The Coast Guard ’ s policy wa to deploy a helicopter within 30 minute of the initial request , but the Air Station ’ s operation officer , Cmdr . Karl Baldessari , informed everyone that this mission would take longer to plan . Baldessari wa a 25-year veteran of the Coast Guard , a fast-moving , sinewy man in a blousy flight suit , with a tidy mustache and spiky hair . His role at the air station wa that of a firehouse chief . He wa responsible for the safety of everyone working there , which meant making judicious decision about what warranted sending them hurtling through the sky .
 That calculus got knotty in condition like these , though there wa a baseline volatility to flying in Alaska at all . The Coast Guard didn ’ t let it helicopter pilot fly lead out of Sitka , no matter how much experience they had at other air station , until they practiced difficult landing at specific location in the region and got their ego battered a little by logging a full winter in the state . Visibility in Alaska wa frequently poor ; condition changed quickly . One pilot told me about blindly tunneling through fog in the dark when his co-pilot got “ caged ” : The man lifted his eye momentarily from his instrument and , without any visual reference or a horizon to latch onto , found it impossible to reorient himself , lost all sense of direction and wa felled by vertigo .
 During much of the year it wa also cold enough , with sufficient moisture in the air , that ascending to clear the region ’ s many minor mountain or even just flying through a cloud risked the aircraft ’ s icing up . To mitigate this , the Coast Guard had laid out virtual “ track line ” across the entirety of their range : a grid of GPS point and a network of path connecting them , along which pilot could chart a course and fly at a relatively low altitude , confident they weren ’ t going to smash into a mountain . The system wasn ’ t comprehensive ; the track line got the pilot close to their destination , but ultimately they had to diverge from this GPS superhighway and fly the remaining distance the old-fashioned way , with their radar and eye . It wa like taking an exit off the interstate , except there might be a granite wall in front of you wherever you chose to get off . It wa possible the pilot would travel very far — a half-mile away from whoever needed their help — only to discover that the last leg wa too risky and be forced to turn back .
 Baldessari gathered the two pilot on duty that afternoon and the Air Station ’ s flight surgeon , then unrolled a large paper map . He pointed to our location , explaining : “ That ’ s probably one of the lousiest place we fly in and out of . This Inian Pass , right here , is the worst place we could possibly go . ”
 Inian Pass is a slim channel near the center of the Icy Strait , the long , interconnected system of waterway stretching through Glacier Bay . Conditions in the Icy Strait can be bad 300 day of the year , Baldessari recently told me ; wind , rain and storm surge all push through it fast from the open ocean . But Inian Pass is a narrow keyhole at the center of the strait — a mile-wide opening between a few uninhabited island and a rocky point — where all that weather speed up . The only way for the pilot to reach u would be to fly straight through it .
 Nothing in the National Geographic footage , at this point , feel reassuring . The flight surgeon hold his hand over his mouth and bite his lip . The co-pilot , Chris Ferguson , only a few month into his posting in Alaska , mill around and fidget with his ear . It ’ s obvious Baldessari need convincing . He wasn ’ t eager to send his men up if he didn ’ t have to and wasn ’ t certain they would make it all the way there if he did .
 “ It ’ s kind of funny , ” he told the pilot , pointing at the map . “ You ’ ve got a boat right here . ”
 Lying on his backboard like a burl of driftwood , Jon wa conscious and cognizant of his pain , but he had started to feel somehow buffered from his body , uninterested in connecting with the world beyond it . He would later describe himself a a “ thinking blob . It wa a very passive experience. ” He didn ’ t know what wa happening but could tell our momentum had stalled . He wa confused and felt impatient . In his mind , the three of u had solved the impossible problem : We ’ d managed to get help . This wa supposed to be the simple part , when everyone rushed him to the hospital . Instead , his condition deteriorated . Within 10 minute of reaching the beach , Jon threw up . I ’ d never seen anything like it , a kind of dark purple gristle . I took out my wool cap to wipe his face , and he retched a second time , straight into my hat .
 “ I got that all over me , ” John Roberts told me recently . He ’ d seen vomit like that before ; it meant Jon had ingested a fair amount of blood and signaled internal injury . It made Roberts anxious . He had been on the Mustang for two and a half year at that point but had spent the previous four year in Palm Beach , a busy but le extreme posting that often involved rescuing weekend boater from relatively close to shore — and where , Roberts pointed out , the water is warm and won ’ t necessarily kill you if you go in . Moreover , the bulk of the Coast Guard ’ s training is for maritime rescue , not rescue on land . Counterintuitive a it sound , Roberts ’ s comfort level and confidence had dropped significantly once he hopped off the Zodiac and set foot on the beach .
 He reported back to the Mustang that Jon had thrown up , then soon radioed again , explaining that Jon wa going into shock . He kept giving and requesting update , trying to gauge how long this might take , and eventually started erecting a makeshift shelter out of plastic sheeting and medical tape , hoping to keep Jon out of the rain . Out of earshot of u , Roberts explained to his crew mate Eamon McCormack what the vomit meant : The possibility of Jon dying , here under their care , wa real . At one point in the National Geographic footage , a Roberts ’ s call are relayed to the air station in Sitka , you can see where the dispatcher clearly writes on her form : “ E.M.T . doe not feel comfortable . ”
 By this time , the air station ’ s flight surgeon had received enough information to be alarmed . “ It sound like he ’ s got a pretty significant chest injury , ” he told Baldessari . Baldessari understood they would need to launch a helicopter but warned the Mustang that the aircraft might not make it through the weather ; ultimately it would be the pilot ’ call , once they veered off their last track line and tried to shoot through Inian Pass .
 They would go and give it a look , Baldessari explained over the radio , but the outlook wa iffy . The guy on the beach , he said , must be prepared to get Jon back on their cutter and haul him to a hospital themselves , a fast a they could .
 One evening this winter , my phone rang , and it wa Karl Baldessari . Long retired from the Coast Guard , he wa teaching aviation at a community college in Oregon , where I left a voice mail message earlier that day . I meanwhile had metamorphosed into a 40-year-old father of two and fumbled to explain to Baldessari that , a thrilled a I wa to have tracked him down , I wa , at the moment , racing to finish a risotto for my daughter before gymnastics practice and would have to call him back . Without missing a beat , Baldessari blared order at me , joking , but still sounding a instinctually in charge a he did in the National Geographic footage : “ O.K. , ” he said , “ you want to stir it constantly , but slowly ! ”
 I didn ’ t expect any of the Coast Guardsmen I wa cold-calling to remember that day . However dramatic it remained for me , I assumed it would have been obscured in a yearslong wash of more sensational incident . But everyone I spoke to did remember it , immediately and in detail . Baldessari had been involved in hundred of rescue operation during his 30-year career , and yet , a I stood at the stove on the phone that evening , he told me : “ The moment I listened to your voice mail , I knew exactly the case ! It wa almost like it wa yesterday . ”
 There wa something about the supreme freakishness of the accident that left a lasting impression . For those who came ashore , the experience wa also marked by a feeling of subtly escalating chaos and the pressure to surmount it . McCormack told me that ours wa a story he retold endlessly , often to the younger Coast Guardsmen he wa eventually tasked with training . In it wa a lesson about “ not taking situation that look impossible at face value , ” he said . “ When thing start to go wrong , don ’ t panic or lose sight of what resource you ’ ve got. ” Keep working the problem until it absolute end — even , McCormack added , if it mean deviating from official policy .


 McCormack wa not supposed to be landing an inflatable boat on an unforgivably rocky Alaskan shoreline , for example . But there he wa , anyway , beaching the Zodiac a gingerly a he could , so that Roberts and the other men could load Jon aboard . They slid him in on his side “ like a folder into a filing cabinet , ” a Jon put it , and started motoring through the chop , very cautiously , back to the Mustang , about a mile away .
 As relieved a Jon had been when the Coast Guard first arrived , he also felt instantaneously more vulnerable . Strapped to the back board , his neck in the collar , he surrendered control of his body , however imperfect that control had been . He wa being hauled around a an object now , with no ability to wriggle or shift position , to manage his pain or even to turn his head and see what wa happening . He wa helpless , entirely dependent on the upright people operating around him , those voice he could hear discussing him on the far side of some gauzy divide . About 10 minute into the trip on the Zodiac , Jon heard one of those voice say , “ Oh , shit , we ’ re losing air . ”
 A section of the Zodiac ’ s sponson — the inflatable fender that wrap around the boat — had punctured . One side wa completely deflated . “ It ’ s a big deal , ” McCormack recently explained to me , sounding surprised that I had to ask . The sponson increase the boat ’ s buoyancy and stability , a well a keeping water from cresting over the side ; under normal condition , a Zodiac with a broken sponson would have been taken out of service automatically . Instead , McCormack found the puncture and wedged the nozzle of a small pump inside . Then — steering the boat with one hand , operating the throttle with the other — he started working the pump with his foot , essentially doing leg press , to keep the fender partly inflated . The ride wa already bumpy in four-foot sea . Now McCormack began tracing a slow , zigzagging course , doing what he could to tamp down the turbulence and the violence to Jon ’ s spine , a well a to guard against the possibility of the injured man ’ s suddenly bounding over the side on his backboard .
 Roberts and the other Coast Guardsmen on the Zodiac leaned over Jon to shield him from the splash . The pain wa heinous ; Jon seemed to be passing out . Roberts talked to him , held his hand . Roberts felt crushed , he told me ; he wa torturing this guy in order to save him . When they finally reached the Mustang , rather than hoist Jon off the Zodiac , they swung the ship ’ s crane around and simply lifted the entire boat out of the water , level with the deck , and then carried him aboard , to keep from joggling him any more .
 McCormack eventually returned for me and Dave , and a half-hour later we were reunited with Jon in the Mustang ’ s athwartship passageway , a cramped , steel hallway , like the space between two car of a train . Jon wa still battened to the backboard , wedged up to keep the weight of his body on his less-painful side . They had cut off his clothes , though he ’ d murmured a plea not to — he wa wearing a brand-new Patagonia jacket that he had borrowed from a friend — then swaddled him in a hypothermia blanket . Dave and I knelt and rubbed his foot .
 The helicopter wa going to make it . I don ’ t remember there being a grand announcement . I ’ m not sure we were ever made aware of the possibility that it wouldn ’ t . Now the crew got busy below : tying down anything that could be blown off by the rotor wash or stashing it in the mess . I also don ’ t remember hearing the helicopter when it finally arrived . Instead , I remember only a heavy door to our left swinging open to reveal , like a scene from an action movie , the silhouette of a man in a blue flight suit , foot planted shoulder-width apart to steady himself a the ship rocked sideways . The cable he ’ d been lowered on drew back into the ocean spray and fog behind him . “ I ’ m flight surgeon Russ Bowman , ” he said and stepped inside .
 Bowman took Jon ’ s vitals and gave him several , successive shot of morphine . Soon , everyone wa working to squeeze him back through the narrow doorway and onto the deck where the helicopter , an MH-60 Jayhawk , wa idling overhead .
 Until recently , the story I told about the accident unfolded in two basic act : the tree fell , instantaneously unleashing a kind of unfathomable chaos ; then the Coast Guard appeared and , just a swiftly , regathered that chaos into order . It wa like watching footage of an exploding object , then watching it run in reverse . The maneuver the Coast Guard wa readying to execute now , on the deck of the Mustang , would be the climax of that progression .
 The helicopter hovered 30 or 40 foot over the boat , mirroring it speed and trajectory , while both vehicle moved slowly forward . “ Looks like you ’ re heading for a rain squall , ” the co-pilot , Chris Ferguson , radioed the Mustang at one point , and asked the ship to adjust it course , to keep them in a forgiving weather a possible . Soon the flight mechanic wa calling out instruction to tuck the aircraft into alignment : “ Forward and right 30 . Forward and right 20 . Forward and right 10. ” Then , finally — speaking , in the flight recording , with an almost galling air of imperturbability — the lead helicopter pilot , Rich McIntyre , radioed the flight mechanic to begin the hoist .
 The whole procedure , from our vantage point , seemed seamless and routine . In a way , it wa : After the agonized deliberation at the air station , the pilot exited off their GPS route into fairly manageable condition around Inian Pass . The wind were workable ; the water wasn ’ t excessively choppy . Ultimately , scooping Jon off the deck of the Mustang would resemble a standard exercise that the pilot drilled in their training . “ Not to dumb it down , ” the co-pilot , Chris Ferguson , told me — plucking someone with a spinal injury off a moving boat and hoisting them into a moving helicopter is a pretty insane thing to do . “ But we normalize what isn ’ t normal . ”
 A few moment earlier , a the men scurried around Jon on his backboard , packaging and fastening him for the hoist , Jon worried that the second he got airborne he would start twirling uncontrollably , like the feathery end of a cat toy , and potentially thwack his head on the equipment on deck . But now , he wa levitating smoothly — a solitary , swaddled bale of a man , perfectly perpendicular to the ground . Dave and I watched it happen : our friend rising steadily away from u , improbably , to safety . As Jon floated higher , he could hear the Coast Guardsmen on the Mustang beneath him begin to cheer . He felt it wa safe to open his eye . When he did , he saw someone , hunched in the open cargo door of the helicopter , pointing a television camera at him .
 Jon wa rushed into surgery at the hospital in Sitka that evening . He ’ d punctured both lung , one to the point of collapse , sustained multiple fracture on eight of his rib , broken several vertebra , shattered his left shoulder blade and snapped his brachial plexus nerve . His spleen had been macerated into countless fleck . After awakening from surgery , Jon wa disappointed that the doctor had swept those shard into a bag and thrown his spleen in the trash ; he wanted to get a look at it , maybe even keep it preserved in a jar , alongside his cyborg-banana .
 Once back in Gustavus , Dave and I realized that we would need to call Jon ’ s parent in Switzerland . I didn ’ t have to push the job on Dave this time ; he wa adamant . He felt he would need to face conversation like these if he wa going to be a doctor . It wa Jon ’ s father who picked up , and after absorbing the news , he paused and caught Dave off guard . “ Thank you , ” he said solemnly . “ You guy saved my son ’ s life . ”
 Dave ’ s stomach dropped . “ I remember thinking about it , ” he told me recently , “ and realizing , Yeah . I guess , logistically , we did. ” I had the same reaction when Dave hung up the phone and , clearly shaken , relayed his conversation to me . Until that moment , the idea that we saved Jon ’ s life had never occurred to u , possibly because the idea that Jon might have died still hadn ’ t occurred to u . We had zero sense of accomplishment , or even agency . In our mind , all we did wa avoid screwing up until the real help could arrive and save him .
 But Jon hadn ’ t absorbed the story that way . From the instant he willed himself out of the water , he felt all of u locking into that same seamless flow of order steadily displacing chaos that Dave and I only experienced once the Coast Guard arrived . It wa amazing to him how the three of u managed to generate solution for each successive problem . Even my reciting those poem , which to me had always felt like a moment of utter helplessness , became , in Jon ’ s telling , a perfect emblem of that streak of serendipitous problem-solving . “ You conveyed a calmness , ” he told me recently . “ I remember it being this nice moment. ” He added that if he ever ha to spend two hour dying on a remote forest floor again , having me there to recite poetry would be one of his top way to do it .
 The feeling of inevitability that day became only more pronounced for Jon a time passed and the entire story of our rescue receded into a prologue to the rest of his life . The surgery in Sitka wa only the first of half a dozen , and it would take several year for him to regain 60 percent of the use of his arm , wrist and hand , a the nerve gradually regrew along his injured side . He wa in good enough shape to go back to Alaska the summer after the accident — repairing boat in the company ’ s warehouse and occasionally helping out at the bed-and-breakfast — but he struggled . He could repair kayak but needed help lifting them . He wa unable to wrestle the mattress corner into the fitted sheet when he made the bed . After that , he started working at a recording studio in Portland , just a he envisioned while stuck in the water , and he now run his own audio-mastering company : Spleenless Mastering .
 Eventually Jon seemed to have recovered from the accident without any conspicuous disability . But his life ha been quietly corroded by chronic pain and , almost equally , by the stress of navigating the doctor , medication ( and their side effect ) to manage it . About two year after the accident , he learned he had PTSD . The trauma wasn ’ t the falling tree , but his experience of powerlessness a a perpetual patient in the American medical system . It manifested a a kind of unbearable empathy for anyone who wa suffering . Jon found himself shouting at doctor , on his own behalf but also on behalf of stranger in waiting room who weren ’ t being seen . He would hear interview with natural-disaster victim or the homeless on NPR and have to pull his car over . There continued to be other tribulation , too — more mundane one . A few time a year , he still rebreaks a rib out of nowhere ; once or twice , Jon told me , all it ha taken is an especially affectionate hug from his wife .
 Jon found early on that he could cordon off this suffering , both in his own mind and in conversation , by making joke about the accident itself and sticking to the happy ending of our rescue , a trick that got much easier after the National Geographic show aired later that year . “ Mission Rescue : Final Frontier , ” the program wa called . The soundtrack wa all heart-thwacking synth drum and shredding guitar . A foreboding , Ken Burns-effected snapshot of Dave and Jon looking joyful before the trip gave way to a whirring re-enactment of someone else ’ s leg — cast in the role of Dave ’ s leg — sprinting through the blurry wood for our radio . A melodramatic narrator pondered the fate of “ Kayaker Jon Cohrs . ”
 Initially , the schlockiness of the production felt like a blessing . The show depersonalized the accident , giving u all a shorthand to convey how dramatic that day had been , without confronting how destabilizing and senseless it might have felt . At a party , you could lay out the basic — a tree fell on Jon — then say , “ National Geographic even made a TV special about it , ” and everyone would go wide-eyed but then move on , figuring you would unspool the real story some other time .
 But we never realized the degree to which that kitschy shorthand started to obscure the real story — then , gradually , to replace it . I ’ m embarrassed to admit that , though Jon and I have remained close , I did not know the extent to which he ha continued to suffer for the last 17 year until talking to him for several hour in order to write this account .
 The morning after the accident , Dave and I traveled back to Dundas Bay to pack up our campsite and collect the kayak we abandoned the previous evening . We were shuttled there from Gustavus by the same boat captain who dropped u off three day earlier , a forbiddingly taciturn commercial fisherman named Doug Ogilvy .
 The tide in the cove wa way out when we arrived ; it wa , a Ogilvy put it , “ a suck-ass beach. ” The approach wa so shallow that he had to drop anchor a hundred yard or more from shore . He asked if we had wader . We did not . So Ogilvy put on his , climbed down the ladder and told Dave to get on his back . Then stoically , like an ox or an old-timey strongman hauling a safe , he trudged through the thigh-high water , dropped Dave on the gravel beach , then lurched back and hauled me the same way , a if I were a man-size infant in a papoose .
 Dave told me he ’ d had a strange feeling on the ride out , a if we would discover that an even more massive tree had fallen on our tent since we last slept there and that all three of u would have been crushed and killed if we ’ d spent another night in Dundas Bay , a planned . That is , he half-expected to find evidence that the accident had been fortuitous somehow , that there wa a reason , or redemptive value , behind it . My mother had the same instinct when I called her the night before . On the phone I strained to emphasize for her — she wa only two year into her cruelly premature widowhood , and I wa new at being the overprotective son of a widow — that Jon wa going to be all right , and that Dave and I were safe . She told me that my dad must have been up there looking out for u somehow .
 I resented all the supernatural thinking . If it comforted other people , fine , but I ’ d somehow known right away that I didn ’ t need a reason for the accident . It wa senseless , but straightforward , a unequivocal a fact a my father ’ s death had been . A tree fell in the wood . It might not have , but it did . Jon could have died , but he didn ’ t . Other possibility spiraled infinitely outward from there , though apparently I wasn ’ t too interested in contemplating them . As strange a it sound , it wa year before I realized that the tree could have hit me — and only after a friend pointed this out , a I told the story around a fire one night . And it wa only a few week ago , while on the phone with Jon , that it occurred to me that the tree could have hit all three of u — we were standing in a single-file line , after all , waiting to cross the creek — and that we all might have wound up clobbered and scattered in that river , dying slowly and watching each other die .
 It ’ s also probably true that I helped preclude these possibility by being so feverishly paranoid about bear , wheeling around at the sound of the snapping root . That ’ s what allowed me to see the tree coming , just barely , and scream that infinitesimal heads-up for Dave . And so , the real meaning of the accident , if I felt compelled to find one , might be that it validated my most exaggerated fear . But instead , it somehow helped cleanse me of them . There wa comfort for me in accepting the arbitrariness of what happened , in regarding it a a spasm of random damage in time and space that , just a randomly , a small number of human being got the opportunity to repair . We were more capable than I had understood . We were also far more helpless .
 On the ride back to Gustavus with our gear , I pictured myself , again , a a small blip in empty space . The ride wa rough and jumpy a Ogilvy impatiently pounded his boat through the last vestigial wave energy of the storm ; Dave and I had to hold on , to plant ourselves on the bench behind him . But there wa a moment when I felt so safe that I loosened my grip , leaned slightly into the motion of the boat , and , closing my eye , felt myself lift off the seat .

 Tell your fellow american that you plan to cross the United States by train , and their reaction will range from amusement at your spellbinding eccentricity to naked horror that they , through some fatal social miscalculation , have become acquainted with a person who would plan to cross the United States by train . Depending how you slice it — time or money — there are either 61 or 960 immediate reason not to travel by Amtrak train from New York City to Los Angeles . Those are the extra hour and dollar , respectively , that you might reasonably expect to forfeit if you forgo a six-hour $ 129 nonstop flight and opt instead for an Amtrak sleeper car . Covering the interjacent 2,448.8 mile can easily consume some 67 hour for a mind-boggling $ 1,089 .
 Of course , you might remind your quote-unquote fellow , any form of modern engine-based transport , even Amtrak , is preposterously fast compared with the method that Homo sapiens employed to move ourselves and , more important , our tchotchke for most of our specie ’ 300,000-year history , which is walking . Crossing the stretch of land where roughly half the Donner party starved , froze or , in the case of the group ’ s two Miwok guide , were shot to death for food — an overland journey that took the party about five month to complete in 1847 — could be done in under two hour by a Honda Accord today , assuming normal traffic , while a plane from Springfield , Ill. , their starting point , to Sacramento would zoom over their whole route in half a day , including layover . Because of this ability to effectively teleport between location , 21st-century Americans have become flippant about transcontinental voyaging . To truly appreciate the size of the landmass ( the third-largest country in the world by land area ) and the variety of it terrain ( rain forest , desert , prairie , Margaritaville , etc . ) , you have to see it from the ground .
 Amtrak cling to the hope that someday people will view it service not a something that suck and that they hate , but a something that is actually nice and that they don ’ t hate . There ’ s a whole separate Amtrak website dedicated to this dream ( AmtrakVacations.com ) , where Amtrak doe thing like describe Los Angeles to people who have never heard of it . “ The ‘ City of Angels ’ is one of the premier attraction in sunny Southern California. ” But the other selling point of a cross-country train trip is a chance to look behind the American scrim : to learn where the nation make and store the hidden part that run it , to find new place you wish you had been born , to spy on backyard and high school football field whose possible existence had never occurred to you . Or me . Why not me ? My boyfriend and I were planning a short vacation out West anyway . I could just leave a few day before him and get there after he arrived .
 As I quickly learned , there are no passenger rail route that cross the entire United States in a single trip , nor are there likely to be any soon . Even proponent of the high-speed railway system much lauded in Asia and Europe ( and tentatively proposed in Congress ’ s Green New Deal resolution ) generally give the competitive edge to plane for travel across distance greater than 600 mile . At present , reaching California by rail from New York requires at least two train , one of which will depart from New Orleans or Chicago , all of which , like most line operated by Amtrak , have name so sumptuously picturesque ( Maple Leaf , Coast Starlight , Sunset Limited ) they make the storybook “ Polar Express ” sound a sterile a “ Amtrak ” by comparison . To book ticket , a person must first complete a battery of test measuring her patience , hand-eye coordination and aptitude for deductive mathematical reasoning , in the guise of Amtrak ’ s impossible-to-use online trip planner . ( While the trip planner can not identify the train station nearest to an address , or even a city , it can tell you the name of the city you have already typed into it search bar , provided there is an Amtrak train station there . ) The fastest way to complete this slow journey is to take the Lake Shore Limited to Chicago ’ s Union Station , then board the Southwest Chief to Los Angeles , one of sunny Southern California ’ s much-hyped premier attraction .
 Contrary to multiple acquaintance ’ declaration that I would encounter “ some real weirdo ” on the train , the first person I met on board my first sleeper car after boarding the train in Penn Station wa a man in a sparkly cardigan and leather pant who breezily identified himself a “ a prophet , ” which is perhaps the world ’ s second-oldest profession . And forgive me if I find nothing “ weird ” about being gainfully employed under a supervisor with the kind of multinational name recognition God ha .
 As he doubtless expected , the prophet and I were in opposite Viewliner roomette — private compartment Amtrak describes a “ designed for one or two passenger , ” although a roomette is both narrower and shorter than a standard porta potty . What Amtrak ha managed to cram into this minuscule space is impressive : a fold-down sink , two cushioned bench that convert to a bed , a second premade bed that lower from the ceiling , a tiny foldout table with an inset of alternating colored square for checker or chess , a coat hook , a luggage cubby , a large picture window and the largest variety of not-quite-matching shade of dark blue upholstery fabric ever assembled . There is even a small metal toilet covered with a puce-colored lid , which invite the brainteaser : Is it more luxurious to have a private toilet inch away from your sleeping area , or a shared toilet elsewhere ?
 The prophet sat silently in his compartment with the curtain open .
 [ See a voyage by train through Nigeria . ]
 The car ’ s friendly attendant advised me that the recommended way to enter the upper berth wa to step first atop the toilet seat ( a little over a foot off the ground ) , then , using a wall-mounted handle for balance , climb onto the narrow built-in ledge above the toilet , rotate my body 90 degree and , fueled by a cocktail of optimism and derring-do , launch myself into the bed suspended in midair . To prevent occupant from rolling off their 28-inch-wide mattress ( the same width a a standard casket ) and falling several foot to the floor , stowed beneath the mattress of every upper bunk is a kind of net of seatbelt that hook with grim determination into the ceiling . Once on the bed , I subjected my body to a series of Cirque du Soleil-inspired experiment to confirm that this safety web would indeed hold my weight , were I to roll unconsciously into it at 2 a.m . I tested the strength of the strap with one leg . I rolled from the wall into the net , flopping my limb . I placed each hand on a segment of net and pushed against it with the full force of my upper body , something that I had never done in my sleep but that now seemed possible or even probable . It seemed secure .
 It also seemed representative of Amtrak ’ s casual , makeshift approach to passenger — a slightly refreshing , slightly unnerving attitude to encounter after a lifetime of air travel . The freedom to move about in a train evokes an illicit , almost danger-courting autonomy . ( The nonprofit National Safety Council report that a person in the United States is several time more likely to die of “ sharp object ” than a plane or train crash , though the event that preceded the recent emergency Boeing grounding make such statistic cold comfort . )
 The instruction given by conductor and attendant were not so much formulaic a they were desperately obvious — a black comic litany of bare-minimum survival tip . “ Just for your safety please do not walk or play on these track , ” went one announcement . Another asked parent to ensure young child did not “ wander around the train alone. ” Although there wa no whiff of a T.S.A . screening in place ( it would presumably be possible for someone to arrive one minute before departure carrying a duffel bag of uranium and sword and hop right on , although hopefully no one will ) , pantomime of security distributed responsibility among everyone aboard . “ WE ’ RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER ... LITERALLY ” read the text on a safety brochure promoting Amtrak ’ s “ If You See Something , Say Something ” campaign .
 Even on short plane trip , every passenger is offered the kindergartner ’ s communion of juice and cooky , a if a majority of adult are incapable of going 90 minute without such provision . On train , passenger are treated a individual even more powerful than adult : independent teenager who just want to smoke . Amtrak know you want to smoke . Amtrak know you love to smoke . But while you ’ re living under Amtrak ’ s roof , you have to follow the rule , of which there is only one , and that is : Don ’ t smoke inside .
 “ Albany is going to be a smoke break , ” a young male voice declared over the intercom a the train hurtled northward . “ Just a reminder , lady and gentleman , ” a voice like that of a female jazz radio D.J . warned on a westbound train . “ This is a completely nonsmoking train. ” She added : “ Your first official stop for a smoke break is Kansas City , Mo . ”
 In winter , the 3:40 Lake Shore Limited experience just 90 minute of daylight before darkness descends for a majority of it journey west to Chicago . The first leg of the trip follows the Hudson River , revealing glimpse of hidden island and idyllic ruin — like the crumbling remains of a fanciful 20th-century castle built by an arm dealer in need of an out-of-the-way place to stash his store of live ammunition , some of which eventually exploded , creating the crumbling remains . At sunset , when all that wa left of the day wa a tangelo slash along the horizon , that same color flashed up from partly melted ice crater that caught the light a the train chugged past . Suddenly , the air outside the train became crow — thousand of crow , rushing in from all angle and alighting on the blue-white frozen river , a if deposited there by an unseen hand .
 Sleep the first night came easily and , a it wa interrupted several time , frequently . After performing the traditional nighttime ritual of climbing atop the toilet and carefully catapulting into bed , I wa rewarded with the gentle rocking of a hammock experiencing a constant minor earthquake tremor . The atmosphere on board wa librarylike ; even the periodic train whistle sounded very far away , a if in someone else ’ s dream .
 [ How to spend 47 hour on a train and not go crazy . ]
 The most unifying characteristic of my fellow passenger wa not age ( although , a a rule , the sleeping car skewed retired ) , race ( very mixed ) , income ( while sleeper are astronomically priced , coach seat can be downright economical for shorter segment ) or even fear of flying ( no one I spoke to had it ) ; it wa their relaxed , easygoing , train-lulled contentment . To opt to travel long distance via Amtrak — a method deemed “ on time ” just 71.2 percent of the time by it own generous metric — is to say : As long a I get there eventually , I ’ m satisfied .
 Train people are content to stare out the window for hour , like indoor cat . The trouble with the Lake Shore Limited is that the amount of enjoyment it is possible to derive from staring out the window of a train is inversely proportional to the population density of the land you are traversing . People need thing , and unfortunately most of those thing are ugly to look at . Many of them are gray . Views picked up considerably when , after a five-hour layover in Chicago , I transferred onto the Southwest Chief , a double-decker “ Superliner ” with many of it coach seat , sleeping quarter and lounge on the top level . Sightseer Lounges are the crown jewel of Amtrak ’ s long-distance train : entire car of retro-futuristic curved floor-to-ceiling window where passenger can sit at table or outward-facing upholstered chair and watch the scenery streak by . Shortly into it route , the Chief pass the single best thing in the United States : a silo in Mendota , Ill. , with an 80-by-20-foot ear of corn painted on one side .
 Train people are also individual for whom small talk is a invigorating a a rail of cocaine . For them , every meal on board Amtrak ( communal seating like a Benihana , reservation only , included with the price of a sleeping-car ticket , check in with the dining-car attendant ) is a rager . A white middle-aged man in motorcycle gear discussed leukemia treatment with a swish black grandmother . Another man , while gathering up armful of research book from a table , bid farewell to a farmer and suggested that he might run into him on the same train next year . I wa seated at dinner with an Amish couple traveling to Arizona for a construction job , and by the time our Amtrak Signature Steaks with optional Béarnaise sauce arrived ( the food is on a par with the fourth-best airplane meal you could ever imagine ) , we were deep in a conversation about one of my favorite topic , which is myself . I offered a tip I ’ d learned about cleaning up glitter using dryer sheet , and they laughed a they tried to envision a situation in which this information could ever be useful .
 “ ‘ Who told you that ? ’ ” the husband asked himself , anticipating companion ’ question . “ ‘ Some girl that writes in The New York Times ! ’ ”
 “ They ’ d never believe u , ” mused his wife , who had ordered cheesecake for dinner .
 At another meal , my table mate were a Missouri-based retired physician and her husband , a retired special-ed teacher , plus a retired architect from Arizona who wa traveling alone . In the middle of a conversation about how they met their spouse , the architect suddenly seemed preoccupied with his iPhone . “ I read one where it said , ” he muttered into his chest , “ ‘ Keep your photo of your wife when you met her. ’ ” He lifted the phone and showed the table his lock screen : a black-and-white photo of a beautiful young woman in 1960s dress . I barely managed not to cry into my Land & Sea entree ( Amtrak Signature Steak with optional Béarnaise sauce , plus additional crab , shrimp and scallop cake ) .
 Back in my warm little room , there wa something I couldn ’ t put my finger on that made it subtly nicer than my Lake Shore Limited accommodation , and that wa the in-room toilet , because this roomette did not have one . I had been given a stationary pointing tour of the compartment by the Chief ’ s sleeping-car attendant — a middle-aged woman from a small town in Mexico , who , like every Amtrak attendant with whom I interacted over the course of three day , hummed along with the unflustered friendliness of a benevolent spirit continuing to go about it business in a hotel decade after the property ha been converted into luxury condo . Her soothing voice made everything she said sound like the hurried recitation of a familiar recipe . Her assessment of me — “ You are on vacation , you probably want to close the curtain and sleep and sleep , wake up and eat and then go and take another nap , it ’ s O.K. , that ’ s why you are on vacation ” — wa delivered all in one breath .
 Kansas share a border with Colorado . I never could have imagined that I would one day say this , and I know many people will be disconcerted by the statement . They will wonder if , this whole time , they have been reading an avant-garde work of science fiction , or perhaps a Mad Lib . “ Is magical realism always this scary ? ” they will ask themselves . Some will claim I am lying . Many will assume I am wrong , demented or a clumsy typist .
 To all of whom I respond : The truth of our nation ’ s internal demarcation is stranger than fiction — stranger than even the kind of brilliant avant-garde science fiction I am most likely capable of producing yet choose not to . But the unvarnished fact is Colorado ha to start somewhere , and for whatever reason , that ’ s inside Kansas .
 I woke in Colorado to a weather phenomenon called the pogonip — freezing fog that condensed on tree limb and sagebrush until they looked dusted with powdered sugar . The terrain of the Colorado tableland is so flat that it seemed possible to detect the exact location where the pogonip ended and blue sky began , the margin of the changing landscape revealing themselves a definitively a gutter between panel of a newspaper comic .
 A childlike compulsion to identify distant cow rippled through the observation car a we hurried along . So fast did we fly past baby deer that the “ aw ! ” s caught in our throat . Whichever way you face , you are privy to an all-day show , although there is a nagging sensation that by being focused in one direction , you are missing something spectacular unfolding in another . Sometimes you are . Sometimes other people will even tell you you are , like when a grizzled stranger sat down next to me , close enough to be way too close , jerked his head behind u , growled , “ That ’ s Pikes Peak ” and walked away . Unknown to me , on the north side of the train , the Rockies had just begun to loom up out of the prairie .
 Azure and golden orange were the color of the afternoon . Action-movie poster are dominated by this color combination , famous for it vibrancy , and indeed , a horizon filled with just these hue seemed to draw the Sightseer Lounge into a kind of trance . For a long while there wa nothing but sky and earth to observe — I saw actual tumbleweed somersault by — yet everyone , me included , remained riveted to the window . It wa possible , in the Sightseer Lounge , to watch weather roll in from a great distance , even from one side of the car to the other . As we ascended hill covered in pinyon and juniper , flake began to fall , and soon we were in a winter forest . As quickly a we had entered the snowscape , however , we were back in dusty New Mexican grassland , rolling through a hailstorm of white bird .
 Sunset pushed the denizen of the Sightseer Lounge to the brink of insanity , a all but the Amish frantically tried to capture the flame-colored sky on our cellphone camera . A companionable mother I met earlier in the day , accompanying her own parent on a casino trip to Nevada , dashed from another car to make sure I wa facing out of the best side of the lounge to photograph the heaven . When the sun dipped below the horizon , the sky turned the color of wet slate , then dark denim blue with a pale apricot smear that we chased west for several mile .
 Scale on a rail trip is what ’ s most arresting . We live so much of our life close-up — scrolling through phone , watching our type appear on computer screen , scrutinizing paper , preparing meal , cleaning our home room by room . Very few element of our day-to-day task remain out of arm ’ reach . An extended train ride affords a chance not just to see a horizon but also to soak it up . To luxuriate in the far-off for uninterrupted hour . To exist , briefly , in the uncharted section of the cellphone-coverage map .
 And it feel a if you ’ re getting away with something — seeing more than you deserve . The best part of the trip wasn ’ t spying on the backyard of house ; it wa out here , in the open . The bright hue of the nation ’ s choropleth population-density map fade to white in these area , yet many of the most beautiful habitable part of the United States , no offense to Boston , are contained within those colorless expanse . Amtrak take advantage of this circumstance . It is fortunate that it route were laid during a period of industrious optimism , when everyone assumed the West would soon be made a unbearable a the East ; if they had known it would remain beautiful , it would have been difficult to justify the financial investment .
 Lying in my berth , I felt a happy a an egg in an incubator with no plan to hatch . My mood wa so upbeat that when I spotted a vitamin on the carpet , I optimistically assumed it wa the one I ’ d been keeping in my pocket for week but forgetting to take , and I popped it in my mouth , reminding myself to look up the writing stamped on it later . It turned out to have been a supplement for adult 50 and over . I had become train-lulled .
 When I awoke on the third day , we were about an hour behind schedule . It had happened , our attendant explained , when assistance for a handicapped passenger wa slow to arrive at an overnight stop . “ We can ’ t rush them ! ” she chided ( referring , presumably , to the passenger rather than the assistance ) , though delay appeared to have dampened no mood ; it meant that the sun rose over the San Bernardino Mountains at breakfast . As we approached our final destination , the scenery deteriorated , the red rock vista replaced by heap of wooden pallet stacked in strip-mall parking lot . When we pulled into the last stop on the line , the train wa almost empty . I had surveyed thousand of mile of panoramic splendor , and I couldn ’ t believe I had come all that way just to get to Los Angeles .
