 One thing we learn in “ Captain Marvel ” is that it ’ s pronounced MarVELL , like the English poet — or at least it used to be , on distant planet and right here on Earth , a windy rock also known a C-53 . That wa back in 1995 , when most of this movie take place and when the world a we know it had not yet been colonized by the Marvel Cinematic Universe . Yes , of course , Marvel Comics had been around for decade , but when the heroine crash through the roof of the Blockbuster Video store , landing in between the “ Family ” and “ Drama ” section , there are no Avengers or Iron-Man title on the shelf .
 Instead , she pick up a VHS box of “ The Right Stuff , ” which earns a mild chuckle , since while we know that she ’ s a space alien named Vers ( rhyme with “ cheer ” ) , we also have reason to suspect that this young woman is connected with the United States Air Force , and maybe the space program , too , like the guy in that film . Also known a Carol Danvers , and played by Brie Larson , she ha some of their bravado , and also — since she ’ s on the way to intergalactic superheroism — a righteous sense of mission and a burgeoning identity crisis .
 [ Captain Marvel ha had many , many identity in the comic . ]
 The last and least surprising thing we learn about her is that “ Captain Marvel will return in ‘ Avengers : Endgame , ’ ” a scrappy little picture that will be released in seven week , if you can stand to wait that long . Directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck from a script they wrote with Geneva Robertson-Dworet , “ Captain Marvel ” is an origin story , which is to say a résumé check for the newest member of popular culture ’ s biggest , most heavily capitalized corporate team .
 As such , it ’ s pretty good fun , and could almost be described without sarcasm a a scrappy little picture , like most of Boden and Fleck ’ s other work . ( Their résumé includes “ Half Nelson , '' “ Sugar ” and “ It ’ s Kind of a Funny Story ” ) . It ’ s not too long , not too self-important , and benefit from the craft and talent of a cast that includes Annette Bening , Jude Law and Ben Mendelsohn .
 And of course Samuel L. Jackson , who play a young , two-eyed S.H.I.E.L.D . agent named Nicholas Fury . How Fury lost one of those eye is the big spoiler to avoid here , and the character ’ s extended presence , after so many agitated cameo over the year , is a big part of the movie ’ s appeal . To watch the digitally rejuvenated Jackson riding around mid-90s Los Angeles , sort of like he did in “ Pulp Fiction , ” is to indulge in a bit of Gen-X nostalgia , a mood augmented by period-appropriate musical cue from Salt-N-Pepa , TLC and Nirvana .
 [ Can ‘ Captain Marvel ’ fix Marvel ’ s woman problem ? ]
 There are pay phone and pager , too , and boxy government car and all kind of stuff that kid these day just don ’ t appreciate . Even the science-fiction element have a mildly retro , “ Star Trek : The Next Generation ” feel . And the overall vibe , for all the fireball and fisticuffs , is decidedly friendly . In addition to the Vers/Fury buddy-movie pairing , there is a best friend for Carol ( a fellow pilot named Maria Rambeau , played by Lashana Lynch ) and a succession of frenemies . Best of all , there is an orange cat . I will never hate a movie with an orange cat .
 The plot of “ Captain Marvel , ” for some reason , is another secret I ’ m supposed to keep . Which is fine . In spite of what some unhinged fan on social medium might say , I wa not paid by Disney to explain anything . Boden and Fleck were , and they do a perfectly adequate job . There ’ s a big war going on between the Kree — Vers ’ s people , at least a far a she know — and the Skrull , green-skinned , pointy-eared being who have the unnerving skill of turning into doppelgängers of anyone they see . Annette Bening is involved . We first see her a a manifestation of Supreme Intelligence , which seems accurate enough . I ’ ll say no more .
 The twist in the story reveal a slyly anti-imperialist politics , which is both in keeping with the pluralist ethic of the Avengers cycle and just a bit subversive of the Disney-Marvel agenda of universal domination . The most sympathetic group of character want nothing more than to go somewhere else , to escape from the annihilating attention of their would-be conqueror . They might represent various oppressed and dispossessed earthly population . They might also stand in for that portion of the movie audience that feel the cinematic universe shrinking around them .
 Not that anyone can stop the Marvel Cinematic Universe from expanding . By now the contradiction of this gigantic enterprise are obvious enough . It ’ s inclusive and monopolistic , predatory and empowering . Every episode is unique — every hero is a complex individual with a singular back story — within an overall structure of sameness .
 Filmmakers like Boden and Fleck , Ryan Coogler and Taika Waititi can put their own spin on a given story or hero , but at some point bolt or wave of orange or blue light will come shooting out of someone ’ s hand and someone else will be thrown backward and bounce off a wall . The protagonist ’ s costume will become a character in it own right . That protagonist — a tough and charming woman , in this case , determined to fight gender clichés at least to a draw — will be ready for a career of franchise clock-punching , along with the rest of u . You will stay through the very last credit in the hope of collecting every last Easter egg , and you ’ ll shuffle out of the theater feeling both satisfied and empty .

 When “ Captain Marvel ” open next Friday , it will be a moment of great satisfaction mixed with lingering frustration .
 The film , which star Brie Larson a that spacefaring comic-book superhero , is the 21st entry in the interconnected Marvel movie franchise since it began in 2008 but only the first to focus principally on a woman .
 By now , audience have grown accustomed to superhero movie that put woman in the spotlight . In 2017 , “ Wonder Woman , ” based on DC Comics ’ Amazonian warrior , wa a worldwide hit for Warner Bros .
 Marvel ha built it own fortune on a decades-old supply of costumed adventurer that doesn ’ t lack for woman . And the studio ha been criticized for it slowness to create movie emphasizing it female character .
 So what took Marvel a long a it did to reach this point ? And will “ Captain Marvel ” be the movie that make good on this long unfulfilled potential ?
 [ Mar-Vell explained . | Meet the cat who played Goose in the movie . ]
 The answer to the first question , at least , lie in a tangle of social , cultural and economic factor . They parallel similar issue that Marvel ha faced in making stride toward female representation in it comic book over the past 60 year — effort that gradually helped bring Captain Marvel to prominence in the publisher ’ s pantheon and make the movie more likely .
 The people behind “ Captain Marvel ” — the movie a well a the comic book that inspired it — acknowledge the problematic history that led to these more welcome development .
 They also see opportunity for woman to have an equal place on the page and on the screen , and for the Captain Marvel character to grow a an icon of female representation and empowerment .
 “ What Captain Marvel needed to be when she debuted in the 1960s is very different than what she need to be in 2019 , when she ’ s anchoring a major film , ” said Kelly Thompson , the current author of the Captain Marvel comic book series . “ The film ha her poised to be more important to more people than ever , and comic get to be the proving ground for the character . ”
 Marvel , the Disney-owned home of the Avengers superteam , ha become an important bellwether of diversity in Hollywood . The studio ha broken ground with film like “ Black Panther , ” it 2018 blockbuster with a black director , screenwriter and leading actor .
 In recent year Marvel ha also gained a reputation for giving opportunity to filmmaker who don ’ t have a background in tentpole action movie . That category includes the “ Captain Marvel ” director Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck , who are better known for low-budget offering like “ Mississippi Grind ” and “ It ’ s Kind of a Funny Story . ”
 Recalling an early meeting with Marvel , Boden said they told the studio , “ All we have is the character stuff . And they said , ‘ We know how to explode thing — we need director who can tell a story . ’ ”
 ( “ Captain Marvel , ” written by Boden , Fleck and Geneva Robertson-Dworet , is also the first Marvel movie to have a female director and only the second , after 2014 ’ s “ Guardians of the Galaxy , ” to credit woman a screenwriter . )
 Larson , an Academy Award winner for the 2015 drama “ Room , ” said she wa initially wary when she wa approached for “ Captain Marvel ” and unsure if she wanted to take on such a high-profile role .
 But the actress , who ha called for greater participation by woman and people of color in the film industry and in the medium covering it , said the global rollout of “ Captain Marvel ” could help bring her advocacy to a wider audience .
 She said she felt invested in the moral lesson of her smaller film like “ Short Term 12. ” But when it came to “ Captain Marvel , ” Larson said she asked herself , “ Could I still do the same thing of caring about the content and making sure it ha a message while also playing all over the world ? Being able to shape the conversation is what female leadership look like . ”
 In Captain Marvel ’ s favor , Larson said that while other Marvel hero are weak and lowly at the start of their origin story , “ she wa a badass before she got her power . ”
 A former Air Force test pilot named Carol Danvers , she gain superhuman ability from an alien race , and Boden described the movie a a mystery of sort in which Danvers must investigate her own past .
 “ As she get to know herself and embrace what make her her , she really achieves her true power , ” Boden said . “ Part of that mean rejecting the voice of people who tell her she ’ s not strong enough and doesn ’ t belong . I feel like a lot of people will be able to relate to that , particularly woman . ”

 THE CHARACTER OF CAROL DANVERS ha been on a journey of her own since Marvel introduced her in the comic in 1968 . At the time , she wa not much more than a Lois Lane-type love interest for a male hero ( an extraterrestrial soldier who wa the publisher ’ s original Captain Marvel ) .
 Marvel , where it audacious editor Stan Lee led a roster of talented writer and illustrator , wa celebrated in that era for it inclusivity . But it earliest effort at female representation can now seem like tokenism .
 “ You can ’ t help but think that if Stan Lee wasn ’ t a conscious sexist , he certainly wa so traditional , ” said Heidi MacDonald , editor of The Beat , a comic culture website . “ He gave his female character the weakest power — ‘ Oh , I can get very small. ’ ‘ I can turn invisible. ’ ‘ I can move a teacup with my mind . ’ ”
 In the 1970s and ’ 80 , Marvel put out it first solo female superhero comic and introduced Spider-Woman and She-Hulk , gender-swapped version of it best-known character who were intended , in part , to protect the publisher ’ s copyright .
 In a nod to the growing feminist movement , Marvel transformed Danvers into Ms. Marvel , giving her a solo series in which she battled intergalactic villain and wore a navel-baring costume .
 The character would go in and out of vogue over the year , a period when many woman would drift away from comic . The publication became harder to find at bookstore and newsstand , and female reader were alienated by sexist story line and artwork that reduced woman to sidekick and stereotype .
 “ In the ’ 80 and ’ 90 , we made comic that were actively insulting to woman , ” the writer Kelly Sue DeConnick said . “ Women left in drove . Because why are you going to read stuff that ’ s actively insulting to you , that you have to get at a specialty store where you ’ re not always welcome ? ”
 DeConnick sought to counteract this when she reintroduced Carol Danvers in a 2012 series in which the character finally assumed the title of Captain Marvel and donned a jumpsuit more appropriate to her military background .
 In the preceding year , DeConnick said , “ she had gone from wearing a gymnast ’ s leotard with thigh boot to a thong . It wa the most disingenuous thing in the world . ”
 DeConnick , whose father served in the Air Force for 20 year , said she wanted to inscribe Danvers in the tradition of the pilot ace she ’ d long admired .
 “ I grew up on Air Force base and have a real soft spot for the history of aviation , ” DeConnick said . Citing pilot like Pappy Boyington and Chuck Yeager , she added , “ You can have swagger and you can still be military . ”
 At the same time , female reader were returning to comic , encouraged by new publication format and more inclusive plot and character .
 The revitalized Carol Danvers had become a central player in Marvel ’ s comic universe , and the publisher successfully introduced a diverse array of character like a young new Spider-Man , Miles Morales , who is of black and Puerto Rican descent , and a new Ms. Marvel , Kamala Khan , who is a Muslim teenager .
 Most crucially , said Thompson , the current Captain Marvel author , “ Marvel put their support behind these character . You have to put good talent on their book , but you have to support and advertise for them and push them a premier character . Let ’ s not ignore that part of the equation . ”

 MARVEL ’ S MOVIES , HOWEVER , DID NOT KEEP PACE . The studio ’ s earliest release were focused on establishing core male hero like Iron Man , Captain America and Thor ; though it cinematic universe had included female character like Black Widow ( played by Scarlett Johansson ) and the Scarlet Witch ( Elizabeth Olsen ) a member of larger team , there were no solo film in development for them .
 Even Marvel seemed prey to a longstanding Hollywood fallacy that while woman will watch movie about men , men will not watch movie about woman . “ Because woman are low-status in our culture , ” DeConnick said , “ you will aspire up , you will not cross-identify down . ”
 That perception of the studio appeared to be reinforced by the leak of a 2014 email from Isaac Perlmutter , the chairman of Marvel Entertainment , in which he disparaged female superhero film like “ Supergirl ” ( 1984 ) , “ Catwoman ” ( 2004 ) and “ Elektra ” ( 2005 ) for their poor box-office performance .
 Similarly , when the Marvel studio wa reorganized in 2015 , allowing it president , Kevin Feige , to report directly to Disney and sidestep Perlmutter , industry observer assumed that this gave Feige the freedom to pursue more diverse movie like “ Black Panther ” and “ Captain Marvel. ” ( Marvel and Disney declined to comment on this . )
 Boden and Fleck , the “ Captain Marvel ” director , said it wa difficult to escape the grip of Hollywood tradition , in which most genre movie still focus on male lead .
 “ Even looking at our own film , why did it take u five film to have one about a female protagonist ? ” Fleck said . “ Hopefully we get to the point where these story are being told all the time . ”
 Asked what conclusion he and Boden had reached by reflecting on their own body of work , Fleck replied , “ We haven ’ t arrived at the insight yet . I think they ’ re coming though . ”
 For all of the unresolved question that “ Captain Marvel ” raise , MacDonald , the Beat editor , said that Marvel still deserved credit for getting the movie produced and generating enthusiasm for the character .
 “ There ’ s definitely a lot of history that they had to buck to get ‘ Captain Marvel ’ made , ” she said . “ They built a real basis for this character and a passion for what she stood for ” a well a a fan base that is “ very powerful . ”
 She added , “ Is it million and million of people ? No , it isn ’ t . But it doesn ’ t need to be . It need to be that core , that spark . ”
 There is no expectation that “ Captain Marvel ” will match the monumental box-office result of last year ’ s “ Black Panther , ” which grossed $ 1.3 billion worldwide , or “ Avengers : Infinity War , ” which took in $ 2 billion globally and ended on a catastrophic cliffhanger that fan have waited almost a year to see resolved . By comparison , Marvel ’ s “ Ant-Man and the Wasp , ” a summer 2018 release that starred Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly , had global gross of $ 622 million .
 Recent tracking report estimate that “ Captain Marvel ” will bring in more than $ 100 million in it opening weekend , and MacDonald said the movie will probably appeal to multiple constituency : not only fan of the character and woman who want to watch female-led film , but also Marvel obsessive who want to see how it tie into Marvel ’ s next battle royale , “ Avengers : Endgame , ” which open April 26 .
 “ Kevin Feige is very smart , ” MacDonald said . “ He ’ s releasing the movie that would be the hardest sell in a position where it ’ s going to lead into the greatest final act in movie history . ”
 It ’ s unclear whether “ Captain Marvel ” will be the start of a trend or an outlier for Marvel . Hollywood trade publication have reported that the studio is preparing other female-led project , including a Black Widow movie , starring Johansson and directed by Cate Shortland ( “ Lore ” ) , and a film adaptation of the Eternals , directed by Chloé Zhao ( “ The Rider ” ) . But Disney said it could not confirm Marvel ’ s development slate .
 Whether “ Captain Marvel ” can be a harbinger for other movie like it , Larson said , “ is a larger question , a systemic thing . ”
 “ That change is scary , ” she said , “ and it take time for it to come . It ’ s slow but it ’ s happening . ”
 The only way such progress can happen , Larson said , is if she and her peer use the influence afforded by movie like “ Captain Marvel ” to strive for further change and to make them permanent .
 “ Part of why I ’ m pushing really hard now is because I do have a little bit of power , and I ’ m going to use it , ” she said . “ You don ’ t know when it ’ s going to shift again or who ’ s going to have the power next . But I ’ ll push it a far a I can . Because it ’ s the right thing to do . ”
 An earlier version of this article misstated the kind of boot Captain Marvel wore before the character wa reintroduced in 2012 . In the preceding year , she wore thigh boot , not side boot . The earlier version also misstated which branch of the military Pappy Boyington served in . It wa the Marines , not the Air Force .

 As “ Captain Marvel ” swooped into it second weekend in theater on Friday , the question wasn ’ t really whether it would top domestic ticket sale , but by how much .
 Disney-Marvel can breathe easy . Their latest superhero origin story , the first film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe dedicated to a female superhero , sold an estimated $ 69.3 million in ticket nationwide this weekend , bringing it North American total to around $ 266.2 million .
 That ’ s a higher figure than the lifetime domestic gross of “ Captain America : The Winter Soldier ” ( $ 259.8 million ) , and already make “ Captain Marvel ” the 13th-best-selling film in the current 21-movie Marvel series — with room to grow .
 “ Captain Marvel ” ha done well internationally , too , with $ 120 million in overseas sale this weekend , according to the studio , for a global total of $ 760 million . While the figure aren ’ t earth-shattering , they indicate a solid success for Disney-Marvel .
 [ Read our critic ’ s review of “ Captain Marvel . ” ]
 That success came despite attempt by troll to derail “ Captain Marvel. ” Ahead of it release , the film wa the target of effort at online sabotage by user apparently lashing out against it star , Brie Larson , who ha been outspoken in her support of more diverse representation in Hollywood movie . The campaign prompted the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes to make major change to it longstanding rule , including the elimination of audience review for movie that have not yet been released .
 Free from any targeted online attack wa Paramount ’ s “ Wonder Park , ” an animated family movie about a young girl who dream up plan for an amusement park and see them colorfully brought to life . That movie sold $ 16 million in ticket domestically this weekend , according to Comscore , which compiles box-office data . While a far cry from “ Captain Marvel , ” the figure wa more than enough to land “ Wonder Park ” in second place .
 The only other newcomer in the top five wa Lionsgate and CBS Films ’ s “ Five Feet Apart , ” in third . The movie , about a couple whose shared genetic disorder force them to maintain physical distance from each other despite their growing romance , sold $ 13.2 million in ticket .
 An earlier version of this article omitted the name of a distributor of “ Five Feet Apart. ” The movie is distributed by Lionsgate and CBS Films , not just Lionsgate .

 Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios . Her adventure is set in the 1990s , but the exploit of Captain Marvel date to 1939 , when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and wa granted power by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero . Since then , many men and woman have borne the name Captain Marvel , a well a a sexually fluid alien . Here is a colorful selection .
 In 1939 , Billy Batson , an orphaned newspaper boy , turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam ! No villain could stop him , but a later lawsuit nearly did . National Comics ( the forerunner of DC Comics ) thought Captain Marvel , who wa strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “ Superman , ” wa too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement . Fawcett retired the character in 1953 , but nearly 20 year later , DC licensed him for new comic . Still , the series could not be called Captain Marvel , because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for it own hero in 1966 . These day , Batson go by Shazam ( he can not say his own name lest he transform ) and will get his own film , starring Zachary Levi , next month .

 Bursting on to the scene in 1966 , Mar-Vell started out a a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth . This version of the hero wa originally a silver-haired hunk , but editor feared his hair color made him look old . He wa given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job , leaving him with his better known golden tress . Sadly , he lost his battle with cancer in 1982 . More shockingly , Mar-Vell ha remained dead , despite comic ’ love of resurrection . His genetically engineered son , Genis-Vell , burst onto the scene a Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel , bearing it until he wa killed in 2006 . Spoiler : Mar-Vell ha an unexpected role in the new film .
 In 1967 , Carol Danvers wa introduced a an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel . In 1976 , Danvers became Ms. Marvel , whose costume wa a variation of Mar-Vell ’ s , albeit more revealing . She later lost her memory and power , and alien experiment transformed her to Binary , who get in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woe . Danvers then became Warbird , joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism , before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel ( with an appropriate military-inspired uniform ) .
 Introduced in 1982 , Monica Rambeau worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol . An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy . She joined the Avengers to better understand her ability and excelled , eventually mastering her power and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time . Rambeau wa Captain Marvel for 14 year . She ceded the name to Mar-Vell ’ s son and became Photon ( and , later , Pulsar and Spectrum ) . The “ Captain Marvel ” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau ( played by Lashana Lynch ) , an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who ha a young daughter named Monica .
 This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas , who wa obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their power , and Hexus , a corporation that became sentient ( and evil ) . Noh-Varr joined the Avengers a Captain Marvel and later became known a the Protector . As a space-faring Kree , the triple-jointed Nor-Varr ha a fluid view of sexuality . “ We consider these thing carefully , ” he once told his Young Avengers teammate . “ I wa aboard an exploratory vessel , after all . Exploratory doe have multiple meaning . The Kree are efficient like that . ”
 When her series began in 2014 , Kamala Khan wa a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel . When Khan ’ s power activated , she became the local hero Ms. Marvel , telling her idol in a feverish dream : “ I want to be you . Except I would wear the classic , politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels. ” Since then , Khan ha expanded her reach globally with the Champions , a squad of teenage superheroes , and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day . In the meantime , maybe fan will get a big-screen cameo ? At a news conference last month , Brie Larson wa asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel . “ My dream would be that Ms. Marvel get to come into play , ” she said .
 An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the character Monica Rambeau wa introduced into the Marvel comic universe . It wa 1982 , not 1987 .

 If movie studio needed another reminder that audience are craving for new kind of superpowered hero , they got it this weekend .
 Disney ’ s “ Captain Marvel ” rode a wave of enthusiasm for more diverse superheroes , a hunger for blockbuster at a quiet time of year and a large helping of ’ 90 nostalgia to sell $ 153 million in ticket in U.S. theater over the weekend .
 It wa easily the best stateside debut weekend of any movie this year a it breezily outperformed expectation and brought the domestic box office a much-needed boost .
 The Brie Larson-led movie ’ s opening weekend wa the seventh best of any in the 21-film Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise , behind the $ 174.1 million brought in by “ Iron Man 3 ” and just ahead of “ Guardians of the Galaxy Vol . 2 , ” which made $ 146.5 million during it first weekend . ( Topping that list : “ Avengers : Infinity War , ” which took in $ 257.7 million when it debuted . )
 “ Captain Marvel ” is the first film in the franchise dedicated to the story of a female superhero . DC-Warner Bros. and their Gal Gadot-led “ Wonder Woman ” broke a comic book glass ceiling in 2017 , but “ Captain Marvel ” had an even stronger opening , bringing in over $ 50 million more than “ Wonder Woman , ” which sold around $ 100.5 million in ticket during it opening weekend . While DC-Warner Bros. hired a single woman — Patty Jenkins — to direct “ Wonder Woman , ” Disney-Marvel ’ s movie split directing duty between Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck , who wrote the script with Geneva Robertson-Dworet .
 An origin story whose soundtrack trade in the like of Salt-N-Pepa and Nirvana , “ Captain Marvel ” is set principally in 1990s California , where Larson ’ s hero crash-lands and eventually team up with Nicholas Fury , a government agent familiar to Marvel fan and here played by a younger-looking , digitally rejuvenated Samuel L. Jackson . Ben Mendelsohn , Jude Law , Annette Bening and Lashana Lynch play other major role .
 [ Read our critic ’ s review of “ Captain Marvel . ” ]
 “ Captain Marvel ” received fairly positive review — it currently hold an 80 % “ fresh ” rating on Rotten Tomatoes — but it critical reception hasn ’ t been a strong a some other high-grossing Disney-Marvel entry ( by comparison , “ The Avengers ” hold a 92 % “ fresh ” rating ; “ Captain America : Civil War ” hold 91 % ) . Whether the critic ’ response affect the new movie ’ s staying power remains to be seen , but it strong start is good news for Disney . The studio is also using “ Captain Marvel ” to drive up interest in “ Avengers : Endgame , ” the next entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that ’ s slated for release next month . That film will count Brie Larson ’ s newly-minted character among it ensemble of hero , alongside Chris Evans ’ s Captain America , Robert Downey Jr. ’ s Iron Man , Mark Ruffalo ’ s Hulk , Chadwick Boseman ’ s Black Panther and others in what is essentially the popcorn movie equivalent of a musical supergroup .
 Moviegoers who didn ’ t see “ Captain Marvel ” this weekend mostly picked between two other film . Universal ’ s “ How to Train Your Dragon : The Hidden World , ” now in it third weekend , brought in about $ 14.7 million . And Lionsgate ’ s “ A Madea Family Funeral , ” the swan song of Tyler Perry ’ s long-running title character , sold $ 12.1 million in ticket according to Comscore , which compiles box office data . Other than “ Captain Marvel , ” there were no first-week movie in the top ten .

 LOS ANGELES — About five year ago , Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige found himself on a retreat in Palm Springs plotting the future for the wild , experimental `` cinematic universe '' that he helped start in 2008 . He wanted to do something that they had n't done . He wanted an ending .
 And after a quick pitch to Robert Downey Jr. , he , director Anthony and Joe Russo and screenwriter Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely , started plotting a way to bring this saga to a close , brainstorming whenever they had a moment — even in between take of `` Captain America : Civil War . ''
 Anyone who saw `` Avengers : Infinity War '' know they were n't kidding around either . Thanos literally dissolved half of humanity , including Spider-Man and Black Panther in an event known a `` the snap '' that 's inspired tear , meme and more fan theory than the internet can hold . Talk about a cliffhanger .
 Endings are a rarity in the franchise movie-making business ; especially when one 's popularity ha only multiplied a the movie of Marvel have . But Marvel Studios , which ha never shied away from a little rule-breaking , is taking a sledgehammer to that old `` do n't leave money on the table '' maxim , and audience will finally be able to see how they do it when `` Avengers : Endgame '' open nationwide on April 25 .
 `` ( Ending ) is not a scary word , '' Feige said . `` It 's a necessary word . ''
 What exactly that mean for the Marvel Cinematic Universe ( MCU ) is something of a state secret . Feige said that this will be `` definitive , '' though .
 `` People can debate and discus what that mean before they see the movie , '' Feige said . `` But for u that mean bringing to a conclusion the first three phase , the first 22 film in the MCU , so that everything thereafter is a new start . ''
 So `` new '' in fact that Feige wo n't even discus what 's to come beyond the July release of `` Spider-Man : Far From Home . '' He wo n't confirm reportedly in-the-works project like the `` Black Widow '' stand-alone , `` The Eternals '' or `` Shang-Chi , '' or talk about plan for the 20th Century Fox property like `` Deadpool '' and `` X-Men '' that are now under his purview .
 They have the next five year mapped out ; they 're just not letting audience peek behind the curtain until after `` Endgame . '' It 's that big .
 `` How we leave 'Endgame ' will help define where we 're going for many people , '' Feige said .
 But how doe one talk about a movie that no press ha seen and no actor or creator are allowed to discus in detail ? Well , carefully and cryptically .
 We know some thing . That the hero left like Iron Man ( Downey Jr. ) , Captain America ( Chris Evans ) , Black Widow ( Scarlett Johansson ) , Thor ( Chris Hemsworth ) , Hulk ( Mark Ruffalo ) and War Machine ( Don Cheadle ) are dealing with the devastating loss post-snap while trying to figure out what to do with Thanos . A helpful `` Avenge the Fallen '' campaign served a a reminder of who survived and who did n't ( some of the dusted were even a surprise , like `` Black Panther 's '' Shuri ) . We also know they have a new weapon in Brie Larson 's Captain Marvel , who Samuel L. Jackson 's Nick Fury managed to page before dissolving into dust .
 Will character die , though ? Probably . Will the one lost in `` the snap , '' remain gone ? Unclear ( although some who have upcoming movie , like , say Spider-Man , wo n't ) . But the cast and filmmaker are n't giving anything up , or even commenting on the fact that this might be the last of Evans a Captain America , which the actor himself tweeted about month ago .
 `` I still do n't know what happens in this movie , '' said Larson , who actually even filmed her scene in `` Endgame '' before `` Captain Marvel , '' which came out earlier this year .
 Filming proved an emotional experience for many of the actor , a lot of whom have now been working together for almost a decade or more .
 `` I wa pretty teary-eyed , '' Evans said . `` This is the culmination of a really long endeavor . It kind of wrap up the journey for a lot of these character . ''
 It led to a lot of reflection , about where they started and how they 've grown . Johansson noted that she 'd been developing her character for 10 year now , and is excited that Black Widow ha evolved from a `` sexy secretary '' type to a more fully realized woman .
 `` The whole shoot felt pretty nostalgic , '' Hemsworth added . `` We were constantly talking about when it all started to how we pulled this off and what we were a part of . ''
 But he also admits he wa `` kind of happy to get off the set . '' An eight month shoot can wear even on Thor .
 And indeed the shoot wa grueling . The director , who did `` Winter Soldier , '' `` Civil War '' and `` Infinity War '' said it wa the hardest of their life .
 `` This went far beyond anything we 'd ever done before , '' said Anthony Russo . `` There 's a reason why movie are n't made this way normally . ''
 But that this wa unconventional wa also the draw .
 `` I think the only reason we stuck around , is because they were committed to an ending and we 're deconstructionists , '' said Joe Russo . `` We like to take thing apart and see the ramification of what happens . 'Winter Soldier ' the good guy became the bad guy , 'Civil War , ' we divorced the hero , 'Infinity War , ' we killed half of them . We like to smash it and look at how you can put the piece back together . ''
 And no one , not even Feige , regret putting the MCU on this one-way path . That 's not to say he never second guess himself , however .
 Two week before `` Infinity War '' came out he had a moment of panic about the snap .
 `` That ending wa one of the reason why we wanted to make the movie . That 's how we sold it to Disney . We were confident in it , '' Feige said . `` But then a week or two week before the film came out , I went , 'Oh no . We 're killing all these people . What if the audience totally reject it ? ' ''
 Speaking just a few week before `` Endgame '' is unleashed on the world , Feige ha found himself in a familiar spot .
 Feige said : `` It 's not until the movie is completely finished , which 'Endgame ' is now completely finished , when you ca n't touch it any more that you go , 'Wait a minute : Should we have touched it more ? ' ''

 Those who targeted the new superhero film were , in part , incited by comment made by it star , Brie Larson , who called it a “ big feminist movie . ”

 “ This is not a revolution , it ’ s a restoration . Girls have always read comic . ”
 — Kelly Sue DeConnick , the comic book writer whose reimagining of Captain Marvel wa the basis of the new film
 Trolls tried to torpedo the new “ Captain Marvel ” movie — but in the end , the shero Carol Danvers ( who ’ s been Captain Marvel in the comic book since 2012 ) prevailed . The film sailed past $ 500 million in ticket sale in it first week .
 ICYMI : Within hour of the movie ’ s release on March 8 ( International Women ’ s Day ) , in what appeared to be a concerted effort , some 58,000 online review of “ Captain Marvel ” had tanked it rating on Rotten Tomatoes — leaving the film with an abysmal score of around 30 percent .
 Rotten Tomatoes fixed the problem by that afternoon , removing about 50,000 of the review , which the site said had been written before the film wa released . Among other measure , the site swiftly eliminated prerelease audience review altogether .
 “ We ’ re doing it to more accurately and authentically represent the voice of fan , ” the site said , “ while protecting our data and public forum from bad actor . ”
 Now , the movie ’ s audience score is around 62 percent , and the “ Tomatometer , ” which analyzes rating from film critic , is at 79 percent , slightly below the average for Marvel movie .

 But “ Captain Marvel ” is not the only recent female-led film in the comic or sci-fi realm to be swarmed by troll . As my colleague Cara Buckley wrote this week : “ The all-female remake of ‘ Ghostbusters , ’ ‘ Black Panther ’ and ‘ Star Wars : The Last Jedi , ’ which had a diverse cast , all found themselves in the cross hair of armchair critic , some aligned with alt-right group . ”
 Last year , a Facebook group called “ Down with Disney ’ s Treatment of Franchises and Its Fanboys ” posted an event called “ Give Black Panther a Rotten Audience Score on Rotten Tomatoes. ” The group had also claimed responsibility for sinking score for “ Star Wars : The Last Jedi . ”
 Those who appeared to have targeted “ Captain Marvel ” were most likely incited by comment made by Brie Larson , the titular star . Last year , Larson vowed to seek out more underrepresented journalist after noticing she wa being interviewed by mostly white men . She had a similar critique about film critic : “ I do not need a 40-year-old white dude to tell me what didn ’ t work for him about ‘ A Wrinkle in Time. ’ It wasn ’ t made for him . ”
 She also told “ Entertainment Tonight ” that the vision for the film wa clear during an early meeting with Marvel : Make “ a big feminist movie . ”
 Even if the troll tried to stop her , make a big feminist movie she did .

 Today , we think of Marvel a the monolithic studio that each year reliably release two or three blockbuster based on it costume-clad comic-book superheroes . It ha built movie like “ Captain Marvel ” and “ Black Panther ” into money-minting franchise , and when it latest offering , “ Avengers : Endgame , ” is released on April 26 , it will conclude a narrative spanning some 22 film that started with “ Iron Man ” in 2008 .
 But Marvel ’ s prosperous future wa hardly a certainty a decade or so ago . In the mid-2000s it wa a smaller , inexperienced company that controlled the film right for only a few of it lesser-known character — other studio had already brought “ X-Men , ” “ Spider-Man ” and “ Fantastic Four ” to theater — at a time when no one in Hollywood wa yet contemplating the idea of an interconnected universe of superhero movie .
 That changed with the help of people like Kevin Feige , who had been an associate producer on “ X-Men ” before Marvel hired him in 2000 ; and Robert Downey Jr. , the veteran actor who wa almost no one ’ s idea of a mass-market magnet when he emerged a a candidate to play Tony Stark , the eccentric billionaire hero of “ Iron Man . ”
 In interview , Feige , now the president of Marvel Studios , and Downey — a star of three “ Iron Man ” s , four “ Avengers ” and a “ Spider-Man ” — spoke about the origin of the Marvel Cinematic Universe , the choice they made , and what it ’ s all meant a “ Endgame ” approach . Here are edited excerpt from those conversation .
 KEVIN FEIGE In 2006 , when we were making our first appearance a our own studio at Comic-Con , the article written around that were basically : “ Marvel ’ s going to try to make movie themselves now . Too bad they ’ ve got to scrape the bottom of the barrel. ” And I remember feeling , wow , I don ’ t think it ’ s the bottom of the barrel .
 Initially , there were 10 character on an official list . And Iron Man wa not one of them . Iron Man became one of them when the right reverted back to Marvel from [ New Line Cinema ] , it instantly went to the top of the list . We were very excited that we could do something different with that film . We had that and “ The Incredible Hulk ” in the same year . And internally , at Marvel corporate , “ Hulk ” — by far , the better-known property — seemed like the slam-dunk and “ Iron Man ” seemed like the risk .
 Marvel started hiring cast and crew for “ Iron Man ” in 2006 — first , the director Jon Favreau and then it star , Robert Downey Jr. , both of whom were coming off recent flop .
 ROBERT DOWNEY JR. Jon and I had this connection . He ’ d had a movie that I very much enjoyed , and I ’ d had one that he very much enjoyed , bomb at the same time . His wa “ Zathura ” and mine wa “ Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. ” And “ Zathura ” put him in a position to be considered viable and capable of doing an effects-driven movie . And “ Kiss Kiss Bang Bang , ” if not the best movie I ’ ve ever done , it ’ s the one I made the fewest mistake in a an actor .
 FEIGE I wa so impressed with “ Elf ” [ directed by Favreau ] , which could simply have been a silly comedy but had so much heart and depth to it . It ha actually great action sequence in it . If you remember , when Santa ’ s sleigh doesn ’ t have enough magic power and the world ha to sing — it ’ s barely lifting out of Central Park and then it rocket over Fifth Avenue , I found myself cheering in a theater at this Will Ferrell comedy .
 I have a distinct memory of being in this bullpen area of our production office , kicking around idea with Jon , and Robert ’ s name came up . We both stopped and looked at each other , like : “ Oh , that would be awesome . But nah , you can ’ t do that . Anyway , who else ? ” And we kept coming back to that .
 DOWNEY I took a meeting at Marvel . And then I wa very pushy , to be honest , which is not really in my nature . But I just had a sneaking suspicion that I had nothing to lose . I decided to take it more seriously than I ’ d ever taken anything . I felt confident , and then I wa told that the meeting went well but I wouldn ’ t put too much on it , it ’ s probably not going to go your way . I refused to let go of it .
 FEIGE I remember saying to a room full of marketing executive : “ If we do our job right , the name Tony Stark will be a famous a the name Iron Man . Because unlike a lot of hero movie , this character is a interesting and a engaging outside of his costume , a he is inside of his costume. ” [ Downey had ] not done something like this before , which meant , I felt , a screen test would help convince anybody that needed to be convinced . He , to his credit , wa absolutely willing to audition for it .
 DOWNEY I ’ m married to a producer , and I think it ’ s odd if somebody think they ’ re above any part of any process that ’ s required for any project . I ’ ve never said , “ I don ’ t do that anymore. ” [ Pause ] Nowadays I might .
 Filming for “ Iron Man ” took place in 2007 , at soundstages on the former site of the Hughes Aircraft Company in Los Angeles .
 DOWNEY We were at an assembly hangar where they made the Spruce Goose . We haven ’ t started shooting yet and we decide to take out a bunch of pellet pistol and put on protective eyewear , and me and Favreau and a couple other folk literally had a psychotic shootout . And I just thought that wa the dumbest , unnecessary , insurance-risk thing I ’ ve ever done — and that ’ s really saying something . It wa our comic-book D-Day . We knew it wa upon u and we were about to start something that could wind up being culturally significant .
 During production of “ Iron Man , ” Feige had a flash of inspiration .
 FEIGE I got a call from Carter Cohn , who represents Sam Jackson , and he go , “ Sam ’ s a big fan — do you guy have anything for him ? ” And in the Ultimate line of Marvel Comics , they had been drawing Nick Fury exactly a Sam Jackson . I went : “ Oh . What if he did a cameo for u a Nick Fury ? ” We put it at the end of the credit so that really only hard-core fan were there . We didn ’ t interrupt the movie , where people go : “ Why is Sam Jackson wearing an eyepatch ? What ’ s going on ? ” And then , a couple month after “ Iron Man , ” “ The Incredible Hulk ” came out and Robert Downey walk into the end of that movie . We could see that , in a best-case scenario , we could start building the universe .
 Moviegoers got one of their first look at “ Iron Man ” in the summer of 2007 , when Favreau , Downey and the cast introduced footage from the film at Comic-Con International in San Diego .
 DOWNEY My missus always say the one thing she ’ ll never forget is watching me watch the footage at Comic-Con . Because she said I wa literally trembling with excitement and satisfaction . And then I went to go shoot “ Tropic Thunder. ” I wa showing Ben Stiller some of the footage from Comic-Con . He just looked at me in the most matter-of-fact way and said : “ That movie ’ s going to be a hit . O.K. , let ’ s get back to set and rehearse this scene. ” I wa like , Oh . He doesn ’ t just say that sort of stuff . So that wa really cool .
 “ Iron Man ” wa released on May 2 , 2008 . In it opening weekend , it grossed more than $ 98 million , and future Marvel movie were no longer a possibility but a certainty .
 DOWNEY We were at Giorgio Baldi , which is a famous Italian joint . We had a little private room there on Friday night a the number came in from Paramount . And I felt like we were at a horse race and we were all betting on ourselves , and we kept betting higher . I wa like , “ We ’ re going to break 85 [ million ] ! ”
 FEIGE That Monday after the opening weekend , we announced date for “ Iron Man 2 , ” “ Thor , ” “ Captain America ” and “ Avengers. ” I remember being very excited that the movie worked well enough that we could do this . We ’ re gon na do the plan ! This is going to be a big deal . And the press did not treat it like a big deal . It wa a footnote to an article about the success of the “ Iron Man ” opening weekend . And I went , Oh , I guess people don ’ t get it yet . [ Laughs ]
 DOWNEY The real daunting thing wa , oh , that ’ s right , we have to go do this again . We get a year break , and I stayed very busy that year , and then we had to do it again . The word “ franchise ” is a verb , if you ask me . You are iterating something that need to be recreated in some way and expanded upon every time .
 FEIGE I started to use phrase like “ Phase 1 of the MCU , ” because I didn ’ t want to merely think of an “ Iron Man ” trilogy or a “ Thor ” trilogy . Which is really the way most people had been conditioned to think about franchise . It all came from the comic — individual character would occasionally come together for a mega-event limited series , in which everything would change , and then they would go back into their own comic , with the new power or the new costume or the psychological change from that big adventure . That ’ s what we could do with one phase , and then an “ Avengers ” movie , a second phase , another “ Avengers ” movie , and then a third one to close it out .
 DOWNEY The first “ Avengers ” tour wa just mind-bogglingly cool and strange , considering that the film wa about to be released but wa already being treated like it wa a phenomenon . The sheer fact that the world wa going , oh , you actually got a lot of actor and actress to get along for long enough .
 As this latest phase of Marvel movie nears it conclusion , Feige and Downey tried to summarize the experience .
 FEIGE This ha been my life for the better part of a decade . I ’ ve gotten married in that decade . I ’ ve had two kid in that decade . And I ’ ve produced 23 movie in that decade . I almost don ’ t want to stop and think about it , for fear of getting blubbery and embarrassing myself .
 DOWNEY If someone had walked into Giorgio Baldi that night and said , hey guy , I ’ m 10 Years From The Future Guy , let me tell what you started here . You would just go , “ No , what if this go wrong ? ” You ’ d be tripping on the what-if ’ s . It ’ s a faith-based activity .

 As the final trailer for “ Avengers : Endgame ” open , S.H.I.E.L.D . agent Nick Fury ( Samuel L. Jackson ) call hero “ an old-fashioned notion. ” But it ’ s one that still sell , a we ’ re reminded in this two-and-a-half-minute clip summarizing the 21 film that have led up to this installment .
 Starting with Robert Downey Jr. ’ s “ Iron Man ” in 2008 , the Marvel Cinematic Universe ha grown to include Captain America ( Chris Evans ) , Thor ( Chris Hemsworth ) , Doctor Strange ( Benedict Cumberbatch ) , Ant-Man ( Paul Rudd ) , Black Panther ( Chadwick Boseman ) , Captain Marvel ( Brie Larson ) , the Guardians of the Galaxy and more .
 The trailer brings back memory , some more vivid than others . Remember when the Incredible Hulk got his own movie ? The footage avoids showing Edward Norton , who originated the role before Mark Ruffalo took it over . Or when Robert Redford played the villain in “ Captain America : The Winter Soldier ” ? That wa weird .
 Breaking chronological order , the spot culminates with “ Avengers : Infinity War ” ( which came out before “ Ant-Man and the Wasp ” and “ Captain Marvel ” ) . In it , Thanos ( Josh Brolin ) wiped out half the world ’ s population and a good chunk of the Avengers . But Captain America promise to do “ whatever it take ” to get payback .
 “ Avengers : Endgame ” will officially hit theater on April 26 .
 An earlier version of this article misstated the timing of “ Black Panther ’ s ” release . It opened before “ Avengers : Infinity War , ” not after .

 In Issue No . 5 of the Unstoppable Wasp , which arrives in comic store on Wednesday , the title hero come to a realization : “ I need help . I think I ’ m bipolar … and I don ’ t think I can handle this alone . ”
 The comic book series , from Marvel Entertainment , star Nadia Van Dyne , who received her scientific curiosity and size-changing ability from her father , Henry Pym , a.k.a . Hank , the former Ant-Man . The issue is written by Jeremy Whitley , drawn by Gurihiru and lettered by Joe Caramagna .
 Last month , the teenage Wasp wa shown intensely trying to solve one problem , which then multiplied into a huge problem . The chalkboard she used for her plan is a cacophony of idea . The situation seems familiar to Nadia ’ s mentor , Janet Van Dyne ( the original Wasp and the ex-wife of Hank Pym ) . “ This look a lot like a manic episode , ” she say , while telling Nadia ’ s friend that Hank had bipolar disorder . “ If it ’ s not treated , a person can have episode — intense change in mood — especially in time of stress , ” she explains .
 Nadia ’ s having bipolar disorder is something Whitley discussed with his editor , Alanna Smith , early on . In doing his research , Whitley said in a telephone interview , he learned that bipolar disorder can be passed along genetically . “ I thought it made sense that she would most likely deal with it at some point , ” he added .
 In the January issue , Nadia wa shown running on fume , refusing to sleep or eat until her work wa done . She also lashed out against her friend .
 The confrontation continues in the new issue a Nadia retreat into her miniature laboratory . In that subatomic environment , where time move more quickly , Nadia go into a depressive phase . One of her friend follows her , and the two have a powerful moment ( better experienced than spoiled here ) .
 Whitley said he heard from family member of people with bipolar disorder who recognized the manic behavior in the previous issue . They “ could see what wa happening before anyone said anything , ” he said .
 His goal , he said , wa to make sure the condition wa treated respectfully , and he consulted with psychologist on the subject . He said he “ also wanted to reflect the reality of the situation : Bipolar disorder is not something you can cure , ” though medicine and therapy can help . He hope that coping with the disorder remains an important part of the Wasp ’ s character , but not her entire being : “ For real people , there ’ s so much more to their life and personality than this one thing . ”
 In Issue No . 5 , the regular Q. and A. feature is with Chris Ceary , who teach psychology at Johns Hopkins University ’ s Peabody Institute . Ceary discus comic , mental health and the presentation of Nadia ’ s bipolar disorder . “ I know so many people will feel seen by this depiction , and that is a gift , ” she say .
 Whitley wa also proud that it is one of Nadia ’ s friend who help her . “ It wa important to me to have this character who is not a superhero , who doe not have any sort of exceptional power , to save the day because she ha the life experience to help Nadia , ” he said . “ There are a lot of story out there of people who have made it through thing because they had the right person at the right time . ”
 An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified the artist of the cover of Issue No . 5 of the Unstoppable Wasp . It is Stacey Lee , not Gurihuru .

 Serial Box , a digital service that delivers book in weekly , chapter length installment , ha just announced a partnership with Marvel to publish new , original story tied to a number of their popular franchise , starting with Thor this summer . The company , which wa founded in 2015 , ha also just received $ 4.5 million in a new round of funding .
 “ Marvel ha grown to become a lifestyle for every kind of fan around the world , but it all started from serialized storytelling , ” said John Nee , the publisher of Marvel Entertainment , in a statement . In addition to Thor , Serial Box will draw from it stable of more than 100 writer to produce story for Black Panther , Black Widow and Jessica Jones .
 Serial Box is the brainchild of Molly Barton , who wa formerly the global digital director for Penguin Random House and her co-founder Julian Yap . The company applies the television model to book : Series are written by “ writer ’ room ” and reader ( or listener — the book are also released in audio form ) can purchase an “ episode ” or an entire “ season. ” Serial Box ha two dozen series available on their platform , ranging from fantasy and sci-fi to mystery or procedurals .
 “ We are really focused on the commute and the idea that people have a short window of time in their day where you can make your content fit that window , ” said Barton in a recent call .
 Having writer work collaboratively allows them to produce content more quickly . “ Every time we bring our writer together for a writer ’ room to create a new series , one of them will say something like , ‘ This process is magical . This would ’ ve taken me three month alone at my desk to solve this problem that we just talked through in 20 minute . ’ ”
 Though yet unannounced , Barton said there are also plan to adapt some of their series to television .

 Even a “ Glass ” is expected to surpass “ Aquaman ” at the top of the box office next week , another superhero-themed movie loom : “ Captain Marvel. ” But the third preview for Marvel ’ s adventure pack a bit le power than it predecessor — or some of this week ’ s other new teaser .
 Marvel billed this 90-second ad , which premiered during the College Football Playoff championship game , a a “ special look , ” but much of the footage ha already been seen in the film ’ s first two trailer . The new scene feature banter about wardrobe between Brie Larson ’ s titular superheroine and “ Avengers ” series staple Nick Fury ( Samuel L. Jackson ) . “ Grunge is a good look for you , ” he tell her — the film is set in 1995 — and she question the wisdom of putting the S.H.I.E.L.D . logo on a hat : “ Does announcing your identity on clothing help with the covert part of your job ? ” It ’ s a good thing nobody go to these movie for the dialogue .
 “ Something truly goddamn strange is going on ! ” art gallery owner Jake Gyllenhaal declares in the mesmerizing trailer for this surreal satire . He ’ s not kidding : A dead artist ’ s work take on supernatural power , devouring their greedy owner . The director Dan Gilroy previously teamed with his real-life wife , Rene Russo , and Gyllenhaal on another dark medium tale , “ Nightcrawler ” ( 2014 ) , and “ Velvet Buzzsaw ” might be even creepier .
 The title could cause confusion with another coming Mads Mikkelsen movie — the outdoor-survival drama “ Arctic ” — but the tone could hardly be more different . In this graphic-novel adaptation , the Danish actor play an aging assassin who ’ s forced out of retirement ( aren ’ t they all ? ) by a squad of younger contract killer hired by his former employer . The stylish visuals and Mikkelsen ’ s eye patch make “ Polar ” look pretty cool .
 Dev Patel is a long way from “ The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel ” in this dramatization of the 2008 terrorist attack on the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Mumbai . The trailer can ’ t seem to decide if it ’ s selling a harrowing docudrama or a “ Die Hard ” -style action thriller , and it ’ s unclear if the film focus on Patel a a hotel employee or Armie Hammer a a guest . In any event , this clip doesn ’ t make “ Hotel Mumbai ” seem worth checking out .
 It ’ s the opposite of “ Big. ” Get it ? Regina Hall ( “ Girls Trip ” ) star a a tech exec who wake up in the body of her gawky 13-year-old self ( played by Marsai Martin of “ black-ish ” ) . The presence of Issa Rae — the creator of HBO ’ s acclaimed “ Insecure ” — heightens expectation , but they ’ re cut down by the trailer ’ s painfully strained gag .

 One audience reviewer deemed the movie “ a complete disaster. ” Another wa “ tired of all this SJW nonsense , ” using the abbreviation for “ social justice warrior , ” a pejorative term for progressive . Yet another groused that Brie Larson , the movie ’ s star , “ say I shouldn ’ t see the movie anyway . ”
 “ Captain Marvel ” had not even been released yet — it opening day wa a month away — but that did not stop negative remark from piling up against the film and Ms. Larson .
 Much a Facebook and Twitter have had to grapple with false story aimed at inciting violence or disrupting election , movie review aggregator like Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb are often besieged by user trying to manipulate a film ’ s box office success .
 Despite the troll ’ concerted effort , “ Captain Marvel ” slayed during it opening weekend , but not before Rotten Tomatoes , an influential site where a bad audience score can damage a film ’ s prospect , made major change to it rule . Most critically , it eliminated prerelease audience review . It also stopped displaying the percentage of moviegoer who say they “ want to see ” a film in favor of using the raw number of people . And it removed the “ not interested ” button .
 “ We ’ re doing it to more accurately and authentically represent the voice of fan , ” the site said , “ while protecting our data and public forum from bad actor . ”
 The backlash against “ Captain Marvel ” resulted from a collision of two major force . One wa the popularity of website that at their best democratize the reviewing of movie , restaurant and business and at their worst can be weaponized for score-settling or political grudge .
 The other wa the growing movement in Hollywood toward broader gender and racial representation in film role , production job and the industry in general .
 “ Captain Marvel ” is among the few superhero film to star a woman , but a bigger trigger factor for the film ’ s hater appeared to be Ms. Larson ’ s outspokenness about the lack of diversity in movie and news medium coverage of film .
 Before the film ’ s release , Ms. Larson told “ Entertainment Tonight ” that she had spoken with Marvel about making the film “ a big feminist movie. ” In another interview , she said that after noticing that most of her interviewer in the past had been white and male , she vowed to seek out more underrepresented journalist , including Keah Brown , who is black and disabled , and who profiled her for Marie Claire .
 Ms. Larson , who won the best-actress Oscar in 2016 for her performance in “ Room , ” had previously lashed out against the homogeneity of professional film critic . “ I do not need a 40-year-old white dude to tell me what didn ’ t work for him about ‘ A Wrinkle in Time , ’ ” she said during a speech last summer . “ It wasn ’ t made for him . ”
 This all provided fodder to troll , and week ahead of “ Captain Marvel ’ s ” release , the percentage of Rotten Tomatoes user who registered that they wanted to see it plummeted to 27 percent . On Feb. 25 , Rotten Tomatoes implemented the change , and the “ want to see ” score disappeared . Since the film ’ s nationwide release on Friday , the audience score ha rebounded to a better-but-still-not-great 63 percent , the lowest for any movie in the Marvel franchise . For a while , the score had been below 60 percent , signified by a tipped-over bucket of popcorn , the symbol for a film that might be one to skip .
 The “ Tomatometer , ” which analyzes the rating from film critic , is at a “ certified fresh ” 79 percent , slightly below the average for Marvel movie . It is impossible to say whether the website ’ s change helped the film , but it made $ 456 million during it opening weekend , trouncing projection .
 A representative for Ms. Larson declined to comment , and publicist at Disney , which owns Marvel Studios , did not reply to email Tuesday .
 The film ’ s opponent also swarmed YouTube ; video rant with title like “ Brie Larson is Ruining Marvel ” often appeared at the top of search for her name . But a day before the film ’ s release , a change in the search result pushed those video beneath others from established source like Jimmy Kimmel , “ Today ” and Wired .
 A YouTube representative said the reason wa an algorithm change made last summer that reclassifies trending search topic a news . The site , which is owned by Google , took the action a part of it effort to combat fictitious content and ensure that reliable information wa highlighted .
 “ Captain Marvel ” detractor also flocked to IMDb , though a representative from that site said no one wa available to comment , and would only provide a link to the site ’ s rating and comment policy , which state that user are not allowed to rate a film before it release .
 The new Marvel movie is not the first film to come under attack for a perceived feminist or politically correct underpinning . The all-female remake of “ Ghostbusters , ” “ Black Panther ” and “ Star Wars : The Last Jedi , ” which had a diverse cast , all found themselves in the cross hair of armchair critic , some aligned with alt-right group .
 Some site pushed back . Last year , Rotten Tomatoes said it would delete comment posted from member of the Facebook group “ Down with Disney ’ s Treatment of Franchises and Its Fanboys ” if they contained hate speech . The group had posted an event called “ Give Black Panther a Rotten Audience Score on Rotten Tomatoes. ” Facebook then deactivated the group ( it ha since been revived by someone claiming to be anti-troll ) , which had also claimed responsibility for torpedoing audience score for “ Star Wars : The Last Jedi . ”
 That a movie starring Ms. Larson spurred Rotten Tomatoes into taking a bolder step wa no coincidence .
 When Ms. Larson spoke out last summer against the dominance of white male critic , she cited finding by the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative , which is run out of the University of Southern California and had singled out Rotten Tomatoes for having 3.5 men to every female critic reviewing the top film of 2017 .
 In her speech , Ms. Larson also revealed that the Sundance and Toronto film festival had each pledged to set aside one-fifth of their press pass for use by diverse journalist , including woman and people of color .
 Two and a half month later , Rotten Tomatoes threw in with Ms. Larson ’ s cause , and revamped it criterion for critic , focusing more on individual qualification than the brand and reach of a publication , to include hundred of reviewer from underrepresented group in it Tomatometer score ( a representative said the change had been in development for over a year ) . It also pledged $ 100,000 to various film festival working to diversify their press corp , in part by helping cover freelancer ’ travel and lodging cost .
 A representative for Rotten Tomatoes , Dana Benson , said the change to it audience score had been in the work for a while , but that the attack on “ Captain Marvel ” prompted them to roll it out earlier than planned .
 “ We ’ re very dedicated to making criticism more inclusive , ” Ms. Benson said . “ All the thought and care that went into the Tomatometer , we are expanding that to the audience score . ”
 Rotten Tomatoes said future change could include having “ verified ” reviewer , like the one who post on Amazon after purchasing a product . Those could come from people who bought ticket through Fandango , the movie ticket website , which owns Rotten Tomatoes .
 There wa , not unexpectedly , a flip side to the attack on “ Captain Marvel ” — people rushing to it defense , whether they had seen the movie or not .
 “ There are a large group of people that are only down-voting this movie because they somehow feel threatened by it , ” wrote one fan on Rotten Tomatoes .
 “ Imagine being so insecure , you cry about a movie with a girl a the hero , ” wrote another .
 And over on IMDb , one wrote : “ I do agree that this isn ’ t marvel ’ s best movie , but it wa a fun and enjoyable ride . I ’ m sure director and co. were hyper aware of the backlash they were facing and some of the moment seemed like tongue-in-cheek middle finger to all the hate . ”

 The Carpetbagger
 By Kyle Buchanan
 The Oscar nomination are read in Los Angeles at just after 5 in the morning , a time when most late-to-wake Hollywood type would rather be slumbering underneath high-thread-count sheet . Still , the Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige wasn ’ t about to miss the televised announcement .
 “ I watched them this morning for the first time in many year , ” Feige told your Carpetbagger today by phone . “ I set my alarm , and I haven ’ t done that since I wa a film nerd in college . ”
 His interest wa well-rewarded : “ Black Panther ” became the first Marvel film to score a nomination for best picture , and the phenomenally successful superhero film picked up six more nomination to boot . “ I ’ m feeing a sense of pride and humility and immense gratitude , ” Feige said .
 [ Read more about the nomination | Check out the full list of nominee | See the snub and surprise . ]
 And though the academy failed to nominate Ryan Coogler for directing and co-writing the film , “ you ’ re going to hear me say the name ‘ Ryan Coogler ’ constantly on this phone call , ” Feige said , emphasizing the importance of inclusive and diverse filmmaking . “ To me , the best thing a producer can do is find a person with something to say , who ha a story to tell and can tell it in a way that the world responds to . That ’ s what Mr. Coogler ha done for u . ”
 Feige is known for being one of Hollywood ’ s most even-keeled executive , so I asked if he found himself exclaiming aloud a any of the nomination were read . “ It mainly manifested itself in numerous emojis , ” Feige said . On a group chat that included Coogler , the executive producer Nate Moore and Disney chief executive Bob Iger , there were “ a lot of firework- and confetti-laden text message flying fast and furious . ”
 To composer Ludwig Goransson , whose “ Black Panther ” score wa nominated , Feige texted a video Coogler had taped two year ago when the two men decided on the theme music , “ where Ryan recorded himself dancing around with this unbelievable joy. ” Feige wa just a eager to text the production designer Hannah Beachler , who became the first African-American to be nominated in her category .
 “ She wa hired in the room , ” Feige said . “ I knew she ’ d never worked on a film this large before and had concern about that , but we wanted to give her a chance to come in and pitch her vision for the movie . She came in and blew u away instantly . Journeys don ’ t get better than that . ”
 But even with all the congratulation — and an additional visual-effects nomination for the studio ’ s “ Avengers : Infinity War ” — Feige had to get back to work . Marvel ha plenty on it plate this spring , including the release of “ Captain Marvel ” and “ Avengers : Endgame , ” and a day off to celebrate just wouldn ’ t do .
 Still , he said , “ there ’ s enthusiasm in the hallway , that ’ s for sure . ”

 At the “ Captain Marvel ” premiere in Los Angeles last month , Brie Larson roamed the red carpet in a sequined Rodarte slip dress , a galaxy of diamond cradling her ear . A squadron of F-16 fighter jet flew overhead a fan cheered the movie ’ s star a she climbed step to a stage where she wa interviewed by Lorraine Cink .
 Ms. Cink , a self-described comic book geek and red carpet host , did not ask Ms. Larson about her gown a others did that day . Nor did she discus the movie ’ s internet troll or Ms. Larson ’ s call for more diversity in Hollywood . Instead she focused solely on Captain Marvel and her alter ego Carol Danvers , a United States Air Force pilot , played by Ms. Larson .
 “ Carol changed my life and this movie hasn ’ t even come out yet , ” Ms. Larson said , a she held back tear .
 Red carpet interview from the premiere were streamed live for fan who could not attend . And the show wa a slickly produced a any pre-awards festivity , albeit one that edged toward camp at time . ( For starter , Ms. Cink ’ s co-host interviewed a cat , one of several that played Goose in the movie . )
 Ms. Cink is an employee of Marvel Studios , which produced Captain Marvel . And if there is any question why the studio would air the red carpet live , consider this : The live stream ha been watched more than 485,000 time on YouTube alone .
 Fans today clamor for anything related to their favorite movie and television franchise . As a result , live-streaming from the red carpet is not just for the Oscars anymore . More studio are producing their own red carpet extravaganza , hiring battalion of brand-friendly host to market the studio ’ s offering and control social medium messaging . And with technology that make live-steaming easy , new player have joined the fray to take advantage of the summer blockbuster season and it worldwide audience .
 “ Movie premiere have become global moment , ” said Doug Neil , Universal Pictures executive vice president for digital marketing . “ Fans like to feel like they are part of the experience . ”
 Mr. Neil would know . Last year the studio held only one premiere in London for “ Mamma Mia ! Here We Go Again. ” With an army of Academy Award winner on the red carpet — including Meryl Streep , Colin Firth , Tom Hanks and Cher — the event would be difficult for Universal to reproduce elsewhere , he said . Premieres are expensive , too , sometimes costing $ 100,000 or more . So the festivity in London were live-streamed on Facebook , where they were viewed more than 451,000 time around the world .
 “ The talent bench wa so deep , ” Mr. Neil said of the celebrity who attended . “ And Facebook ha our largest community of fans. ” With streaming technology , he added , “ It ’ s very easy to flip a switch . ”
 The quality , though , can depend on whose hand is on the switch . “ When we started doing this , it wa iPhones on tripod , ” said Alison Hoffman , chief marketing officer for the cable channel Starz . Now , she said , the company team up with medium outlet , like Entertainment Weekly , People and Entertainment Tonight , to host live stream red carpet event . That wa the case last June at the premiere of “ Power ” at Radio City Music Hall in Manhattan . The channel broadcast a live stream with three video camera .
 “ For the right show , it ’ s a critical part of the mix , ” Ms. Hoffman said .
 That is not always the case , though . Last week , the cast of “ Game of Thrones ” gathered at Radio City Music Hall for the final red carpet premiere for the beloved HBO show . The spectacle wa broadcast live by NowThis , a social medium content company , which streamed unscripted , raw footage from the “ Game of Thrones ” press line . An HBO executive said the company wa neither involved in nor aware of the live stream , which explains why it had none of the polish of a typical HBO affair .
 Photographers could be heard booing when Sophie Turner , who play Sansa Stark , invited Joe Jonas , her pop star fiancé , to join her on the red carpet . “ How about a kiss ? ” a man shouted at Lisa Bonet , the wife of Jason Momoa , who delighted a the he-man Khal Drogo in Season 1 . Ms. Bonet shook her head no ; her husband wa visibly annoyed .
 The video itself wa sketchy , too . The camera shook and the Wi-Fi wa unreliable . Gwendoline Christie looked fetching in a flowing yellow gown until she waved her silken sleeve and the screen disappeared into a haze of pixelated square . Still , the live stream ha been watched more than 188,000 time on YouTube .
 “ It ’ s not always the best quality that get the most eyeball , ” said Tina Exarhos , the chief content officer of NowThis . “ When you are on a red carpet , these are the moment you look for . ”
 Despite the video ’ s raw quality , she added , “ We are looking to do more and more of these with studio . ”
 The Walt Disney Studios , which oversees Lucasfilm , Marvel Studios , Pixar and it own slate of movie , ha the most sophisticated live-streaming operation in Hollywood . Lylle Breier , who oversees premiere and special event for the studio , said there were often multiple host — some on stage , others on the red carpet — and several camera used for interview .
 The movie that attract the most attention are the “ Star Wars ” and Marvel franchise . Last April ’ s red carpet premiere for “ Avengers : Infinity War , ” for example , ha been watched 7.28 million time . There , Gwyneth Paltrow plugged her company , Goop . ( “ She did a Goop detox and she ’ s fine , ” she said of her stressed-out character , Pepper Potts . ) Ms. Paltrow also admitted to never having watched an “ Avengers ” movie .
 As many a 30 people are hired to produce a live-streamed red carpet show for a Disney company premiere . And host , like Ms. Cink , have job mostly because they are fan . “ They do not ask reporter-type question , ” Ms. Breier said .
 Ms. Cink ha hosted at least six streaming red carpet premiere and writes all her own question . She copped to being flustered by only one celebrity : Stan Lee , the force behind Marvel Comics . ( Mr. Lee died in November , and “ Captain Marvel ” carry a dedication to him , a well a a montage of his movie cameo in the Marvel logo . )
 Her background in improvisational theater is helpful , she said . Once her earpiece quit working during a live shot , which made it impossible to hear .
 “ I looked like a deer in the headlight , ” she said . “ I screamed my intro . I know I looked , like , cuckoo banana . And it wa completely live . I wa kicking off the whole show . ”

 Warning : This article contains some spoiler about “ Captain Marvel , ” but no cat pun .

 For a breakout star , it wa a fairly mundane audition . To cast the part of Goose , an orange tabby who play a critical role , the maker of “ Captain Marvel ” were meeting different cat , including Ursula Brauner ’ s Reggie . “ We walked into a roomful of people , and I brought a big plush bed and set it on the table , ” Brauner recalled . “ Reggie hung out on the bed and wa a chill a any cat could be , and the filmmaker saw him embody the character then and there . That ’ s how he got the job . ”
 “ Captain Marvel ” earned more than $ 500 million worldwide in it first week of release , in no small part thanks to Reggie and three fellow feline who steal scene a the stray who is revealed to be a ferocious alien known a a Flerken . ( In the original Marvel comic book , the cat ha the “ Star Wars ” -esque name of Chewie , but the screenwriter changed it to Goose to go along with the movie ’ s “ Top Gun ” motif . )
 Goose , who got his own character poster even before the movie wa released , ha been singled out by reviewer ( “ Best of all there is an orange cat , ” A.O . Scott wrote in The Times ” ) , inspired meme and been the subject of an ode . Kevin Feige , the president of Marvel Studios , even speculated that Goose could star in short on the streaming service being started by Marvel ’ s owner , Disney .
 [ How this movie could solve Marvel Studios ’ woman problem . | Mar-Vell explained . ]
 Although special effect were involved , the actual animal are onscreen a fair amount , but at first it wa going to be just Reggie . “ After looking at the script and seeing the work required , we all decided it would be good to add a couple more cat to the team , ” said Brauner , whose company , Animals for Hollywood , provides and train nonhuman actor for film . In addition to Reggie and another experienced animal actor , Archie ( yes , they ’ re named after Archie Comics character ) , Brauner found two more orange tabby , named Gonzo and Rizzo in a nod to the Muppets , at a shelter .
 Each one had a specialty . “ Reggie wa our all-around go-to cat — he ’ s seen in most of the film , ” Brauner said . “ Archie is really rambunctious and love to play , so we used him for the scratching scene. ” The movie , set in 1995 , depicts the S.H.I.E.L.D . agent Nick Fury ( Samuel L. Jackson ) suffering a cat-related injury , necessitating his signature eye-patch . ( The comic ’ explanation that he lost an eye in World War II didn ’ t jibe with the movie ’ s timeline . )
 “ Gonzo wa mostly for holding in the scene when Goose is carried , ” Brauner continued . “ And Rizzo wa the master of all trade — we trained him in a little bit of everything , so he could step in if we needed backup . ”
 How do you train notoriously finicky cat ? Brauner said the process wa not a tough a you might think . “ Cats can be just a smart , lovable and easy to train a any dog , ” she said . “ It ’ s all positive reinforcement . We use food and treat , and there are different level . We save the real good , hot stuff for when something ’ s a little harder or we ’ re further away from the cat on the set , just to make it worth their while . ”
 Verbal command and clickers were also used . “ When they ’ ve done something right , the sound of the clicker is like an instant ‘ Yes ! ’ ” Brauner explained . “ They look forward to that , because they know a pet or a little piece of chicken or liver is coming . ”
 The cat also eagerly anticipated interacting with their two-legged co-star . “ Sam always gave them treat , ” Brauner said . “ Every time they saw Sam , it wa like , ‘ Oh , I remember you ! ’ ”
 And even though Ben Mendelsohn play an alien who fear Flerkens , he couldn ’ t resist cozying up to the cat either . “ His costume wa a challenge , because he looked so different from a normal person , ” said Brauner , who wa given one of the character ’ s prosthetics-heavy suit to use in training . Once shooting began , “ Ben would always take the opportunity to hang out with the cat and make them feel comfortable , and they really needed that . ”
 What about Brie Larson , who star a the titular superheroine ? “ She ha an allergy , but it never affected u or the cat , ” Brauner said . “ She wa wonderful and always open to helping u , and I really respected her for that . ”
 Even after four month of pre-production training , the cat couldn ’ t perform some action that Flerkens can , like shooting tentacle from their mouth . “ That ’ s when special effect came in , ” Brauner said . “ Sometimes , like in the jet when the G-force is pushing Goose back , that wa computer-generated , but a lot of it wa Reggie , no C.G . needed . The filmmaker did a much a they could just with him . ”
 Brauner said the most difficult part of her job wa “ getting the cat used to working on a chaotic movie set. ” That ’ s also why Reggie didn ’ t actually attend the film ’ s premiere , although separate shot were taken of him wearing a tiny tie on the red carpet : “ We try to make sure we don ’ t bring him out in public where something could go wrong , like a loud noise . ”
 Still , should they be asked to return in any future Marvel movie — or short for a streaming service — Brauner said Reggie and the gang are ready for action . “ I truly don ’ t know if that will happen , ” she said . “ We ’ re always up for that kind of challenge . ”
 Goose ’ s popularity “ surprised u a much a anybody , ” Brauner said . “ But a lot of it is Reggie — his charisma absolutely shine through . ”
 Brauner said fame hadn ’ t changed the cat . “ We try to keep them grounded , ” she joked . “ We ’ re good parent and make sure it doesn ’ t go to their head . ”

 The story kernel at the center of “ Black Leopard , Red Wolf , ” Marlon James ’ s surreal new fantasy epic , concern the search for a missing boy . A hunter named Tracker , who is famous for his nose — “ for finding what would rather stay lost ” — is hired to find the lost child , who may or may not be the rightful heir to the throne of an ancient African empire . Tracker soon realizes that he is only one of many hired to find the boy — or proof of his death .
 The search for the boy , it turn out , is a giant MacGuffin : The very first sentence of the novel informs u that the child is dead , and James us the search a an armature on which to hang dozen of other tale , much the way he used the story of an assassination attempt on Bob Marley in his award-winning 2014 novel “ A Brief History of Seven Killings ” a scaffolding to create a tangled , choral portrait of Jamaica and it relationship with the United States .
 In these page , James conjures the literary equivalent of a Marvel Comics universe — filled with dizzying , magpie reference to old movie and recent TV , ancient myth and classic comic book , and fused into something new and startling by his gift for language and sheer inventiveness .
 The fictional Africa in “ Black Leopard , Red Wolf ” feel like a place mapped by Gabriel García Márquez and Hieronymus Bosch with an assist from Salvador Dalí . It ’ s a magical , sometimes beautiful place , but also a place filled with malicious vampire , demon , witch and necromancer , given to murder , cannibalism and the hurling of evil spell . The action is often gut-wrenchingly violent — part “ Blood Meridian , ” part “ Deadpool , ” part “ Game of Thrones. ” Innocents are slaughtered in showdown between rival group . Curses and dark prophecy multiply . Hearts and eyeball are bloodily plucked out .
 Metamorphosis — of the sort made famous by both Ovid and Stan Lee — is one of the novel ’ s central theme . There ’ s Tracker ’ s passage into manhood through a series of harrowing adventure ; and his love-hate relationship with the Leopard , a charismatic being who can incarnate himself a both an animal and a man . Tracker also ha a series of alarming encounter with shape-shifting creature who may be adversary or ally or both — including Sasabonsam , a menacing batlike creature who may have kidnapped the missing boy ; and Nyka , a mercenary and former friend who once committed a terrible act of betrayal .
 [ Marlon James list his 10 desert-island book . ]
 How did these character reach these particular crossroad ? Whom can Tracker trust , and can the reader trust Tracker — or is he a unreliable a narrator a the rival and relative who offer conflicting story line , suggesting that truth is “ a shifting , slithering thing ” ? Is his father really his grandfather , a his uncle asserts ? Will he avenge himself on the men who killed his brother and father ? Will his love for a group of orphaned , misfit child replace the anger in his heart and give him a sense of purpose ? Why doe Tracker hide his real feeling about the Leopard ? And why doe the Leopard tell him to “ learn not to need people ” ? Such question are not entirely answered in this volume — which is only the first installment of what James is calling his “ Dark Star ” trilogy .
 In keeping with familiar fantasy and sci-fi template ( from Harry Potter to “ The Matrix ” to “ The Lion King ” ) , the plot of “ Black Leopard , Red Wolf ” retraces many of the step that the scholar Joseph Campbell described a stage in the archetypal hero ’ s journey . Like Luke Skywalker in “ Star Wars ” and Frodo in “ The Lord of the Rings , ” Tracker set off on a journey that will take him away from home — to distant land and kingdom , where he face a series of dangerous test . And like many a comic-book superhero and antihero before him , Tracker grapple painfully with his own identity , even a he fight off a succession of opponent who threaten to thwart his mission . Along the way , a his path converges with that of others looking for the missing boy , Tracker becomes part of a motley group of mercenary and misfit who squabble noisily and violently among themselves — and who bear more than a passing resemblance to the sort of ragtag team of rival assembled in movie like “ The Dirty Dozen , ” “ The Avengers ” and “ Guardians of the Galaxy . ”
 There are allusion in “ Black Leopard , Red Wolf ” not just to countless Marvel series and character ( like the Black Panther , Deadpool and Wolverine ) , but also to myriad literary work including Octavia E. Butler ’ s sci-fi classic “ Wild Seed , ” Angela Carter ’ s “ The Bloody Chamber , ” Salman Rushdie ’ s “ The Satanic Verses , ” Tolkien ’ s Middle-earth novel , Ursula K. Le Guin ’ s Earthsea book , Jung ’ s writing on archetype and the collective unconscious and African epic about trickster and shape-shifting character who symbolize chaos and change .
 James is such a nimble and fluent writer that such reference never threaten to devolve into pretentious postmodern exercise . Even when he is nestling one tale within another like Russian doll that underscore the provisional nature of storytelling ( and the Rashomon-like way in which we remember ) , he is giving u a gripping , action-packed narrative . What the novel could have used is a little judicious pruning : As in superhero movie , the action sometimes assumes a predictable , episodic rhythm — one violent , bravura showdown after another , strung together by interlude of travel and effort to regroup and connect the dot .
 What propels the novel forward is the same thing that fuel the best superhero movie and comic book : the origin story of it central character . We read to find out how Tracker became the Red Wolf and how the Leopard became the Leopard . In their beginning are their end : the key to their strength and vulnerability , the source of their drive and ambition and fear , and clue to the larger goal that endow their quest for self-knowledge with some larger sense of mission .
 With Tracker and the Leopard , James ha created two compelling and iconic character — character who will take their place in the pantheon of memorable and fantastical superheroes .

 DC Comics ’ s latest superhero spectacle , “ Shazam ! , ” which open this weekend , follows the comedic adventure of Billy Batson ( Asher Angel ) , a teenage boy who transforms into an adult superhero called Shazam ( Zachary Levi ) . A buff , lightning-bolt-emblazoned man-boy , Shazam isn ’ t a well-known now a he used to be . But he is one of the most important hero in comic history .
 Shazam first appeared in Whiz Comics No . 2 in 1939 , quickly becoming one of the most popular comic book character of the 1940s . In his prime , he regularly outsold Superman and Batman . And he wa the first comic book superhero to appear on film .
 Back then , however , he went by the name Captain Marvel , which is a bit confusing , particularly given the debut of Marvel ’ s “ Captain Marvel ” last month . That may also help explain why Shazam feel a bit unfamiliar today .
 [ Our critic called “ Shazam ! ” a “ nice change of pace for a big-screen mega-comic , if not a revolutionary shift ” ]
 Early box office prediction indicate that may be changing . Still , who is this guy ? And what ’ s with the Captain Marvel thing ? Here ’ s a primer on Shazam ’ s history .
 In 1939 , Fawcett Comics wa looking to capitalize on the superhero boom created by character like Superman . The writer Bill Parker came up with the idea of a team of superheroes , each of whom possessed the power of a different mythological figure . The idea wa ultimately revised to just one character with all of those power , and thus wa born Shazam .
 Parker originally called him Captain Thunder , but that name wa already trademarked , so he switched to Captain Marvel . ( A competitor , Timely Comics , did not rebrand a Marvel Comics until 1961 . ) The artist C.C . Beck wa the illustrator , and he continued to draw Captain Marvel throughout the 1940s .
 [ Read the history of Marvel ’ s Captain Marvel here ]
 In his first appearance , Billy is an orphaned paperboy who meet a wizard in a mysterious subway station . After learning about Billy ’ s sad life , the wizard declares that he is too old to keep fighting crime and asks Billy to take his place . He endows Billy with the power to turn into Captain Marvel any time he say the word “ Shazam , ” which is an acronym for the “ immortal elder ” who give him his power : Solomon , Hercules , Atlas , Zeus , Achilles and Mercury .
 The fact that Captain Marvel wa secretly a kid made him a favorite among young reader . “ Whiz Comics ” No . 2 sold 500,000 copy , and the character ’ s own series , “ Captain Marvel Adventures , ” first came out in 1941 , the same year he made his big screen debut .
 That film debut , in March 1941 , wa the 12-part live-action Republic Pictures serial “ Adventures of Captain Marvel. ” It is considered the first comic book superhero film , and it beat the first animated Superman cartoon to the big screen by six month .
 In that version , Billy is a young explorer on an expedition to Siam , where he encounter the wizard . As Captain Marvel , he is tasked with protecting the world from the Golden Scorpion , an ancient and dangerous device sought by scientist and criminal . “ Adventures of Captain Marvel ” feel somewhat primitive and surprisingly violent by today ’ s superhero standard ( Captain Marvel kill a lot of people ) , but it ’ s worth viewing to see how far the genre ha come .
 In 1951 , National Comics Publications successfully argued that Captain Marvel wa a copyright infringement on Superman because of their similar power , costume and artwork , signaling an end to a legal battle that began a decade earlier . ( National had even tried to block the release of “ Adventures of Captain Marvel. ” ) Fawcett paid National $ 400,000 in damage and wa forced to cancel all of it superhero publication . No new Captain Marvel comic were produced for the next 22 year .
 In 1972 , DC Comics acquired the right to Fawcett ’ s character and began producing new Captain Marvel story the next year . Marvel Comics , however , had meanwhile trademarked the name , creating it own Captain Marvel in 1967 . DC wa permitted to call it superhero Captain Marvel , but it wa not allowed to use the name on any marketing or title featuring the character . DC decided to sell it Captain Marvel book under the title “ Shazam ! ”
 A child ’ s television series based on DC ’ s Captain Marvel , titled “ Shazam ! , ” debuted on CBS in 1974 . In the series , Billy ( Michael Gray ) travel around the country in a motor home with an adult companion ( Les Tremayne ) solving problem each week by turning into Captain Marvel ( played by Jackson Bostwick and later John Davey ) . The show had a very low budget , so Captain Marvel appeared only very briefly in each episode .
 The show lasted three season . A short-lived animated series featuring Captain Marvel , called “ The Kid Super Power Hour With Shazam ! ” followed in 1981 , and lasted 12 episode , but that wa his last starring role for a while .
 Through the 1980s and ’ 90 , DC further integrated Captain Marvel into it comic universe , giving the character appearance in “ Justice League , ” “ Kingdom Come ” and his own continuing series , “ The Power of Shazam ! , ” which lasted from 1995 to 1999 . He returned to television in a 2005 episode of “ Justice League Unlimited. ” Playing on the fraught history between Captain Marvel and Superman , the character is introduced a a big fan of Superman , but the two hero eventually come to blow .
 The episode includes a fun Easter egg for comic book fan , a Captain Marvel ’ s hometown is named Fawcett City after his original publisher . Captain Marvel also make several appearance in the Cartoon Network series “ Batman : The Brave and the Bold ” and in several of DC ’ s direct-to-video animated film .
 In 2011 , DC Comics relaunched all it comic with the New 52 initiative . New 52 wa an attempt to simplify decade of complicated comic book history , and Captain Marvel received an updated origin story by the writer Geoff Johns , along with an official name change to Shazam .
 The new “ Shazam ! ” film incorporates multiple element of the back story introduced by Johns . In 2018 , DC debuted a new “ Shazam ! ” comic book , the character ’ s first continuing series in nearly 20 year . Shazam may never again overtake Superman in popularity , but the box office and critical success of the new film should ensure that a whole new generation will know his name .

 Who are your favorite superheroes ? Are any of them female ?
 Does the gender of a comic character matter ? Why or why not ?
 In “ Can ‘ Captain Marvel ’ Fix Marvel ’ s Woman Problem ? , ” Dave Itzkoff writes :
 When “ Captain Marvel ” open next Friday , it will be a moment of great satisfaction mixed with lingering frustration .
 The film , which star Brie Larson a that spacefaring comic-book superhero , is the 21st entry in the interconnected Marvel movie franchise since it began in 2008 but only the first to focus principally on a woman .
 By now , audience have grown accustomed to superhero movie that put woman in the spotlight . In 2017 , “ Wonder Woman , ” based on DC Comics ’ Amazonian warrior , wa a worldwide hit for Warner Bros .
 Marvel ha built it own fortune on a decades-old supply of costumed adventurer that doesn ’ t lack for woman . And the studio ha been criticized for it slowness to create movie emphasizing it female character .
 So what took Marvel a long a it did to reach this point ? And will “ Captain Marvel ” be the movie that make good on this long unfulfilled potential ?
 The article concludes :
 It ’ s unclear whether “ Captain Marvel ” will be the start of a trend or an outlier for Marvel . Hollywood trade publication have reported that the studio is preparing other female-led project , including a Black Widow movie , starring Johansson and directed by Cate Shortland ( “ Lore ” ) , and a film adaptation of the Eternals , directed by Chloé Zhao ( “ The Rider ” ) . But Disney said it could not confirm Marvel ’ s development slate .
 Whether “ Captain Marvel ” can be a harbinger for other movie like it , Larson said , “ is a larger question , a systemic thing . ”
 “ That change is scary , ” she said , “ and it take time for it to come . It ’ s slow but it ’ s happening . ”
 The only way such progress can happen , Larson said , is if she and her peer use the influence afforded by movie like “ Captain Marvel ” to strive for further change and to make them permanent .
 “ Part of why I ’ m pushing really hard now is because I do have a little bit of power , and I ’ m going to use it , ” she said . “ You don ’ t know when it ’ s going to shift again or who ’ s going to have the power next . But I ’ ll push it a far a I can . Because it ’ s the right thing to do . ”
 Students , read the entire article , then tell u :
 — Do we need more female superheroes ? Does the gender of a superhero matter ?
 — Heidi MacDonald , editor of The Beat , a comic culture website , said of Stan Lee , the longtime editor of Marvel Comics :
 “ You can ’ t help but think that if Stan Lee wasn ’ t a conscious sexist , he certainly wa so traditional . He gave his female character the weakest power — ‘ Oh , I can get very small. ’ ‘ I can turn invisible. ’ ‘ I can move a teacup with my mind . ’ ”
 Does Marvel Comics have a “ woman problem ? ” How well do you think woman and female superheroes have been depicted in Marvel film ? Do you think the success of Captain Marvel might lead to a trend of female superheroes in featured role ?
 — Who is your favorite among female superheroes ? What characteristic make them most compelling to you ? Tell u why .
 — Which female superhero would you like to see featured in a movie ? Write the opening to a pitch to Hollywood executive to greenlight this film .
 — Will you see Captain Marvel when it open on Friday ?

 IRON MAN ( 2008 ) Rent on Google Play , iTunes , Vudu and YouTube .

In her review for The Times , Manohla Dargis called the movie “ queasily enjoyable . ”

 American Ronin , about highly trained corporate operative ; Fight Girls , about warrior vying to be queen of the galaxy ; and Bad Mother , about a parent searching for her missing daughter : These are some of the story that are coming from a new comic publisher , Artists , Writers & Artisans , one that is posing the question , what story could we develop if we begin with a blank slate ?
 In comic book , there are two main publishing model . One emphasizes flagship character — like Batman and Spider-Man — whose success largely benefit their company , DC and Marvel Comics . The other is creator-focused , where hit like The Walking Dead , by Robert Kirkman and published by Image Comics , can mean a financial windfall for it creator . AWA is aiming for something between the two : It will have interconnected superhero comic like DC and Marvel a well a stand-alone series like Image . And all of it creator will have a financial stake .
 It ’ s an approach reminiscent of old Hollywood . “ The model here really is the old United Artists model , where people who are actually doing the creative have ownership , control and decision-making power over the work that they ’ re doing , ” said Bill Jemas , a former chief operating officer and publisher at Marvel who is the chief executive and publisher of AWA . Joining him at the helm are Axel Alonso , a former editor in chief at Marvel , a chief creative officer and Jonathan F. Miller a chairman . Miller helped broker a deal in 2017 between the comic book writer Mark Millar and Netflix , which bought his library of character for development on the streaming service . Jemas and Alonso say the first of AWA ’ s title will arrive some time this fall .
 [ Read about TKO , another new comic publisher aiming to shake thing up . ]
 “ What we ’ re offering creator is an opportunity to bet on themselves without putting it all on the line , ” Alonso said , during a recent conference-call interview with Jemas . Their stable of writer and artist includes both veteran and newcomer , Alonso said . They would be paid to produce the work a well a own their story and character , a percentage of the company or both .
 Besides AWA — whose team also includes Frank Cho , the writer Peter Milligan and Christa Faust and the artist known a ACO — there are other newcomer to the field trying to rupture the mold of comic book publishing . TKO Studios , which announced itself in December , plan to binge-release it mini-series , simultaneously selling collected edition of those story and offering the first issue of each comic free . AHOY Comics , which began publishing in September , is more old school , but it is trying new thing : It includes extra material — prose story , cartoon , even a crossword — in it issue , and is also publishing Second Coming , a comic book featuring Jesus Christ , in July .
 AWA ha it own biblical title , Archangel 8 , which is written by Michael Moreci and is about one of God ’ s angel who go rogue .
 To help shape the comic , the publisher ha a creative council , which includes the screenwriter and director Reginald Hudlin , the novelist Margaret Stohl and Gregg Hurwitz , the comic book writer Garth Ennis and J. Michael Straczynski , a screenwriter and co-creator of Netflix ’ s “ Sense8 . ”
 Straczynski took a sabbatical from comic about three year ago , but kept busy working on multiple project : an autobiography , a novel and a screenplay , adapting his Rising Stars comic book series for MGM . “ I wa open to returning to comic if the project wa something challenging , so when Bill and Axel approached me about creating an entirely new , cohesive , shared comic-book universe , the prospect wa too much fun to resist , ” he wrote in an email . Straczynski ha developed the origin point of AWA ’ s superheroes .
 He ha worked for comic company with different publishing model . At DC and Marvel , “ you always kind of know where the guard rail are , ” he noted , including an obligation to bend , but not break the character . With creator-owned work , “ you can go a far a you want , since only you bear the consequence if you mess it up , ” he wrote . Straczynski wa drawn to the blended approach of AWA . “ You get to create a new universe for what ha every opportunity to become a major company , while taking real chance . ”
 In developing AWA ’ s superhero universe , Straczynski and Alonso took a broad look at others . Straczynski postulated that DC ’ s hero , which generally emerged out of the postwar ’ 40 , were largely authority figure , while Marvel ’ s , which mostly emerged from the ’ 60 , were anti-establishment . “ Who are we writing our story about , and for , and what are we trying to say that ’ s relevant to a contemporary audience ? ” he wrote .
 AWA ha big ambition and hope to create a library of material like that of Marvel . “ I think it ’ s fairly safe to say that Marvel is the most valuable entertainment franchise in the world , ” Miller said . After the Netflix deal , he wondered if there were similar opportunity . He and Jemas got together , and Alonso soon joined them . “ One of the great thing about doing thing this way is that you get to try a lot . Some thing will hit , you never know when and where , but that ’ s part of the idea , ” he said . “ As long a you keep getting your turn at bat , then you ’ ll get some hit . ”
 An earlier version of this article misidentified Bill Jemas ’ s role at Marvel . He wa chief operating officer and publisher , not a vice president .

 Ever since Christopher Nolan took Batman to their mutually productive dark place , the DC cinematic super-universe ha been a somber a a grave . There have been exception , shimmer of light amid the doom . Outside the animated realm , though , the story and mood have been downbeat , matched by hue that range from drab to black amid bilious green , raging purple and watery blue . Even the “ S ” on Superman ’ s chest look drained of cheer , more like dried blood than some candy-colored delight .
 Given this , the bright , popping red of the superhero costume in “ Shazam ! ” is an early warning sign , a obvious a a matador ’ s cape , that the dreary and crepuscular have given way to something le self-serious and end-of-the-world grim . It ’ s a nice change of pace for a big-screen mega-comic , if not a revolutionary shift . There are still a lot of brand shilling and the usual tediously overextended fight , ka-pow and ka-boom . But these are delivered via Shazam , a charmingly breezy avenger in tights once known a Captain Marvel , a.k.a . the World ’ s Mightiest Mortal , or a I thought of him going in : Who ?
 The answer emerges piecemeal in “ Shazam ! , ” another movie about a superhero with dual-identity issue . Here , the divided self begin with Billy ( Asher Angel , a relaxed , natural presence ) , a foundling with pluck , heart and a sob story . He ’ s on a mission to find his mother ( longish story ) , a journey that — a sometimes happens in male quest — lead him to a surrogate father . This one is an ancient wizard called , ta-da , Wizard ( Djimon Hounsou in a comic Halloween-ish get-up ) , who pass his magic to Billy . Once back in his normal realm , Billy discovers that he can tap great power by saying the word “ shazam , ” which turn him into a hero with an adult body ( Zachary Levi ) .
 If this sound familiar — the Moses-like savior who learns he ’ s meant for greatness — it ’ s because the character wa conceived to compete with Superman . Yet because Shazam isn ’ t a well known a Supes et al. , he ’ s not a weighed down with fan expectation , the fate of the world and auteurist aspiration . The filmmaker ( Henry Gayden wrote the script , David F. Sandberg directed ) adhere to the heroic template , which mean there ’ s a regulation villain ( the reliably watchable Mark Strong ) with scheme . But they also fill in the face and place , and add enough shading and color to Billy ’ s world that when his inevitable fight against evil happens it feel a if something more than the box office is at stake .
 Of course a franchise may be at stake , though considering how often the movie name drop Batman and Superman , it can ’ t help but feel a if the entire DC movie world is on the line . And maybe Shazam is a risk , just because he ’ s an unfamiliar avenger in a wildly overcrowded field . Created in 1939 , the character wa originally called Captain Marvel ( and physically modeled on the actor Fred MacMurray ) . But for legal reason , Captain Marvel went into storage only to be later resurrected by DC a Shazam . ( DC ’ s longtime foe , Marvel Comics , managed to trademark the character ’ s first name for the avenger currently played by Brie Larson in “ Captain Marvel . ” )
 The new movie quickly dust off the Shazam story , first by grounding it in Billy , a sweet , if somewhat melancholic mischief maker who soon becomes an appealing protagonist . The opening scene involving a couple of dimwit cop feel a ancient a a Bowery Boys movie , perhaps intentionally . Things soon settle into an easy , everyday groove when Billy move into a new foster home , a sprawl populated by kid ( Jack Dylan Grazer , among them ) who are generally cute instead of cutesy . Tenderly overseen by Rosa and Victor ( Marta Milans and Cooper Andrews ) , the house ha a lived-in coziness , a warmth and security that feel a unforced a the mix of ethnicity and race .
 Once Billy say that magic word and his supersized alter ego appears , the movie go to it happy place and comfortably embrace it own identity a a light , jocular , modest entertainment . Levi is best known for his television role ( “ Chuck , ” “ The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel ” ) , but he easily scale up for the big screen . He can look like a beefier , tougher John Krasinski ; a Shazam , though , Levi is pure cartoon , from his bootblacked helmet of hair to his tumescent musculature . Ken-doll plastic and handsome , he is an ideal , suitably absurd figure on which to hang an old-fashioned hero with a satiny high-collared cape and a fat yellow arrow suggestively pointing down .
 The arrow is a winking joke and a subtle a the nod to the Tom Hanks body-swapping comedy “ Big. ” It ’ s also a reminder of Billy ’ s larger human journey , a metamorphosis that remains humorously , identifiably awkward , even a he will his inner super-adult to heroic life . Angel ’ s performance lay the groundwork for the character — and keep him tethered to reality — while Levi lift Shazam up with an exuberant turn that conveys the delight of Billy ’ s extreme transformation a well a it lingering adolescent ungainliness and excess . It ’ s one thing to fight evil , but Shazam ’ s eye-popping , slack-jawed , discordant physicality is a reminder that it ’ s just a tough to get a grip on yourself .
 An earlier version of this review misidentified the character that once earned fan like Elvis Presley . It wa Captain Marvel Jr. , not Captain Marvel .

 Jordan Peele is holding a new mirror up to society , and this weekend proved just how many moviegoer want a look at it reflection .
 Universal ’ s “ Us , ” the latest politically resonant horror movie from Peele , sold an estimated $ 70.3 million in ticket over the weekend , easily leading the domestic box office and more than doubling the opening-weekend ticket sale of $ 33.4 million for Peele ’ s smash-hit directorial debut , “ Get Out . ”
 It make sense that audience were primed to see “ Us ” : When “ Get Out ” wa released , Peele wa still best known for sketch comedy , not directing horror movie . The runaway success of “ Get Out ” ( it went on to gross around $ 175 million ) wa a product of euphoric review and strong word-of-mouth a the movie dominated the cultural discussion in the day and week after it release .
 [ Read how Lupita Nyong ’ o created that creepy voice . ]
 Even so , few predicted this level of success for “ Us. ” Analysts expected it first-weekend ticket sale to land closer to the $ 40 million mark .
 The movie star Lupita Nyong ’ o , Winston Duke , Shahadi Wright Joseph and Evan Alex a a family tormented by their evil , scissor-wielding doppelgängers . The film ’ s generally strong review ( it hold a 94 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes ) likely helped sustain excitement going into this weekend ; many critic said the movie is both scarier and more ambitious than “ Get Out , ” although perhaps lacking that film ’ s clarity .
 [ Read our critic ’ s review of “ Us . ” ]
 The promise of Peele ’ s scares-with-a-message wa more than enough to deliver “ Us ” the No . 1 spot . It unseated Disney ’ s “ Captain Marvel , ” which landed in second place with about $ 35 million in it third weekend , according to Comscore , which compiles box-office data .
 Both “ Us ” and “ Captain Marvel ” are diverse movie , with the former led by black actor and a black director and the latter starring a female superhero , the first Marvel Cinematic Universe film to do so .
 Third place went to Paramount ’ s animated “ Wonder Park , ” which sold $ 9 million in ticket . And CBS Films and Lionsgate ’ s romantic drama “ Five Feet Apart ” came in a close fourth , with about $ 8.8 million . Both of those movie were in their second weekend .

 You can be forgiven if you feel a if you ’ ve seen it all before when you start watching the new trailer for “ Avengers : Endgame. ” Disney ha already released two other promotional clip for it forthcoming superhero movie , and the latest us footage from previous film going all the way back to “ Iron Man , ” which officially kicked off the Marvel Cinematic Universe in 2008 .
 As Tony Stark ( Robert Downey Jr. ) himself put it , “ God , it seems like a thousand year ago , I fought my way out of that cave , became Iron Man. ” Scenes from later film in the series , including “ Captain America : The First Avenger ” and “ Thor , ” follow .
 It all seemingly culminates with the conclusion to the cliffhanger from last year ’ s “ Avengers : Infinity War , ” in which many of the titular crime-fighters disintegrated , and the survivor vowed to , yes , avenge their apparent death .
 Finally , after the film ’ s title flash on the screen , there ’ s a new face : Captain Marvel ( Brie Larson ) — fresh off her $ 500 million-plus opening week at the worldwide box office — appears , and Thor ( Chris Hemsworth ) declares , “ I like this one . ”
 Whether moviegoer have a similar feeling about “ Avengers : Endgame ” will be determined when the film hit theater on April 26 .

 On it opening day on March 8 , “ Captain Marvel , ” starring Brie Larson , became the first film in the Marvel movie franchise to focus principally on a woman . In light of this historic moment , we wanted to know : Does the gender of a superhero matter ? Do we need more female superheroes ?
 We asked student and they responded with mixed reaction . An overwhelming majority said , yes , equitable gender representation can have profound societal and personal impact . But others argued that the Marvel Universe is a business , “ not an activist group. ” Still others said we have more important thing to worry about than what gender our superheroes are .
 Representation matter — we need more female superheroes !
 Do we need more female superheros ? Yes , yes and YES ! ! Representation is essential in all form of medium . While I ’ d like to say that I don ’ t factor in thing like gender or race when I look at a character , I do notice those thing . It ’ s nice when a character look like me , or ha similar problem . You connect more to a character when they remind you of yourself .
 — Ashley Anderson , Hoggard High School , NC
 It ’ s been proven that without role for others to look up to , many won ’ t go against the tide ; a rule that can be spoken for the same aspect of race and sexuality . Seeing people like u in a position of power , success , wealth help u to dream , to learn . Without female superheroes , girl wouldn ’ t be encouraged to empower themselves or fellow woman . They wouldn ’ t want to become the superheroes of our society : the lawyer , the police woman , the fire woman , the doctor . When you don ’ t see people that are like you - struggling , flawed , anti-heroic - it ’ s difficult to accept who you are , to love yourself for who you are . Female superheroes give girl , boy , and everyone in between the knowledge that you can be whoever or whatever you wish .
 — Alexandria , Lakewood , OH
 … When boy and girl see superhero movie portraying both powerful men and woman , they develop more of a notion that men and woman have equal role in society . This allows them to believe that one group doe not dominate over the other ; rather , men and woman can work with each other to better the society in which we live . Marvel superhero movie are one step in developing an understanding of woman a resilient , courageous , and positive role model for the general public and for young child and teenager . According to Dave Itzkoff , the essential change that is beginning to include both gender is “ slow but it ’ s happening. ” Through their recent addition of more woman who share quality of brave leader , Marvel is helping to create a society where men and woman are both seen a superheroes .

 Representation is always going to be important in all medium , especially the film industry . It mean a lot to child to be able to relate to character that they admire , especially superheros . When Wonder Woman came out , my younger sister were so excited . They hadn ’ t really liked superhero movie before they watched wonder woman , but after I watched them talk about the movie in such an awed and inspired way . Even I could feel the effect of seeing someone that I could relate to on screen . We felt empowered , like there wa nothing that could stop u .
 — Keira Braithwaite , Hoggard High
 Allowing increased representation for historically disadvantaged group is a vital priority for Hollywood during this monumental cultural moment . Though it may sound surprising , the entertainment industry ’ s history of discrimination and institutional issue explains Marvel ’ s decade-long wait to release superhero film that don ’ t focus on white male character .
 A year ago , Black Panther permanently impacted popular culture with it groundbreaking image of African heroism and massive box-office success . Similarly , Captain Marvel will symbolize a long-awaited moment of superhero representation , this time for woman rather than African-Americans . If the film becomes another ground-breaking success , it could shatter the “ fallacy ” that “ while woman will watch movie about men , men will not watch movie about women. ” Black Panther connected with million of moviegoer , some of whom felt seen like never before and others who were white but still loved the film .
 Greater diversity is crucial in all area of medium but Marvel is crucially different . The studio ha created some of the biggest blockbuster of the last ten year . Each release is a seismic , must-see event . Marvel is in the position of creating image that will empower and influence the current generation of viewer a they follow in the footstep of their favorite character . Many people argue that viewer should not focus on the gender and race of fantasy character . In 2019 , though , representation is still essential .

 I am excited for captain Marvel , I know it is going to be a success and I am happy that little girl can go see it and see a strong female role model . What made me mostly happy wa that when I heard the name Captain marvel I immediately thought it wa a man . This show breaking gender stereotype in the film industry .
 — Mariska , Masterman school , Philly
 As with most thing , of course woman need more representation in the superhero field . I asked the 5 people in my house ( not including me ) who their favorite superhero wa . The answer I got wa what I expected ; four people said that their favorite superhero wa a man . Well then who wa the only person who named a female superhero , you ’ re probably wondering ? That person wa my 6 year old cousin , who is a boy . Even when I gave him no context to my intention , he still said that Wonder Woman wa his favorite superhero …
 Then , I started thinking : if young child are exposed to both male and female superheroes , maybe they could make their own decision . It is not the child ’ s fault if they are not exposed to all gender of superheroes ; it ’ s the producer ’ . There is dozen of superhero movie with male lead , and barely any female lead superhero movie . I think this is because superheroes are mostly considered a “ boy activity ” , so they think that a woman superhero will eliminate their prime audience . However , Wonder Woman made approximately 821 million dollar in the box office . There is no excuse anymore , and so I think Marvel and D.C. will continue to make more female lead production , because success is proven .
 — Rylee Porter , J.R Masterman , Philadelphia
 The gender of a comic character doe not matter but there ha to be diversity . I do believe we need more strong-willed female superheroes because they can serve a an inspiration to young girl . Captain Marvel go through a journey to find who she really is and is sending the message to young girl a well a an older woman . Her message is to have other woman know that they are naturally strong and to not listen to those who say that they are “ not strong enough ” and that they do not “ belong ” in certain group or area of life .
 — Mikhaela , Providence
 With the upcoming movie , Captain Marvel and all the rumor of Black Widow going around it really doe feel that change is happening in our world for the better . A change that make young girl realize that they don ’ t have to wait for Superman when they can be their own hero .
 — Audrey E. , Hoggard High School , Wilmington NC
 … But not just any female superheroes
 In previous Marvel movie , woman have been treated like accessory , a way to move the plot along for the purpose of a man . Black Widow , another female superhero , ha never had a stand alone film , even though she ’ s been in the franchise for almost a long a Iron Man . In previous movie by Marvel , the woman are often only love interest , and if they are not , they are over-sexualized . I think the success of Captain Marvel will show Marvel and other big company , that people will watch female superheroes without them being sexualized or a love interest . Captain Marvel is my favorite superhero , let alone female superhero , and the reason behind that is that when I look at her , I see a woman that I can look up to in life for simply being who she is .
 — Angela Froming , School of the Woods , Houston , TX
 By over-saturating the super hero industry with lack luster , lazy and forgettable woman hero , Marvel and other movie studio are making woman super hero look bad . I believe that woman hero are a great addition to any super hero universe … And while I do not believe we have never seen a successful super hero movie that star a woman , the majority of these film are overwhelmingly bad .
 So how should we fix this ? I do not propose that we give up this effort . It is much needed for female leadership in a country of mostly male in those position . But there need to be more dignity and thought that go into these movie . The hero herself should be a more well developed , interesting character . The story that surround her should be le corny and cliche . And the time it take to write these movie should be longer , in order to ensure that maximum thought and effort wa poured into creating the most impactful and influential woman hero that they can .
 — Ezra Lombardi
 I don ’ t feel that the gender of a superhero matter at all . What I think really matter is what the power of the hero are and the hero role . Marvel in general ha a lot of very powerful character that are female . For example , in Avengers Infinity War Black Widow , Scarlet Witch and Okoye take down Proxima Midnight . All of the character in this fight seen are woman and have extraordinary role . Black Widow is an assassin , Scarlet Witch can pretty much warp reality , Okoye is a courageous warrior who ha been called one of the best ever in Wakanda and lastly Proxima Midnight ha superhuman ability like enhanced strength and agility . Even though they don ’ t currently have their own movie they play humongous role in the MCU . I think that the Captain Marvel Movie will just push the female superhero role movement over the edge . I think having a movie revolved all around a female superhero is great and I look forward to seeing it in the near future .
 — Kenneth R. , Masterman School , Philadelphia
 I believe that Captain Marvel will be a great representation because it not only a superhero movie , but a movie about a female superhero that ha an interesting story . That is so important because throughout history child look up to superheroes and little girl having a superhero who is a positive role model that ’ s like them . By having a movie with a female lead , it can inspire girl and show them what “ female leadership look like . ”
 — Lola Adebayo , Providence , RI
 I think that a long a a character ha an interesting backstory and an interesting personality they ’ re cool . The gender or race of a character shouldn ’ t matter . If a movie is only created to have minority ( female and non-white people ) it would be boring . It would be tokenism , which is much more offensive than blatant sexism .
 — Ami S , Masterman , Philadelphia
 Marvel is in the business of entertainment , not politics .
 I don ’ t understand why people take these movie and blast them to proportion that are way bigger than they should be . Comic book movie are made for entertainment , it doesn ’ t matter what kind of character get the movie whether they are black , Hispanic , female , or even a Norse god . People will often see a movie like “ Wonder Woman ” and say that it wa a really big leap for woman when in reality DC wa just making a movie for one of it popular character , the movie said nothing about sexism and it didn ’ t even have that kind of undertone and I think that ’ s what made the movie good . People don ’ t go to the movie for politics they go to the movie to be entertained , it shouldn ’ t matter whether the movie ha a female lead the only thing that should matter is that it ’ s entertaining .
 — Wyatt Young , Hoggard High School
 While it is an ideal to strive for , I believe that Marvel hold no moral responsibility towards the compensatory representation of woman in the pursuit of equal gender representation . The entire purpose of their film , and more generally , artistic medium , is to create a meaningful experience and to invoke emotion , not to regurgitate the political climate of the current time .
 As said within the article , there wa a leak from a 2014 email , “ from Isaac Perlmutter , the chairman of Marvel Entertainment , in which he disparaged female superhero film like ‘ Supergirl ’ ( 1984 ) , ‘ Catwoman ’ ( 2004 ) and ‘ Elektra ’ ( 2005 ) for their poor box-office performance ” ( Itzkoff ) . Mr. Perlmutter ’ s remark might have seemed distasteful , but the fact of the matter is that he wa simply doing his job . As CEO of the Marvel company , he wa looking out for the best interest of the corporation .
 — Andrei Mistreanu , Hoggard High School , Wilmington , NC
 These are business , not activist group . What is the Avengers without Captain America ? What is the Justice League without Superman ? A superhero isn ’ t determined by their gender . The time were different when the majority of our beloved superhumans were created . Captain America wa created in the 40 ’ s . Captain Marvel wa first introduced a the main protagonist in 1967 . Marvel and DC shouldn ’ t be pressured to star a female just because they are a female . To quote Megamind , “ hero aren ’ t made , they ’ re born. ” When a superhero is chosen for a movie , they should have proved their merit and have an interesting story , not just exist a one gender or the other . We do not NEED more female superheroes . We do not NEED Marvel or DC . We do NEED to let these independent company choose the right person to wow u on the big screen .
 — Brian Marks , John T Hoggard Wilmington NC
 I never got why the gender of a superhero mattered . Why should it ? So why do people make a big deal over gender ? Whenever I watch a Marvel movie , I never think to myself “ Hey that ’ s a female superhero ” or “ There need to be more woman ” . I believe that we should have more female representation , but we ’ re going about this all wrong . One problem is the hype around the movie just because she ’ s a woman . Marvel is likely doing this just for money . They hold back on female representation so that when they finally release a movie focused on a woman , people go nut and turn up just to support the character being a woman … Instead of focusing everything on female character , focus if the movie is good or not . It will do so much more for female representation in superhero movie to just make a good movie .
 — Keegan Butler , Danvers MA
 Women and girl have more important work to do .
 To be frank , I think this is a topic that ha been blown out of proportion . There are so many other way that woman ( the one in real life , not the imaginary one in comic ) are being discriminated against . Women make about 75 cent to a man dollar and we a a whole country have problem respecting woman . Even with the MeToo movement , catcalling and sexual harassment are still huge issue plaguing american woman . Being represented in Superhero movie is at the bottom of my to-do list a a blooming feminist . First , let ’ s get equal pay and learn to respect woman ’ s choice regarding their own body , among other thing , then we can worry about how many female superhero movie there are in comparison to male .

 The “ ultimate superhero ”
 When I think about the “ ultimate superhero , ” I only think about my mother . Superheros are known to have honorable quality . They are selfless people , and to me , so are mother . Most woman only give of themselves . They give birth , become mother , raise family , etc . They in fact spend so much time taking care of others , they find no time taking care of themselves . Although mother might not stop an oncoming villain , they do protect , and raise those of our future , which to me is no different .
 My mother ha always been there for me no matter how “ moody ” I get . I remember talking back to her constantly about cleaning my room and despite my hateful attitude she never gave up , she always showed grace . She pushed me to not only clean my room , but to take care of my thing , which ha later benefited me in many way . She pushed me to reach out of my “ villain ” costume , and find my inner hero !
 … Without mother , we wouldn ’ t have a future . They raise and produce , our next generation . They make , and save life everywhere , with or without a cape . They are the real hero ’ s .

 “ There they were , having fun without me , ” college student Hallie Reed writes in “ They Left Me Out , and I Saw It All , ” an essay about the time she found out all her friend were hanging out without her . In this Student Opinion question , we asked student if they ’ ve ever had an experience like this and , if so , how they dealt with it .
 After reading over 100 comment , we found out that Ms. Reed is not alone . Many student had a painful story to tell about being excluded , whether it wa a memory from first grade or a slight that stung just last week . Below , their story — of being left out , of doing the leaving out themselves , and of learning hard but useful lesson from the experience .
 It hurt .
 Statistics show how social medium can even increase level in anxiety and depression which in my opinion , is very accurate . It ’ s hard not to feel even a little disappointed when you ’ re scrolling and you see a picture of a group of people from your school , smiling left to right . Then you look around to see your lonely room and you can compare yourself to the people on the internet .

 My usual Friday night are absolutely miserable . I usually spend it sitting on my bed reading or stuck in my bedroom fiddling with my robot . I spend these night alone , kept company by my mind solely . But that ’ s not the miserable part . Being alone is something that I have become used to , and started to take a liking to . The bad part is when my parent ask what my friend are doing , and I am always forced to respond with “ I don ’ t know. ” In their voice and face after I say that , I see , hear , and feel sadness , and it seeps into my mind . It make me believe that I have no friend , and that I socially amount to nothing .
 When someone else point out your loneliness , it make it 100 time worse . Just recently , I wa a part of a group conversation . A few joke were made that I did not understand at all , and I seemed to be the only one not getting . I realized that they all had a group chat , all 13 of them . I immediately felt like in their mind , they didn ’ t really consider me a one of them , or at least not good enough to be on the chat . It made me feel worthless and unimportant . I have not , and do not plan on , making a comment , because what if they said no ? Or worse , said yes with hesitation ? The even slight possibility of social humiliation is enough for me to say nothing .

 When you tell your friend an idea of having a bonfire in the summer , suddenly your friend had gone ghost , then you watch your friend on social medium at the bonfire , without you . It will make you have an internal feeling of not having anyone , isolation , abandonment . Leaving you to assume that you are not good enough to hang with the crew , trying to pretend like you are not bothered by the isolation . The feeling of isolation and abandonment will make you think about walking right out of their life all from betrayal .

 “ Bye Marta , Chiara and Ali , I hope you guy have a great weekend . ”
 These three girl were what I considered best friend for most of my life . ” Come on girl , we are going to be late to get parking space at the beach. ” My grandpa drove u to the beach on Friday afternoon and quickly , this became our tradition . When the day of his passing came around , they were the first one there to visit me at the hospital.From that point on , I knew friendship couldn ’ t get better than this.I wa walking down the carline opening the door to my mom car , I turned around to realize that Marta ’ s car had two other people in it , even though she had told me her weekend wa going to be a “ girl trip ” with her sister Gaia , at a beach house . I wa convinced that it wa Gaia ’ s friend last minute deciding to go on the beach trip . I soon realized I wa too blinded by the “ best friend promises. ” I checked instagram a a new post appeared on my feed . “ Wouldn ’ t want to hang out with any other people. ” -Marta . This quote wa captioned under a picture of the beach spot my grandfather always brought all three of u to . My heart shattered in a million piece because I felt like I lost my three best friend . They ruined the only place left that reminded me of my grandfather . We all lost a part of ourselves that day .

 Recently , I came to school and met my friend a usual . It wa a Monday , and I thought it had been a normal weekend , with no big plan or party , but I wa wrong . My friend came up to me , showing me a video of her and some of our other friend . “ Look , ” She said , “ We went bowling on Saturday . It wa so much fun ! ” I looked at the video , laughed , and tried to shrug it off . It didn ’ t work . I kept thinking about it , wondering why I wasn ’ t invited . I knew I shouldn ’ t dwell on it , but I couldn ’ t let it go . I felt that short moment of sadness that make you feel inferior . I know I have been left out before , and I know I will be many more time in my life . I only hope I will learn to get over it , and cherish having friend , even if I don ’ t spend every weekend with them .

 7th grade I thought I had found my people , I felt at home … almost like at peace . All wa fine for a while , we ’ d talk all the time , do everything together , but at school only . It never occurred to me that they never invited me to do anything out of school ; I had an odd feeling in the back of my mind , suspecting it , but thought nothing of it . Fast forward maybe a couple month into the school year , one of the girl in my friend group ha a big birthday party each year , and invite everyone … except me . I never would ’ ve known either , had it not been for Snapchat story depicting my so called friend having a great time without me . Immediately , I ditched them for other acquaintance I had made . They then became my close friend , who actually valued me a a friend . Although it really hurt , I ’ m glad I had this experience with these awful girl . It made me get a good look on society , people being mean for the pure fun of it … what are you gaining ? I have bad social anxiety because of this experience , it make keeping relationship hard . But , it ’ s shaped me into a good soul . Being the pity friend enables you to be a wonderful friend to people who are worth it .

 I remember one night during my junior year of high school , I wa having a little bit of a depressive episode . I tried to text my best friend since I usually talk to her to distract myself or to ask for advice . She didn ’ t answer my text right away which wa fine , so I opened Snapchat and started swiping through people ’ s story . On her story wa a picture of her , her boyfriend , and all of our friend hanging out together at my ex boyfriend ’ s house for our friend group ’ s annual badminton tournament . I had participated the last few year and nothing bad happened between u at all so I didn ’ t know why I wasn ’ t being included .
 I ignored it for a while . I pretended that I wa okay with being cut out of our friend group . I kept this up for a while until I heard them making plan in front of me like I wasn ’ t even there.For a while , I wandered around on the outside of that friend group before leaving it completely .

 It happened actually two week ago . I wa all by myself playing solo on Fortnite . I saw my friend list and seeing a lot of people in my friend ’ s list . I noticed that they are all in squad . I wa all by myself . Until my friend , Amit , join my party . I wa so happy until he told me , he had to leave for his girlfriend . I wa by myself for the rest of the night . I just can ’ t believe it , and I thought to myself why am I so sad . I waited for Amit to join . When he finally did , he did squad with someone else . I wa devastated , and my heart shattered through sadness .

 Back when I wa in first grade , I wa left out by EVERYBODY , and this is no exaggeration . Apparently , in the first week of my first grade year , there were uncanny rumor spreading about me . Due to this , the kid avoided me like I wa a cockroach . When there wa an upcoming party , they would talk about it excitedly except for me . When the kid were playing soccer , I would have to force my way into the game just to touch the ball . It wa never a good experience , and I wonder even now what I could have done to avoid it . I tried to ignore it , trying to believe that the kid would stop with their nonsense , but in the end , the rumor got worse and worse while the kid would become more distant towards me . The only choice I had wa to tell my parent and teacher so that everything is solved .
 Although it did , it took the kid around 3 month before they finally started accepting me .

 I do kind of feel like I ’ m being left out of my friend group on a daily basis though . It ’ s a common recurrence that I am ignored or talked over when hanging out with my friend . I ’ m not sure if I ’ m just not talking loud enough or if they don ’ t care enough to listen to what I have to say . I ’ m definitely not exaggerating when I say it happens everyday , several time a day . It ’ s gotten to the point that whenever I do talk and I ’ m talked over or ignored by said friend , they apologize and allow me to say what I wa trying to say . They still haven ’ t stopped interrupting or talking over me , but I think they ’ re trying ? I don ’ t know .

 There wa time in my life where I asked my friend if they wanted to come to my birthday party each one of them said they couldn ’ t come because there were going out of town , and I thought to myself it ’ s not a big deal right ? 4 day have passed and today is my birthday and I wa turning 11 . I went on my Instagram and I saw a post of my friend and I wasn ’ t in the post . The picture wa all of the at one of my friend party . I went into my room and started to cry and it really did hurt really bad to be left out . My tear wouldn ’ t stop and I wa just sad and I cried for hour and eventually I went to sleep . My reaction to when I saw the post I just didn ’ t know what to do and when the day they told me they couldn ’ t go I just told my mom to cancel the party . I wa really upset about it because I never felt this way before . Later on that day I just kept thinking and thinking about and I still think about still today.Then the next day came and it wa Monday and I saw all of my friend hanging out so I walked up to them and said How come you guy didn ’ t come to my birthday party ? They all said they were sick and I said I thought you guy were out of town.So I just told them I know you guy hang out together and if you guy don ’ t want to be my friend anymore or don ’ t want to hang out just tell me instead of lying to me .

 A couple year back , I wa extremely introverted . An introvert is a person who get tired from social interaction , or just a follower . I wasn ’ t very confident , or strong . I wa basically a pushover . My two close “ friend ” had left to another school , but there were moment where I felt left out of the conversation or just ignored when we hung out . After they had left to a different middle school , I felt suddenly lost . I found a different group of people , but the leader kept leaving me , and the others followed suit . I found the better side of her , and we became close friend . The entire experience made me stronger a a person , and even still , there are incident where I am still left out.Most of the time , I get this sick feeling whenever I am left out . I start to wonder if I wa the problem and not my friend . If maybe , they were doing this because I had said something to them , or been mean . I still feel like this almost every day . It is hard to shake off .
 — Rose Candelaria , Oak Grove Elementary School
 One really bad thing I do is when I am left out , I should put my phone down and not pay attention to those people , but instead I stay on it and kind of stalk those people social medias so I know exactly what I missed out on . I know I shouldn ’ t do that and it just make me more upset about it but I still do it .

 In the past six month , I felt farther away from my friend than ever . There became a time where instead of hanging at the beach , they wanted spend their time abusing substance and leaving me behind . At first I just let it be , but once it started affecting our other friend , I decided to call them out on it . It ruined everything . The distance between u became greater and I wa left all alone . These girl had always been my best friend but now I don ’ t think it can ever return to the way it wa .

 It ’ s not always what it seems .
 I became super close with two friend during my first year at a new school . We spent numerous weekend together . We spent holiday together . We spent break together . We formed this super close group with each other , and I had never imagined a falling out a a possibility . We began to grow , and we grew in different way . I became very detached from them . I slowly started hanging out with others and isolating myself from them . At the time I did not think anything of it . They started posting on social medium without me , which caused my perspective quickly changed . I grew angry with them . Why were they excluding me ? Did I not get the invite ? I questioned their every move . I felt like a detective , I wa trying to find the missing clue . I slowly realized what the missing piece wa : myself . It became apparent that I wa the one causing the separation . I wa the one turning down the invitation . I wa the one not responding to the text . I wa the problem . I decided to try to become a better friend . I wanted to be included again , but a it turn out , I did not want to be included . The time apart caused our friendship to falter . It wa a if I did not know them anymore . When we get excluded from thing , we need to look at it a an opportunity to examine ourselves , or we can grow and move on .

 When I wa about 12 year old , one of my close friend had thrown a birthday party , without inviting me . seeing all my close friend having what seemed to be the time of their life , over a snapchat story , gave me immense anxiety . I started thinking that it wa my own fault that I didn ’ t get an invite . when later I had come to find out that the girl parent had got my mailing address wrong when they sent the invitation . I had created this load of anxiety on myself for no reason . I had questioned myself , instead of questioning the source of my anxiety : my close friend .

 One of the most memorable moment of my ‘ left-outness ’ actually did not occur because of something I saw on social medium , but literally right in front of my face . Two of my best-friends were making plan together , and I wasn ’ t included . Thinking about it now , I ’ ve realized they didn ’ t invite me because of me , it ’ s that they didn ’ t have another ticket to the baseball game , and I don ’ t even enjoy watching baseball that much . Even though I ’ ve realized this now , in the moment , I felt terrible honestly . It made me feel sad , and angry , and confused , and a the passive aggressive and non confrontational person I am , it resulted in me swearing them off in my head and then proceeding to call my mom to pick me up .
 — Sara Desrocher , Massachusetts
 Being left out can be one of the worst feeling to experience . I have been left out numerous of time like Ms. Reed . A few time it ha been my own fault for denying the invitation but that wa due to my anxiety holding me back and preventing me from partaking in the activity . But at time I hoped that I received the text “ Hey want to hang out today ? ” Instead I had to find out a different way . I used to open snapchat and see video of the both of them laughing together either in the car , at the pool , trying on dress on or just eating together . One day I confronted them about it and the word “ we didn ’ t think you ’ d want to come ” hurt more than I expected it to .
 — Arendy , Providence
 I ’ ve been the one doing the leaving out .
 Two summer ago I took a trip to New York and invited two of my closest friend to join me . Trust me if I could have taken more I would have because it killed me knowing I wa leaving some of my friend out , but the decision had to be made . Sometimes you just can ’ t invite everyone , and it hurt not only the other person , but you . I felt guilty in a sense that I let my friend down . I have the most amazing friend , but our only problem is that there are so many of u and it ’ s a challenge taking everyone everywhere .
 — Gracie Sistrunk , Hoggard High School , Wilmington , NC
 When I need to exclude people I feel really bad about it . Personally , I like to take the honest approach and tell them the truth . “ I ’ m sorry Dylan , but my mom said I can only have a few people over. ” “ Sorry Kate , I think just the guy are gon na hang tonight. ” I know that it stink when people say that you can ’ t go , but it is so much better than getting lied to . When someone tell you that you ’ re not invited somewhere you can get over that relatively quickly , but when you get lied to and excluded then you lose the ability to fully trust your friend . That ’ s the real killer .
 — Mike Mahoney , MA
 This summer , when I went to 6 Flags New England with my friend for my birthday , my parent had bought 15 ticket , and so I had to exclude some people from coming , and boy did I feel bad for those who I didn ’ t invite . It wa the first time that I had ever spearheaded an even that a group of u were hanging out and I did not really understand how bad it felt to not invite others . Since then , I have become much more lenient to those who don ’ t invite me to event , because I realize that it isn ’ t something personal against me , it could be a simple a it skipped their mind , or they weren ’ t allowed to invite many people . Covering it up by saying they can ’ t hang out I also find understandable . It can be hard to tell someone to their face that they aren ’ t invited to something .
 — Keegan Butler , Danvers
 The sad thing is I ’ ve been on the opposite side of the story sadly , multiple time . I ’ m sure you ’ ve done it without even thinking . Birthday party , trip , or even just going out to brunch . I didn ’ t care though , I didn ’ t want this girl to come to my party . She wa in my group at school , but not outside of school . We excluded her a lot . It didn ’ t even phase me until I wa put into that situation . I wa the one getting left out now . I felt what the girl felt pretty much every weekend . I suggest having many friend group , especially if you ’ re in high school , your “ friend ” drop like fly then . Keep a positive mind open and make new friend . That ’ s what I did and now I have multiple friend group and have many chance to hang out with them .

 On my 15th birthday I invited three girl from school over to celebrate and spend the night . We had volleyball the next morning , so it made sense just to keep it easy and invite them . One of my friend from school wa very upset she wa not invited , and she wa very short with me that day . I texted her and explained my reasoning for only inviting those few . She eventually understood . I don ’ t really have birthday party anymore ; someone always get left out .
 — Olivia Britt , Hoggard High School , Wilmington , NC
 Some positive came out of the experience for me .
 Being lonely is a choice . Life , for anyone , is an endless opportunity of everything and anything . The only thing stopping you is you , you limit yourself , with a positive look and good spirit you can go do anything , in the countless opportunity in life . If you cry and complain about the one you messed , you will miss even more by not moving on .
 — Cormac , Lakewood
 Feeling left out not only ha it negative , but also positive . It ’ s hard to swallow , but in some case feeling this way can help you structure your future . Everyone ha been left out at least once in their life and would be lying if said otherwise . It is a feeling one hate to feel , but is portrayed differently to me . I have realized quality over quantity within friend is crucial . The more fake people you surround yourself with , the more difficult situation you put yourself in .
 — Conor FitzGerald , Danvers
 … I realized everyone go through this feeling of being left out , even the one who are doing the leaving out . Therefore very recently I have moved past my fear of being left out and not having friend . Sometimes you just have to open your eye and realize the people who really are there for you and the one who aren ’ t and just move on .
 — Tamsie Black , Hoggard High School
 it always seems more fun when you aren ’ t there . This is always a crushing feeling to know that you are missing out on possible memory . The next time you see your friend is also odd , but it is important to remain normal about it . If you try to address the situation , it becomes more weird , and then they definitely won ’ t invite you next time . But most of all , it is important to remember that there will be a next time . There will always be another chance to hang out with friend and make memory . Even if it isn ’ t with the same group that once left you out .
 — Ezra , Lombardi
 I used to feel upset and like I wa missing out when I saw what others were doing on social medium . How could someone not feel left out when everyone else is having the time of their life ? But when I would go to thing , I realized people put on an act for the camera and it wasn ’ t a fun a the post made it seem . I started to grow out of being upset over every little event that I didn ’ t go to . I realized it is totally fine to not attend every party and that everything is not a it seems on social medium . Mixing the lack of reality portrayed on social medium and being an overdramatic sensitive teen , fear of missing out is almost impossible to not experience .
 — Sommerlyn Jones , Massachusetts
 Freshman year went by and I thought that I would never find genuine friend that would actually want to hang out with me . Eventually I connected with another person from that same middle school group that felt the same way I felt . I also got back in touch with an old friend from elementary school . Those shared feeling and old bond sparked a flame between u and our friendship blossomed . The tail end of sophomore year and the majority of my junior year ha been the best , friends-wise . I went through some feeling of being left out but I waited and pushed through and it paid off . In the end , I ’ m almost happy that I wa left out because it forced me to cut some people out of my life and discover my true friend .
 — Madison Prideaux , Boston , Mass .
 In reality most of the time they are just hanging around being bored and someone say “ it picture time. ” That ’ s when everybody get up make it look like they are having fun , and then when picture time is over everyone go back to being bored .
 — Sidney Holman , Northbrook , IL
 After year of looking on instagram and seeing them hanging out together , and posting it , I knew I had to stop it . I began by deleting instagram , I knew that I didn ’ t love the app enough to get hurt every time I opened it . I talked to my mom , who I grew distant from during my time of being hurt and confused . I made new friend and new connection . Now , I ’ m happy , although I don ’ t have instagram , I can still have fun and hang out with people who I know will not hurt me .
 — Izzy , California
 Shortly after getting rid of my social medium account a few year back , I began to realize just how big a role it played in that . In my opinion I think a good remedy to this awful feeling is simply cutting out social medium . If you think about it , you don ’ t start to feel bad until you actually see the post indicating you were left out . Now I know this isn ’ t an option for some people , so if you just can ’ t part with your account then maybe spare some other people that no good feeling . By this I mean don ’ t post a picture every time you go out , it ’ s a simple solution and could easily decrease the number of people who feel left out .

From the extravagant to the humble , student let their imagination run wild writing about the seven-story mansion , log cabin , cozy cottage and beach house they hope to one day call “ home . ”
 Fun house
 My home itself would be a modest 7 floor . The bottom floor would be for the swimming pool and lounge area . The second floor would house any guest and would have at least 5 bedroom . The third floor would be for a basketball court , and the fourth for a football field . The fifth floor would be a trampoline park and a movie theater . The sixth floor would have my master bedroom and the 7th floor would be the aquarium .
 — Ezra Lombardi
 … I love and have an absolute passion for music . I ’ d have one room for just a grand piano , guitar , trumpet , and saxophone - the instrument I play already - and one for every other instrument known to man . Instead of watching television when I had nothing to do I could just pick up a bassoon and stream tutorial . Across the hall from the these two room would be my recording studio . This is where I ’ d record album that I composed , played all the part , and sang .
 — Mike Mahoney , MA
 In the backyard there would also be soccer goal , basketball hoop and a volleyball net maybe even a tennis court somewhere . I would have a room with thing like a ping pong table and a pool table and another room kind of like a movie room but it would also have all of my video game .
 — Fernando R. , Providence
 Underneath the house there will be my very own bat cave where I can house all of my car and helicopter . The main house will have an indoor pool a well a a massive central fireplace and cozy bunk room . There will also be a bowling alley and movie theater in the main house . The tree house that will be nestled in the tree 50 foot above my house will contain the master bedroom . This room will have stunning view of the Colorado mountain and wilderness .
 — Declan Quinn , Danvers MA
 The kitchen would probably be one of the best area of the house . It would contain sundae bar along with aisle and aisle of candy . In addition to this , a personal chef-robot would be working , ready to cook up any meal at any time .
 — Gabriela Ferullo , Danvers , Massachusetts
 Simple pleasure
 I would never want a huge house because it ’ d feel to empty . However , I definitely want a house large enough to accommodate at least two kid , nicely , and with a few extra room for like a game room , a play room , a book room and a homework room . Also , I love cooking so the house will have to have a nicely sized kitchen . Nothing excessive though . Relatively simple is what I ’ m thinking .
 — Olivia Brooklynn , Providence
 My dream house is nothing special . It isn ’ t some billion dollar mansion with an ocean view . It isn ’ t some trendy contemporary apartment filled with expensive furniture and decoration . My dream house is something that feel like home . I want it to be a place of comfort ; I don ’ t want it to be a place where it sole purpose is to show off it luxury or expense .
 — Sommerlyn Jones , Massachusetts
 My dream home would be somewhere in the suburb , a very similar environment to where I live now . I want a big bedroom with a loft-style double bed , a desk underneath , wall full of art , and plenty of fairy light . I want my bedroom to feel comforting , and be a place I can go to get away from the outside world and relax .
 — Madison Prideaux , Boston , Massachusetts
 Outdoor paradise
 If I had the ability to have my dream home , I think the 10 year old in me would come out and I ’ d have water slide everywhere ! It would definitely be big and somewhere exotic , and near an ocean that ’ s turquoise so I could overlook it whenever I ’ d want . And I want to be able to run outside and in the next minute , have my foot buried in warm sand . But I also want a garden and a real backyard with grass so everyone can enjoy themselves .
 — Sarah Khan , Providence , RI
 I would love to live on the beach overlooking a nice private beach . I would have a lot of window , letting a lot of sun come in . I want my house to feel spacious , but not to the point of feeling too empty . I would want an infinity pool overlooking the beach and a lit up hot tub for the nighttime .
 — Conor FitzGerald , Danvers
 I want to have a huge yard . I want a cozy front yard with ton of plant leading the way up to the doorway and in my backyard I would want a pool and enough room to have a makeshift volleyball net put up . If I could , I would also want an above ground hot tub put on my porch . I would want a hand built fireplace outside in the backyard for late summer night .
 — Maddie Montanari , MA
 I would want my house to have both a front and back porch , a well a a large backyard , possibly with a jacuzzi . I would want to have a lot of window all throughout the house , and skylight window a well , so a much sunlight could come in a possible . I would want to fill the house with a many plant a possible , one hanging down from the ceiling , and potted plant on the floor . A garden outside , filled with wildflower , a bird bath , and bird seed would also be nice , because I like to be able to look out my window and see bird around .
 — Allison , MA
 Location , location , location
 My dream house would be a replica of my self-designed minecraft home . Naturally , the house would have to be located on the top of a mountain . This location would provide protection from my enemy and allow me to have abundant resource when I choose to go mining .
 — Richard Canova , Danvers , Massachusetts
 My dream home , though I love New England , would be located right on a beautiful beach in Malibu , California . Of course , the beach I would live on would have to have amazing wave 24/7 , so I could walk down to my surfboard hut , choose one of my 20 surfboard , and get to shredding .
 — Dan Rossitto , Danvers , MA
 Ideally I would be living in Georgia or South Carolina , wherever is warmer . I would have a nice , two story house on a big plot of land , where I would also have a bunch of animal . Although I would have a full time job , I would still like to take care of my cow , horse , rabbit , goat , chicken , and pig .
 — Caitlyn Pellerin , Danvers , MA
 When I imagine my dream home now , it would be something that ’ s a happy place for me , but also the environment . First of all , it would definitely be somewhere very serene and tranquil , maybe near a meadow , a river , a mountain ; I heard Montana is really pretty , so maybe there ? Where ever my home is , I would want it to be surrounded by nature .

 AUSTIN , Tex . — The Oscar-winning actress Charlize Theron traveled to South by Southwest over the weekend for the premiere of her new romantic comedy , “ Long Shot , ” in which she star a a presidential candidate opposite Seth Rogen a her speechwriter . The film open nationwide May 3 .
 We asked reader if they had any question for her during the festival , and I selected a handful of those to ask Theron on Saturday at the Four Seasons . She spoke about how “ Monster ” ( 2003 ) made her more empathetic , how her physical transformation for “ Tully ” took a toll and how she ’ s still waiting for a part in a Marvel movie . Here are edited excerpt from her response .
 Your performance in “ Monster ” wa an absolute tour de force . It felt to me a if you did much more than study Aileen Wuornos . It seemed a if you were able to connect with her psyche in some way . Can you talk about your connection to this role a bit more ? — Deb , Wilmington , Del .
 I think the more you embed yourself in the information you have access to , the more alive thing become underneath your skin .
 They executed Aileen on the day I said yes to the film . Patty Jenkins , who wrote and directed , had been writing her letter , but we never had the chance to meet with her . But her friend [ from ] her childhood year in Detroit became the custodian of her letter from prison . She invited u to her house and said , “ Look , you can have access to all of it . I ’ m not sending it to you and I ’ m not making copy . So Patty and I flew out to Flint , Mich. , and we spent three day in a guest bedroom , reading a many of Aileen ’ s letter a we possibly could to just try and understand her .
 Many actor mention how playing a role can sometimes impact their view on issue in the world . Have any of the role you ’ ve played had that effect on you , and if so which one , and in what way ? — Frank Komola , Bradford , Mass .
 Yes , I never really truly understood the difference between empathy and sympathy until I played Aileen . Once I empathized with her , I could understand her action a little bit more . And I think it ’ s sometimes a tricky thing to talk about , because we don ’ t want to ever justify this person ’ s action . But I remember being done with that movie and walking through my life in this world , traveling , going to Africa , and just really understanding the power of empathy and how , I don ’ t think , we encourage it enough .
 You ’ ve demonstrated your action-movie cred in about a half-dozen film , but haven ’ t yet appeared in a Marvel or DC project . Hard to believe you haven ’ t been asked , so what ’ s the story ? — Stu Freeman , Brooklyn
 That ’ s a question for Marvel . I ’ ve met with those guy and we ’ ve had some conversation , but I ’ ve never been offered anything . I would totally be open to it . That genre is becoming really fascinating to me , and that kind of physical storytelling is something that I ’ m really enjoying . So get with it , Marvel !
 Is there any physical change you won ’ t make to play a role ? — Lanie , San Antonio
 There ’ s nothing so far that a director ha asked of me that I ’ ve said no to . But for [ the 2018 movie ] “ Tully , ” I had gained all this weight and it wa really , really hard in my 40 to lose it . I did a lot of damage to my body and I definitely went through a period of full frustration where I wa like , I will never do that again . And then of course I know , if the right material came around , I would do it again in a heartbeat .
 The film industry seems to be making progress with more complex female acting role ( although there is still a lot to be done ) . But the industry still doe not have nearly enough female director . Why do you think it is so difficult for female director to succeed ? — Cristina Salazar , Baltimore
 We ’ ve gone through a very long period where woman weren ’ t supported in that job , and so now we ’ re in the recovery process . It ’ s great because of film festival like South by Southwest and Sundance and Telluride . There are more platform for filmmaker who haven ’ t had the opportunity in the last 20 or 30 year . And I also think the industry now understands the benefit . This stuff is not always generated by good thought and big heart . The industry is realizing that there is something to be monetized here and that woman are actually tapping into storytelling in a way that is really good for our business .
 You said in an interview that you were stalking the incredible director Lynne Ramsay . Is it working ? — João Xará , Lisbon , Portugal
 Not yet . I have to amp up my game a little bit more . We had a really nice period where she wa in L.A. writing and not living far from me . We got to hang out a little bit . She ha a little girl and our kid got together . She ’ s an absolutely lovely person and I ’ m such a fan of her work . But she move by the beat of her own drum , and unless she ’ s going to be inspired by something , none of my stuff is flattering enough for her to change her process , which is what I admire most about her .
 How much credit do you give the director for helping your performance shine ? — Screed , New York
 The majority of it . If I felt like I didn ’ t need that or benefit from that , I think I would just be directing my own stuff . There ’ s something really powerful about working with people , whether it ’ s your director or your cinematographer , your entire crew . I often imagine them all sitting at a table , and what they each bring in their own expertise that make what I do so much better .
 Any interest in directing ? — Padgman1 , Downstate Illinois
 I feel like probably , but not right now . I have a passion for storytelling and exploring it in many different facet . I can literally see myself getting into production design . I just love all the tentacle of the process . So yeah , I can see it happening , but there ’ s nothing in the near future that I ’ m imagining .

 BURBANK , Calif. — The Walt Disney Company ha been talking about plan to start a Netflix-style streaming service for two year . On Thursday came the big reveal .
 D-Day , a some in Hollywood called it .
 In a lavish presentation on the Disney lot , Robert A. Iger , Disney ’ s chief executive , offered long-awaited detail about his counterattack on the tech giant that have moved into the entertainment business . The linchpin is Disney Plus , a new subscription video service dedicated to movie and show from Disney , Pixar , the “ Star Wars ” franchise , National Geographic and Marvel .
 Disney Plus will cost $ 7 a month and arrive on Nov. 12 . ( Netflix ’ s cheapest plan is $ 9 , and it standard plan is $ 13 . ) Disney said it intended to roll out the streaming service in Europe and Asia starting next year . It expects subscriber to total 60 million to 90 million by 2024 .
 “ We are all-in , ” Mr. Iger said .
 In it first year , Disney Plus will offer 10 original film and 25 original series , including three “ Avengers ” spinoffs . Disney announced that all 30 season of “ The Simpsons ” would be available on Day One , along with nearly all the “ Star Wars ” movie , the entire Pixar library and family-focused movie and show from it Fox library like “ The Sound of Music ” and “ Malcolm in the Middle . ”
 To market Disney Plus , the company vowed to use the full reach of it empire a it ha never done before , starting with a “ Star Wars ” fan convention in Chicago this weekend . Disney will also mobilize it cruise line , global theme park , retail store , hotel and television network , including ESPN and ABC .
 The presentation , inside Soundstage 2 , home to the original “ Mickey Mouse Club , ” began with a 14-minute sizzle reel highlighting Disney ’ s vast library , which now includes Fox movie like “ Titanic , ” “ Avatar ” and “ Alien. ” Mr. Iger called the library “ a treasure trove of long-lasting , valuable content ” that “ no other content or technology company can rival . ”
 Mr. Iger added , “ It wa important to remind you that we ’ re starting from a position of strength , confidence and unbridled optimism . ”
 The moment amounted to a turning point in the streaming war . For the first time , a traditional medium company demonstrated the firepower needed to compete with Silicon Valley in the fast-growing realm of online video .
 Disney ’ s plan could have failed to impress , along the line of what happened to Apple last month when it staged a similar event focused on it streaming ambition . Apple trotted out celebrity but offered few specific — nothing on pricing , no launch date , barely any footage .
 Disney ha a mixed track record with technology , struggling to find a winning strategy with video game and failing to capitalize on tech-related acquisition like Maker , a YouTube-based video supplier .
 Unlike Apple , Disney unveiled footage from original show and film that are headed to Disney Plus . One live-action series is called “ The Mandalorian. ” Set in the “ Star Wars ” universe and created by Jon Favreau , the show cost an estimated $ 100 million for 10 episode , on a par with earlier season of HBO ’ s extravagant “ Game of Thrones . ”
 Disney also demonstrated the Disney Plus app . The simple user interface , with movie and television tile arranged against a dark background , will look familiar to any Netflix , Amazon or Hulu user . There will be “ recommended for you ” row of suggested show and movie , a well a the option to “ continue watching ” program .
 There will be tile dedicated to the Disney brand , including Pixar , ‘ Star Wars ’ and National Geographic . Each time a user hovers over a brand tile , an animated image is set off — firework blasting behind the Magic Kingdom for the Disney tile or a comic book flip for Marvel .
 Users can make a personalized avatar using character from Disney ’ s intellectual property , including Buzz Lightyear and Moana .
 While the three-and-a-half-hour presentation ’ s target audience wa Wall Street — analyst were invited to attend — the presentation wa also aimed at potential Disney Plus subscriber . Disney also discussed it broader streaming business , which includes Hulu , ESPN Plus and Hotstar , which ha 300 million monthly active user in India .
 Disney will “ likely ” bundle it disparate service at a discounted price , according to Kevin Mayer , chairman of the company ’ s Direct-to-Consumer and International division . Mr. Mayer said that Disney wa “ actively evaluating ” international strategy for Hulu , which currently operates exclusively in the United States . ( Unlike Netflix . )
 Will Disney greatly expand Hulu ’ s budget ? Randy Freer , the chief executive of Hulu , said it planned to expand original program but did not say by how much .
 With Disney ’ s acquisition of much of 21st Century Fox , it now owns 60 percent of Hulu , giving the service a majority owner for the first time in it history . ( The other company with ownership stake include Comcast , at 30 percent , and AT & T ’ s Warner Media . ) Hulu now ha 25 million subscriber . Disney said it expected Hulu ’ s subscriber number to reach 40 million to 60 million in five year , and to be profitable by 2023 or 2024 .
 Most analyst have sky-high expectation for Disney Plus , which the company style a Disney+ .
 “ Our confidence in the resilient success of Disney+ come from the company ’ s unmatched brand recognition , extensive premium content and unparalleled ecosystem to market the service , ” Alexia Quadrani , an analyst at J.P. Morgan , wrote in a recent report . Bank of Montreal and Cowen and Company both upgraded Disney ’ s stock ahead of Thursday ’ s presentation .
 Mr. Iger ha spent year laying the groundwork for Disney Plus . In 2015 , a Netflix grew at a blistering rate , Disney began experimenting overseas with an app called DisneyLife . Rolled out in Britain , DisneyLife offered old movie and television series , child ’ s e-books , game and music . Without new movie , or at least exclusive content , interest wa limited .
 In 2016 Mr. Iger started talking more openly about needing to develop a streaming business — a risky proposition for a company with vast traditional television holding . Disney paid $ 1 billion for a 33 percent stake in BamTech , a streaming service company , eventually paying $ 1.58 billion more for majority control .
 Mr. Iger announced in summer 2017 that Disney would introduce it own Netflix-style service and stop selling movie rerun right to Netflix , forgoing hundred of million of dollar in revenue . In 2018 came Disney ’ s $ 71.3 billion purchase of 21st Century Fox asset , including National Geographic and the Fox movie studio . Mr. Iger positioned the acquisition a supercharging Disney ’ s move into streaming .
 Michael Nathanson , a medium analyst at MoffettNathanson , estimated in a report on Tuesday that Disney Plus could lose a much a $ 1.8 billion annually through 2023 , with programming a one major expense . Add in loss from Hulu and ESPN Plus and Mr. Nathanson expects Disney ’ s streaming division to lose roughly $ 3.8 billion this year and next .
 At least nine new movie are in production or advanced development for Disney Plus , with budget ranging from $ 20 million to $ 60 million . Disney is remaking two musical from it animation library a live-action film : “ Lady and the Tramp ” ( 1955 ) and “ The Sword in the Stone ” ( 1963 ) . Other new movie include “ Togo , ” a period adventure about a sled dog ; “ Noelle , ” starring Anna Kendrick a Santa ’ s daughter ; and an animated “ Phineas and Ferb ” movie .
 Marvel Studios is working on three Disney Plus show . One will focus on Loki from the “ Avengers ” movie , with Tom Hiddleston reprising the role . Another “ Avengers ” star , Elizabeth Olsen , will reprise her Scarlet Witch character in a second series . A third show will be associated with “ Captain America : The Winter Soldier , ” with Anthony Mackie returning a the Falcon .
 Also in the work are episodic spinoffs of Disney franchise like “ High School Musical ” and “ Monsters , Inc. ” Additionally , Disney is working on 10 unscripted show , including a Disney-themed cooking competition , “ Be Our Chef , ” and a series called “ Encore ! ” that reunites the cast of high school musical long after graduation and asks them to recreate their performance .
 Roughly 500 film from Disney ’ s library , including new movie like “ Captain Marvel , ” and 7,500 episode of old Disney-branded television show like “ Hannah Montana ” will anchor Disney Plus .

 SAN FRANCISCO — Disney raised the curtain on a hotly anticipated video steaming service that 's aiming to topple industry pioneer Netflix , once a valuable ally of the Magic Kingdom .
 The service , called Disney Plus , ha been in the work for more than year , but Thursday marked the first time that the longtime entertainment powerhouse ha laid out plan for it attack on Netflix and a formidable cast of competitor , including Amazon , HBO Go and Showtime Anytime .
 Disney Plus will roll out in the U.S. on November 12 at a price of $ 6.99 per month , or $ 69.99 per year . That 's well below the $ 13 monthly fee Netflix charge for it most popular streaming plan , signaling Disney 's determination to woo subscriber a it vies to become a major player in a field that ha turned `` binge watching '' into a common ritual .
 Like Netflix , Disney Plus will be free of ad . Subscribers will be able to download all of the show and movie on Disney 's service to watch offline .
 Netflix will still have a far deeper video programming lineup after spending ten of billion of dollar during the past six year on original show such a `` House of Cards , '' `` Stranger Things '' and `` The Crown . ''
 But Disney Plus will be able to draw upon a library of revered film dating back several decade while it also forge into original programming . Its animated classic , including `` Aladdin '' and `` The Jungle Book '' will be available on the service when it launch .
 New show already on tap include `` The Mandalorian , '' the first live action `` Star Wars '' series , created by Jon Favreau ; a prequel to the `` Star Wars '' film `` Rogue One , '' starring Diego Luna ; a series about the Marvel character Loki , starring Tom Hiddleston ; a rebooted `` High School Musical '' series ; and a new documentary series focused on Disney .
 Disney is approaching the streaming industry from a `` position of strength , confidence and unbridled optimism , '' CEO Bob Iger said Thursday . Iger ha led the company since 2005 and expects to step down when his contract end in 2021 .
 The service 's entire lineup will cover five category : Disney , Pixar , Marvel , Star Wars and National Geographic .
 Although Disney ha an enviable track record of producing show and film that attract huge audience , it attempt to build it own Netflix is risky . To make the leap , Disney ended a lucrative licensing relationship with Netflix , which had become the video streaming home for it latest film after their theatrical release , a well a many of it TV series and classic movie .
 But now movie that came out in 2019 , and going forward , will be streamed only on Disney Plus . That includes `` Captain Marvel , '' which came out earlier this year ; `` Avengers : Endgame , '' which debut in late April ; and the upcoming `` Toy Story 4 , '' live-action movie `` The Lion King '' and `` Aladdin ; '' and `` Star Wars Episode IX . ''
 In many way , it 's hard to compare Netflix with Disney because of the widely different type of show each offer , said eMarketer analyst Paul Verna .
 `` The interesting thing is both company have ended up in the same place , but they 've come to it from vastly different background , '' he said .
 Disney will also contend with a new streaming service from Apple , which is expected to be released in the fall . Apple ha not yet said how much it service will cost or when exactly it will launch .
 Last month , Disney completed it biggest deal yet with it $ 71 billion acquisition of Fox 's entertainment business . The first 30 season of `` The Simpsons '' will now stream exclusively on Disney Plus .
 The Fox takeover help Disney tighten it control over TV show and movie from start to finish — from creating the program to distributing them though television channel , movie theater , streaming service and other avenue . Disney will also get valuable data on customer and their entertainment-viewing habit , which it can then use to sell advertising .
 The Fox deal also gave Disney a controlling stake in Hulu . Iger ha said Hulu will continue to offer general entertainment programming while Disney Plus will be focused on family fare .
 Along with it strong brand , Disney ha the advantage of having a clear strategy for each of it streaming service , Verna said , including Disney Plus , Hulu and ESPN Plus . Disney executive hinted the company would `` likely '' bundle the three at a discounted price , but declined to give more detail .
 Terminating it deal with Netflix will cost Disney about $ 150 million in licensing revenue alone during it current fiscal year ending in September .
 Disney is betting it new service will quickly offset that . By dangling a mix of familiar franchise and beloved animated classic , along with original programming , it figure the new service will be irresistible to family , even if they already subscribe to other service . It expects Disney Plus to be profitable during it 2024 fiscal year .
 The plunge into video streaming is likely to confront Disney with new challenge . One of the biggest dilemma will center on how long Disney wait after a new film 's theatrical release to make it available on it new streaming service .
 Disney said movie would become available on it streaming service only after the traditional theatrical release period and home movie debut , which includes DVDs and purchasing streaming video . That put it schedule behind that of some competitor . Netflix film such a the award-winning `` Roma '' and `` The Ballad of Buster Scruggs '' have either become available for streaming on the same day or just a few day after their short run in theater .
 With nearly 140 million worldwide subscriber , Netflix already ha proven it mettle while warding off one competitive threat after another in the 12 year since it pivoted from DVD-by-mail rental to video streaming .
 Now , Netflix is locking horn with a company that ha been steadily expanding upon it Disney franchise during a shopping spree that ha seen it snap up other major studio .

 The wait wa long . More than three decade , in fact .
 But on Sunday night , two African-American woman won Oscars in nonacting category : Hannah Beachler for production design and Ruth E. Carter for costume design , both for their work on “ Black Panther. ” They became the first African-American woman to win Oscars in their category , and the first to win in a nonacting category since Irene Cara in 1984 , who won for best original song , “ Flashdance ... What A Feeling , ” which she co-wrote .
 [ Read our analysis of the Oscars ceremony , and see the best look from the red carpet . ]
 And Sunday night ’ s win were perhaps appropriate given that the film they won for wa a barrier-breaking spectacle and a box office smash . While there ha been more progress in the high-profile Oscar category in recognizing people of color , that advancement ha historically been limited to onscreen work .
 Beachler and Carter were instrumental in bringing to life the lush Wakanda , the fictional African country where most of “ Black Panther ” take place . Carter , whose career stretch three decade , went to great length , like using a 3-D printer , to authentically create costume influenced by indigenous people across the African continent . Beachler ’ s mapping of Wakanda wa essential in helping Carter execute that vision .
 “ This ha been a long time coming , ” Carter said in her acceptance speech . She had been nominated twice before : “ Amistad ” ( 1997 ) and “ Malcolm X ” ( 1992 ) . ( “ Malcolm X ” wa directed by Spike Lee , who wa up for multiple Oscars of his own on Sunday . )
 [ Here ’ s the full list of Oscar winner . ]
 “ Marvel may have created the first black superhero , but through costume design , we turned him into an African king , ” Carter added . “ It ’ s been my life ’ s honor to create costume . Thank you to the academy . Thank you for honoring African royalty and the empowered way woman can look and lead onscreen . ”
 In Beachler ’ s acceptance speech , she paid tribute to the director of “ Black Panther , ” Ryan Coogler , along with Marvel , and Rachel Morrison , the film ’ s cinematographer , who last year became the first woman nominated for an Oscar in the cinematography category .
 “ I give the strength to all of those who come next , to keep going , to never give up , ” Beachler said through tear . “ And when you think it ’ s impossible , just remember to say this piece of advice I got from a very wise woman : I did my best , and my best is good enough . ”

 Straw police , hamburger paranoia and the state of the right .
 By Paul Krugman
 Opinion Columnist
 Today ’ s column is about plastic straw , hamburger and dishwashing detergent . Also Captain Marvel .
 No , I haven ’ t lost my mind , or at least I don ’ t think so . But quite a few other people have — and their rage-filled pettiness is a more important force in modern America than we like to think .
 My starting point is a weekend tweet from Representative Devin Nunes of California , who headed the House Intelligence Committee until the House changed hand after the midterm . In that role , he basically acted a Donald Trump ’ s stonewaller in chief , doing everything he could to prevent any real investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Vladimir Putin .
 But his tweet wasn ’ t about that . It wa about a waitress who , citing the “ straw police , ” asked his dining party if they wanted straw . “ Welcome to Socialism in California ! ” Nunes thundered .
 If this seems like a weird aberration — he wasn ’ t even denied a straw , just asked if he wanted one — you need to realize that rage explosion over seemingly silly thing are extremely common on the right . By all account , the biggest applause line at the Conservative Political Action Conference — eliciting chant of “ U-S-A , U-S-A ! ” — wa the claim that Democrats are coming for your hamburger , just like Stalin . ( They aren ’ t , and for the record , Stalin wa a mass murderer , but objectively pro-burger . )
 [ Paul Krugman did explanatory journalism before it wa cool , moving from a career a a world-class economist to writing hard-hitting opinion column . For an even deeper look at what ’ s on his mind , sign up for his weekly newsletter . ]
 By the way , this isn ’ t a new phenomenon . I ’ m sure reader can come up with many example , but I happen to remember a 2009 blog post by the right-wing activist Erick Erickson that wa practically an incitement to violence : “ At what point do the people tell the politician to go to hell ? At what point do they get off the couch , march down to their state legislator ’ s house , pull him outside , and beat him to a bloody pulp ? ”
 And what wa the source of his rage ? The observation that dishwasher detergent doesn ’ t work quite a well without the phosphate .
 What do these thing have in common ? All of them involve case where individual choice impose cost on other people . Plastic straw really are a source of ocean pollution . While nobody is planning to ban beef , flatulent cow really are an important source of methane , a powerful greenhouse gas . And phosphate contribute to toxic algae bloom .
 But the rage seems to come from the suggestion that these cost imposed on others mean that white men — it doe seem to always be white men — should consider changing their behavior , even a bit , in the public interest . Which brings me to Captain Marvel .
 For those blissfully unaware of the issue , the latest superhero movie feature a female protagonist , and the actress who play her ha expressed some mildly feminist view . So ?
 Well , for a significant number of men all of this is apparently extremely threatening . Mobs swamped internet site like rottentomatoes.com with negative review before the movie opened , i.e. , before they could even have seen it ; YouTube filled up with attack video and prediction that the film would be a disastrous failure .
 Marvel rage recognizably drew on the same pathological pettiness a straw rage and hamburger rage . As it happens , the movie appears to be a big hit and is receiving favorable audience score . This show that the men afflicted with this syndrome are a fairly small minority .
 But it ’ s not a minority without influence . Nunes wa , for a time , among the most important politician in Washington . CPAC set the agenda for the party that control the White House and the Senate . The recently revealed radio rant of Fox News ’ s Tucker Carlson could have come straight out of one of those bizarre anti-Brie Larson screed .
 The point is that demented anger is a significant factor in modern American political life — and overwhelmingly on one side . All that talk about liberal “ snowflake ” is projection ; if you really want to see people driven wild by tiny perceived slight and insult , you ’ ll generally find them on the right . Nor is it just about racism and misogyny . Although these are big component of the phenomenon , I don ’ t see the obvious connection to hamburger paranoia .
 Just to be clear : To paraphrase John Stuart Mill , I ’ m not saying that most conservative are filled with rage over petty thing . What I ’ m saying instead is that most of those filled with such rage are conservative , and they supply much of the movement ’ s energy . Not to put too fine a point on it , pathological pettiness almost surely put Donald Trump over the top in the 2016 election .
 At this point you probably want to know what I think we should do about it . The truth is that I don ’ t know . I guess there ’ s some case for using tax rather than regulation to control pollution , since you won ’ t be telling people directly what to do . But one suspect that the people I ’ m talking about will still find something to be hysterical about .
 At the very least , however , we should realize what ’ s happening . It may be comforting to believe that politics is driven by more or le rational consideration of cost and benefit . But the reality is that a lot of it is driven by unreasoning rage .
 The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letter to the editor . We ’ d like to hear what you think about this or any of our article . Here are some tip . And here ’ s our email : letter @ nytimes.com .

 On Wednesday , Kevin Hart definitively ruled out hosting the Oscars on “ Good Morning America , ” even though he had been prodded to reconsider during an interview with Ellen DeGeneres .
 So who is going to host the 2019 Academy Awards ? Is anyone ?
 It ’ s unclear . The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ha said nothing publicly about it and did not respond to a request for comment .
 What do we know ?
 The Oscars are slated to be broadcast on Feb. 24 on ABC , a little over six week away . If there is to be a host , unless it ’ s a last-second reveal , one would have to be announced soon to get ready for the broadcast . The lack of preparation time is one reason Hart gave for not reconsidering the job .
 It should be noted : Robert Iger , chief executive of Disney , which owns ABC , told Variety on the Golden Globes red carpet that he wa “ open-minded ” about Hart coming back a host if Hart apologized for past Twitter post and a joke that were deemed homophobic .
 What have we heard ?
 On Wednesday , Variety , citing anonymous source , reported that the academy wa planning to broadcast the ceremony without a host at all . Instead , a roster of top Hollywood star would rotate through and introduce category . The report suggested that the academy would do away with the traditional opening monologue .
 If true , it would be the first time in three decade that the Oscars would proceed without a host . The last time there wa no emcee , in 1989 , Rob Lowe made , um , history for his duet with Snow White .
 Perhaps fearing that Thanos would make half the Oscar rating disappear , the creative team behind the Oscars is also reportedly trying to reunite a much of the cast of Marvel ’ s “ Avengers ” franchise a possible to play a role on the telecast , according to another anonymously sourced report , this one from The Hollywood Reporter . That article also said that cast member of the Marvel juggernaut were asked not to be presenter at the Golden Globes , to ensure that their appearance at the Oscars would be more superpowerful , er , powerful .
 And just to map out all the way corporate synergy play a part here : The final “ Avengers ” movie — “ Avengers : Endgame ” — is due April 26 , and this would undoubtedly help the movie ’ s marketing . Marvel is owned by Disney , and Disney owns ABC , which is broadcasting the ceremony .
 If Hart hosted , what would it have looked like ?
 We got a small preview of what a Hart-led Oscars would look like on Wednesday , when he appeared on “ The Late Show With Stephen Colbert . ”
 “ I wa going to be good . I had some stuff . I had some heat , ” Hart told Colbert .
 Some of the joke were about meme . Hart said he wanted to break the tension since “ they ’ re not there to laugh , because everybody ’ s waiting for their moment. ” He would tell everyone to relax and not become a meme . Colbert then proceeded to share some of Hart ’ s example of previous awards-show meme , like one of Nicole Kidman being caught midclap ( Hart referred to her “ boomerang ” hand ) , and another one of Meryl Streep yelling from the audience .
 “ The whole intent behind them would be , you don ’ t want to be that , so relax , loosen up and have a good time , ” Hart said . “ Then I wa going to go into a bunch of crazy bit . It wa going to be fire , ” Hart said .
 When Colbert asked Hart who he thought should host , Hart said , “ Whoever is wanting and willing of the job . ”

 Having wrapped up their reviewing duty for 2018 , our chief film critic , Manohla Dargis and A. O. Scott , look back at a year of rage , silliness and sublimity at the movie and ahead to the 91st Academy Awards .
 A. O. SCOTT If I had to pick one movie moment to sum up 2018 , it would probably be the last scene of “ Support the Girls , ” Andrew Bujalski ’ s workplace comedy about the manager of a Hooters-like bar and grill in Texas . Not enough people paid attention when the film wa released in August , but Regina Hall ’ s performance ha picked up some award and nomination since then , and everyone should stream it right now .
 Anyway : The movie end with three woman — Hall , Haley Lu Richardson and Shayna McHayle — screaming on a roof . Not in terror ( a woman onscreen so often do ) , but in rage , frustration and a kind of righteous , rebellious glee . They are venting and protesting , having endured an endless cycle of everyday racism , sexism and exploitation . As an ending , it feel triumphant and bleak at the same time , which may be why I keep coming back to it .
 MANOHLA DARGIS I wa up on that roof , at least in spirit . In some way , this sisterly scream is the signature image for the past year . Scarcely a week ( a day ! ) went by without a powerful man being called out for his alleged sexual misconduct , most publicly of course during the fraught Brett Kavanaugh nomination hearing . At the same time that we were witnessing this profound reckoning , we were also seeing a number of female-driven movie , most of which — it ’ s important to recognize — had finished shooting before news of the sexual harassment accusation against Harvey Weinstein broke in October 2017 .
 Oddly , when I watched the roof interlude in “ Support the Girls ” I flashed on the scene in Bernardo Bertolucci ’ s “ Last Tango in Paris ” of Marlon Brando screaming — he ’ s cursing God — under a thundering overhead train . Bertolucci died in November , and his artistic legacy is forever linked , and rightly so , to allegation of abuse from that film ’ s co-star , Maria Schneider . In 2007 , she said that while shooting it most infamous sex scene she felt humiliated and “ a little raped , both by Marlon and by Bertolucci. ” The allegation feel emblematic of the destructive power imbalance in an industry that ha marginalized and victimized woman while giving free license to male abuse .
 No wonder woman are yelling .
 SCOTT A few year ago you and I examined the state of female representation in movie , and found that it wa improving , meaning that a wider range of role seemed to be opening up . But in retrospect a lot of those role — the variety of strong , raunchy and badass comic and action heroine who emerged in the early and middle part of this decade — look like they were designed to deflect criticism or prove a narrow point : that girl could be just a tough , violent , brave or naughty a boy . This boldness wa accompanied by a certain anxiety about losing the male audience , anticipating the tantrum that would later be thrown by some fragile “ Ghostbusters ” and “ Star Wars ” fan .

 In some way , thing haven ’ t changed so much . In a recent essay in Buzzfeed , Alison Willmore note that “ 2018 ha been a rich with slogany , simplified woman ’ s empowerment callouts a it ha been with reason for woman to be filled with rage and dread. ” She single out “ On the Basis of Sex , ” Mimi Leder ’ s film about Ruth Bader Ginsburg ’ s early career , and “ Ocean ’ s 8 , ” Gary Ross ’ s # squadgoals heist picture with a cast including Sandra Bullock , Cate Blanchett , Mindy Kaling and Rihanna .
 But the careful , superficial conventionality of those movie highlight the complexity of so many others . It ’ s worth listing some of them , just a a reminder of how much feminist argument there ha been in and about movie this year — how central the question of woman ’ s anger , power and autonomy have been in popular culture and politics more generally . In no particular order , and in addition to the one we ’ ve already named , I would mention “ Revenge , ” “ Widows , ” “ The Favourite , ” “ The Wife , ” “ Suspiria , ” “ Destroyer , ” “ Can You Ever Forgive Me ? ” “ Roma , ” “ Eighth Grade , ” “ A Wrinkle in Time , ” “ Madeline ’ s Madeline , ” “ Let the Sunshine In ” and “ A Simple Favor. ” It ’ s not that all of them offer equally plausible or positive image — they ’ re not all good movie ! — but that filmmaker seem interested in the politics of woman ’ s experience in a way that feel different . One measure of the difference is that for the first time in I don ’ t know how many year the field of potential Oscar best actress nominee look much wider and more interesting than the potential best actor .
 DARGIS It ’ s great to see so many female-driven story , though — a you say — not all are good or feminist . “ Widows ” and “ Ocean ’ s 8 ” put a spurious sisterly spin on old-fashioned American greed . Both would have been better and more honest if their character were just a openly mercenary a any male movie thief and didn ’ t try to soften these woman ’ s crime with tear and rationalization . By contrast , because “ Support the Girls ” lead with the lived-in , different truth of it character , it feminism is organic , not performative or programmatic . “ Roma ” focus on one woman , but , unlike most American movie , also look at that life in the larger world of structural oppression .
 Taken together , all these movie — the good , the bad , the blah — are welcome just because they offer an actual range of different female role and diverse idea about woman ’ s place in the world . Some of these idea are stale and the moviemaking is dreary or worse , but I ’ m glad they exist . A movie like “ The Wife , ” for instance , is so devoid of aesthetic interest that the only thing we can discus is how it frame power and gender while letting it title character — who ha been long complicit in her husband ’ s literary fraud and his exploitation of her — off the hook .
 “ The Wife ” is calibrated for maximum audience flattery : viewer are encouraged to nod in recognition at the literary milieu and clap their hand in self-congratulatory glee at the husband ’ s fall . Men , bad ; woman , good — it feminism is irritatingly reductive , but it doe make the movie topical fodder especially in 2018 , a year that ha reminded u that feminism speaks in many different voice . Some of these voice are radical and forward-thinking while others seem discouragingly stuck in the same era a , well , “ Green Book , ” yet another movie that seems mostly interested in making it audience — here , presumptively white — feel good about it own racial sensitivity .
 SCOTT I love that “ The Wife , ” most of which take place in Stockholm during the Nobel Prize ceremony , wa released shortly before the Swedish Academy canceled the literature prize because of a sexual harassment scandal . I hope someone ha optioned that kerfuffle — which is too baroque and weird to summarize — for a movie . Maybe Yorgos Lanthimos , fresh off the power game of “ The Favourite . ”
 Films like “ Sorry to Bother You , ” starring Tessa Thompson and Lakeith Stanfield , had more on their mind than comforting fable of finger-lickin ’ harmony .
 Ah yes , “ Green Book. ” It ’ s sort of mind-boggling that Peter Farrelly ’ s compendium of tone-deaf racial clichés arrived on screen in the same year a “ Sorry to Bother You , ” “ BlacKkKlansman ” and “ If Beale Street Could Talk. ” It seems to come not only from a bygone era but from a whole different cinema planet , one governed by feel-good piety that were dubious here on earth even back in the 1960s . The voting membership of the Academy circa 1987 would have given all the prize to “ Green Book , ” but in 2019 it prospect are decidedly cloudier .
 Not that Boots Riley , Spike Lee and Barry Jenkins represent a unified perspective on black life and American racism , or that they are in perfect political and imaginative harmony with one another . Hardly , and thank goodness . But all of them are interested in offering something other than comforting fable of finger-lickin ’ harmony . And even though “ Beale Street ” and “ BlacKkKlansman ” are set in the ‘ 70 , while “ Sorry ” unfolds in a speculative near-future , each one explicitly address the unfinished business of the present .
 Which is what I want : movie that , rather than arriving at pat or reassuring conclusion , embrace the complication of reality and invite the audience to really think about it . Mostly this year I found that in documentary and in other movie made at some distance from the American commercial mainstream .
 DARGIS At this point it feel a if the remaining big studio have nothing to offer other than recycled idea and brand , with some exception . I like some of the box office behemoth — mostly , I like “ Black Panther ” — but too many of them were numbingly familiar in every way , narratively , tonally , whatever . This isn ’ t new or news , but it ’ s bleak that “ Avengers : Infinity War ” receives attention simply because it is from Marvel . Each of it movie is just a delivery system for that brand , though this one did encourage me with the promise that it character and this franchise are finally goner .
 Disney ha been the dominant player for a while and , a it power ha grown , each of it new movie feel like a product launch : The release of the new Marvel , Star Wars or Pixar movie is greeted like the release of the latest iPhone , including the rabid-dog medium attention it generates . There are modification , some nifty new feature , but it ’ s mostly the same , just pricier . This seems like how thing worked in classic Hollywood cinema , which depended on both standardization ( through product quality control and storytelling norm , for instance ) and differentiation ( in the diversity of film and star and so on ) .
 The current big-studio model , though , is more focused on sameness than difference . Each new addition to the franchise can ’ t be meaningfully different enough to mess with the brand . That ’ s partly what make “ Black Panther ” interesting : It doesn ’ t just swap out one Chris for another ( Chris Hemsworth ’ s Thor instead of Chris Evans ’ s Captain America ) . It introduces idea and character that are so strong , so in excess of what we normally see — African-American identity , Afro-futurism , Michael B. Jordan ’ s performance and the very figure of Killmonger — that they become bigger and more important than the Marvel brand and story beat .
 SCOTT It turn out that when “ diversity ” mean something more than pandering or tokenism — when , a in the case of “ Black Panther , ” an African-American filmmaker can claim the freedom to explore the cultural and political valence of an African superhero — a worked-over franchise can be revivified . That ’ s what Ryan Coogler did to the Marvel Universe . ( He ’ d already done it to the “ Rocky ” cosmos with “ Creed , ” which he bequeathed to his fellow U.S.C . alum Steven Caple , Jr . )
 Something similar happened , on a more modest scale and with a more playful sensibility , in “ Spider-Man : Into the Spider-Verse , ” which brought an ingenious , unforced pluralism to the Peter Parker mythos . What if the radioactive spider happened to bite the Afro-Latino son of a police officer and a health care worker ? It ’ s a fascinating question if the answer is handled with appropriate wit and authenticity , a it wa by the gang at Sony Pictures Animation .
 Marvel Comics ha been exploring these kind of story for a while , steadily eroding the white-male monopoly on superhero status in print . I ’ m glad the movie ’ s incarnation of those story are starting to follow suit ( and not only in the Marvel universe , to be fair ) . My political quarrel with “ Black Panther ” — wait , where are you going ? — ha to do with it commitment to monarchism and to Wakanda ’ s appropriation of Silicon Valley techno-neoliberalism a it guiding ideology . Superheroism remains a profoundly anti-democratic undertaking . I wish the great Senegalese filmmaker ( and novelist , labor organizer and political gadfly ) Ousmane Sembène were still around , so he could take up the next chapter in the franchise . Or maybe Disney would hire Raoul Peck ( “ Lumumba , ” “ I Am Not Your Negro ” ) or Abderrahmane Sissako ( “ Bamako , ” “ Timbuktu ” ) to direct a stand-alone Killmonger adventure , one that rescue that misunderstood villain from the condescension of comic-book history . The next phase of the dialectic is surely the synthesis of Marvel and Marx .
 A fellow can dream , anyway .
 DARGIS Keep dreaming , and I mean that in the nicest way , comrade . That “ Black Panther ” inspires such revery — and indeed wa one of the most exciting , idea-generating movie of the year — is further proof that it difference are profound , even if it is another male-driven heroic tale . It ’ s the kind of big-studio release that make me think that the world of American industrial moviemaking isn ’ t a creative wasteland . Its impact even make me look forward to the next Oscars . ( Not really . )

 By Scott Tobias
 All that glitter is not gold in the Netflix original film “ Unicorn Store , ” a sickly-sweet monument to arrested development , built around a failed artist who never grew past the mythical , magical , one-horned creature that enchanted her a a child .
 She also like sticking Bugles on her fingertip , consulting with a shelf of Care Bears and a color palette that suggests an explosion at the Skittles factory .
 Not that there ’ s anything wrong with that — at least not according to Samantha McIntyre , who wrote the script , and Brie Larson , who directs and star , earnestly championing a dreamer that others might dismiss a childish or ridiculous . In fact , “ Unicorn Store ” becomes an argument for itself : If such a tacky fantasy can get produced , then clearly it ’ s a viable enterprise for grown-ups .
 Although the film predates “ Captain Marvel ” — it debuted at the Toronto Film Festival in 2017 , and it is only now on Netflix — the chemistry between it two star , Larson and Samuel L. Jackson , shrewdly connects the two project .
 Resigned to the cubicle drudgery of a public relation agency , where she serf a a temp , Kit ( Larson ) responds to an invitation to “ The Store , ” a mysterious operation run by a Willy Wonka type ( Jackson ) who offer to sell her “ what she needs. ” Kit asks for a unicorn .
 As Kit design a homemade stable for the animal , “ Unicorn Store ” establishes a crude binary between her rainbow iconoclasm and the assortment of middle-aged stiff who nudge her toward a life of coffee-swilling and temp work . The message here is that there ’ s no one-size-fits-all formula for adulthood , but the film doesn ’ t bear it out .

 LOS ANGELES — Disney is taking back James Gunn , the creative force behind it “ Guardians of the Galaxy ” movie franchise , reversing it contentious decision in July to fire the filmmaker for offensive joke he wrote on Twitter several year ago .
 The tweet by Mr. Gunn , who wrote and directed the Marvel superhero film “ Guardians of the Galaxy ” in 2014 and delivered a smash sequel in 2017 , contained joke about pedophilia , AIDS , rape and the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attack . Two far-right provocateur , Mike Cernovich and Jack Posobiec , threw a spotlight on the comment — written between 2009 and 2012 — after Mr. Gunn harshly criticized President Trump online .
 Disney executive seemed to acknowledge on Friday that they made a misstep of their own in almost immediately firing Mr. Gunn in the aftermath : At the time , “ Guardians ” cast member condemned the decision a an overreaction to the “ mob mentality ” of the internet . If nothing else , the reversal reflects the challenge that Hollywood studio face a they contend with online furor over past behavior in response to the # MeToo and Time ’ s Up movement , all while trying to protect billion-dollar film property .
 Walt Disney Studios revealed Mr. Gunn ’ s reinstatement a the director of “ Guardians of the Galaxy 3 ” in an article on Deadline.com , a trade news site . Disney declined to comment further , except to confirm the report ’ s accuracy . In a statement on Twitter , Mr. Gunn called himself “ incredibly humbled ” and “ tremendously grateful ” to those who had supported him in recent month .
 “ I am always learning and will continue to work at being the best human being I can be , ” he wrote . “ I deeply appreciate Disney ’ s decision . ”
 Alan F. Horn , chairman of Walt Disney Studios , decided to rehire Mr. Gunn — several month ago — after a series of meeting with the director . Mr. Horn , who reached out to Mr. Gunn , had been impressed with his public apology on the day Disney fired him . Mr. Gunn repeatedly took responsibility for his word , which he called “ stupid , not at all funny , wildly insensitive and certainly not provocative like I had hoped . ”
 “ Regardless of how much time ha passed , ” he had added , “ I understand and accept the business decision taken today . ”
 Mr. Gunn ’ s response stood in contrast to how other star have reacted in similar situation . Kevin Hart , for instance , wa initially defensive when his past anti-gay comment on Twitter resurfaced in December after he wa named host of the Academy Awards telecast . Mr. Hart did not apologize at first , instead posting a video online in which he said : “ Guys , I ’ m almost 40 year old . If you don ’ t believe that people change , grow , evolve a they get older , I don ’ t know what to tell you . ”
 Six hour later , he stepped down a Oscar host and offered a perfunctory apology .
 It wa unclear to what degree Disney wa influenced by blowback from “ Guardians ” fan over Mr. Gunn ’ s ouster . Hundreds of thousand of people signed a Change.org petition asking Disney to reconsider .
 “ Guardians of the Galaxy ” is a crucial property for Disney . The first two movie , starring Chris Pratt a Star-Lord and Zoe Saldana a Gamora , and featuring fan-favorite creature like Groot and Rocket raccoon , collected roughly $ 1.6 billion at the global box office . Disney also sell “ Guardians ” merchandise and is counting on an expensive new “ Guardians ” attraction at Epcot in Florida to sell theme park vacation .
 Fans greeted Mr. Gunn ’ s official return to the Marvel universe with euphoria . Mr. Cernovich , for one , wa not happy . The far-right blogger , author and YouTube personality wrote on Twitter , “ If you think Gunn getting rehired hurt me rather than child , you ’ re a sick person and part of the problem . ”

 ( Reuters ) - Shares of Walt Disney Co touched an all-time high on Friday after Wall Street analyst said the aggressive pricing of it new video streaming service could help it better compete with Netflix Inc .
 Netflix 's share fell about 4 percent after Disney priced it streaming service , Disney+ , at $ 6.99 per month , below the video streaming pioneer 's basic plan of $ 8.99 .
 `` Investors find a lot of promise in Disney 's offering because it 's well positioned to fight the like of Netflix for consumer ' money , '' said Clement Thibault , analyst at global financial market platform Investing.com .
 Shares of Disney jumped 10 percent to $ 128.26 , adding $ 21 billion to the company 's market capitalization of $ 209 billion on Thursday .

 NEW YORK — A rush of newcomer could n't shake `` Shazam ! '' from the top spot , a the superhero comedy led the box office for the second straight weekend with $ 25.1 million in ticket sale , according to studio estimate Sunday .
 Lionsgate 's `` Hellboy '' reboot , the animated Laika Studios release `` Missing Link , '' the college romance `` After '' and even the long-delayed `` Mary Magdalene , '' originally to be released by the Weinstein Co. , all opened in theater . But the strongest new release of them all wa , predictably , the Will Packer-produced one : `` Little . ''
 The body-swap comedy `` Little '' came in second with $ 15.5 million for Universal Pictures . Made for just $ 20 million , `` Little '' is just the most recent profit-maker for Packer , the `` Girls Trip '' producer .
 The film , directed by Tina Gordon Chism , star 14-year-old Marsai Martin a the child an abusive tech executive ( Regina Hall ) reverts to after a magical spell is cast on her . Martin , the `` black-ish '' star , also executive produced the film , the youngest ever so credited in Hollywood history .
 `` Little '' drew a largely female ( 65 and African American ( 43 % ) audience . Jim Orr , Universal Pictures distribution chief , credited the cast , Chism 's direction and Packer 's overall know-how .
 `` He 's done it with different kind of film . 'Breaking In ' wa a thriller , 'Girls Trip ' wa an R-rated comedy . 'Little ' is kind of an all-ages film , PG-13 rated , ' '' said Orr , whose studio signed a first-look deal with Packer in 2013 . `` He 's a brand . And he ha a great idea of what is going to be successful at the box office . ''
 It wa an out-of-body weekend at the box office . The body-swap comic-book adaptation `` Shazam ! '' — about a teenage boy ( Asher Angel ) who can turn into an adult-sized superhero ( Zachary Levi ) with a simple command — held solidly in it second week . Capitalizing on good review and word-of-mouth , `` Shazam ! '' is Warner Bros. ' New Line 's latest DC Comics success . It ha grossed $ 94.9 million through Sunday with a worldwide total of $ 258.8 million .
 Lionsgate and Millennium 's `` Hellboy '' had been expected by many to vie with `` Shazam ! '' on the weekend . But on the heel of terrible review ( just 15 % `` fresh '' on Rotten Tomatoes ) , it flopped with $ 12 million against a $ 50 million budget .
 That 's significantly le than the debut of the 2004 original ( $ 23 million opening ) and the 2008 sequel ( $ 34.5 million opening ) . Those film were directed by Guillermo de Toro and starred Ron Perlman ; the new `` Hellboy '' star David Harbour ( `` Stranger Things '' ) and is directed by Neil Marshall .
 `` Missing Link '' also missed . It opened with a disappointing $ 5.8 million , marking a new low for Laika , the maker of eccentric animated tale such a `` Coraline , '' `` ParaNorman '' and `` Kubo and the Two Strings . '' ''Missing Link , '' distributed by United Artists Releasing , is about the discovery of a creature in the Pacific Northwest . Its voice cast includes Zach Galifianakis , Hugh Jackman and Zoe Saldana .
 Expectations had varied widely for Aviron Pictures ' `` After , '' an adaption of Anna Todd 's 2014 best-seller . The young-adult drama fared well with $ 6.2 million in 2,138 theatre .
 And `` Mary Magdalene , '' starring Rooney Mara a Mary and Joaquin Phoenix a Jesus , finally opened , more than three year after production . Harvey Weinstein had once conceived of the film , directed by Garth Davis ( `` Lion '' ) a his next Oscar contender .
 After the fallout of Weinstein and the bankruptcy of the Weinstein Co. , IFC Films acquired the biblical biopic . Critics dismissed it ( 44 % fresh on Rotten Tomatoes ) and audience mostly did , too . It grossed about $ 62,000 on 62 screen .
 Estimated ticket sale for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theater , according to Comscore . Where available , the latest international number for Friday through Sunday are also included .
 1 . `` Shazam ! '' $ 25.1 million ( $ 35.9 million international ) .
 2 . `` Little , '' $ 15.5 million ( $ 1.9 million international ) .

 BURBANK , Calif. — Walt Disney Co priced it highly anticipated streaming video service below Netflix in an aggressive move to challenge the dominant streaming service and entice family to buy yet another monthly subscription .
 Disney said on Thursday it new family-friendly streaming service will cost $ 7 monthly or $ 70 annually with a slate of new and classic TV show and movie from some of the world 's most popular entertainment franchise in a bid to challenge the digital dominance of Netflix .
 The ad-free monthly subscription called Disney+ is set to launch on Nov. 12 and in every major global market over time , the company said . In addition to Disney film and TV show , it will feature programming from the Marvel superhero universe , the `` Star Wars '' galaxy , `` Toy Story '' creator Pixar animation the National Geographic channel and the entire library of `` The Simpsons . ''
 `` What we are putting forward is an aggressive strategy , '' Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger told analyst at the presentation . `` We 've got to be very serious and all in on it . ''
 The company set a target of luring between 60 million to 90 million subscriber and achieving profitability in fiscal year 2024 . It plan to plow a little over $ 1 billion in cash to finance original programming in fiscal 2020 and about $ 2 billion by 2024 .
 The cost of the service wa lower than the $ 7.50 per month that Wall Street analyst expected on average , according to a Reuters poll , and could likely be seen a a stronger bid to appeal to more customer .
 Patrice Cucinello , a director at Fitch Ratings , said Disney had priced the new service `` very affordably . ''
 `` Disney is approaching streaming offering , particularly Disney+ , with gun blazing , looking to take share and quickly ramp subscriber growth , '' Cucinello said .

 BURBANK , Calif. — Walt Disney Co priced it highly anticipated streaming video service below Netflix in an aggressive move to challenge the dominant streaming service and entice family to buy yet another monthly subscription .
 Disney said on Thursday it new family-friendly streaming service will cost $ 7 monthly or $ 70 annually with a slate of new and classic TV show and movie from some of the world 's most popular entertainment franchise in a bid to challenge the digital dominance of Netflix .
 The ad-free monthly subscription called Disney+ is set to launch on Nov. 12 and in every major global market over time , the company said . In addition to Disney film and TV show , it will feature programming from the Marvel superhero universe , the `` Star Wars '' galaxy , `` Toy Story '' creator Pixar animation the National Geographic channel and the entire library of `` The Simpsons .

 The company set a target of luring between 60 million to 90 million subscriber and achieving profitability in fiscal year 2024 . It plan to plow a little over $ 1 billion in cash to finance original programming in fiscal 2020 and about $ 2 billion by 2024 .
 The cost of the service wa lower than the $ 7.50 per month that Wall Street analyst expected on average , according to a Reuters poll , and could likely be seen a a stronger bid to appeal to more customer .
 Patrice Cucinello , a director at Fitch Ratings , said Disney had priced the new service `` very affordably . ''
 `` Disney is approaching streaming offering , particularly Disney+ , with gun blazing , looking to take share and quickly ramp subscriber growth , '' Cucinello said .
 To get it in front of more people , Disney said it ha struck deal with Roku Inc and Sony Corp to distribute Disney+ on streaming device and console gaming system and expects it to be widely available on smart television , tablet , and other outlet by launch .

 NEW YORK — The Notre-Dame de Paris , which sustained a devastating fire Monday , ha inspired writer , painter and filmmaker for hundred of year . Here are some notable example :
 PAINTING : Henri Matisse painted it often— in intimate blue , a distant green , a pinkish haze . It served a a melancholy backdrop for William-Adolphe Bouguereau 's `` The Bohemian , '' while the interior provided a golden , grandiose aura for Jacques-Louis David 's `` The Coronation of Napoleon . ''
 BOOKS : Think of book about Notre Dame and you 'll inevitably begin with Victor Hugo 's `` Notre-Dame of Paris '' ( otherwise known a `` The Hunchback of Notre-Dame '' ) , his 1831 masterpiece . But Notre Dame also appears in work ranging from Balzac 's `` The Wrong Side of Paris '' to the `` Babar '' and `` Madeline '' child 's series .
 MOVIES : It 's there , of course , in the adaptation of Hugo 's novel , whether the 1939 version starring Charles Laughton , the 1956 remake with Anthony Quinn or the 1996 Disney musical featuring the voice of Tom Hulce and Demi Moore among others . You 'll spot it , too , in the background a Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn converse in `` Charade , '' and a Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy cruise along the Seine in `` Before Sunset , '' a Hawke marvel at it surviving the Nazi occupation of World War II and Delpy responds , `` But you have to think that Notre Dame will be gone one day . ''
 MUSIC : `` Dark wa the night when our tale wa begun/On the dock near Notre Dame , '' sing David Ogden Stiers , Paul Kandel and Tony Jay in the Disney film , the soundtrack composed by Alan Menken . In ABBA 's `` One Last Summer , '' it 's a sentimental detail ( `` In the tourist jam , round the Notre-Dame/Our last summer/Walking hand in hand '' ) . It 's an object of awe in Garland Jefferies ' `` Jump Jump '' ( `` We pas Notre Dame/So much history/So much bigger than me '' ) and a brooding symbol in Roxy Music 's `` Europe '' ( `` And here by the Seine/Notre Dame casts/A long lonely shadow '' ) .

 LOS ANGELES — What will happen to Sony Pictures ?
 That ha been a question in Hollywood since Kenichiro Yoshida took over a Sony Corporation ’ s chief executive in April . Unlike his two predecessor , Mr. Yoshida , a number-cruncher based in Japan and known for jettisoning underperforming business , seemed to have little affinity for the company ’ s also-ran movie and television division , which is best known a the home of Spider-Man and “ Seinfeld . ”
 Surely this would be the moment for Sony to get rid of the midsize studio — especially since Rupert Murdoch had just decided to sell his bigger 20th Century Fox to Disney , having concluded it did not have the scale needed to compete with moviedom insurgent like Netflix , Apple and Amazon .
 Surprise . When Mr. Yoshida take the stage on Monday at the CES trade show in Las Vegas , he plan to use the high-profile platform to showcase Sony movie , television show and music . He plan to telegraph that not only will his Sony not exit any of these business , it will make them a priority a his predecessor have not . In particular , Mr. Yoshida want to make better use of the company ’ s online PlayStation Network a a way to bring Sony movie , show and music directly to consumer . PlayStation Network , introduced in 2006 , now ha more than 80 million monthly active user .
 “ I want to convey the message that Sony is a creative entertainment company , ” Mr. Yoshida said by phone from Tokyo before leaving for Nevada . That description amount to a significant shift . Sony ha long been seen a a consumer electronics superpower first and a Hollywood entity second .
 He added that Sony ’ s three separately run entertainment business — music , gaming and motion picture — have been told from on high that it is time to collaborate more consistently . In the past , analyst say , PlayStation Network manager have been hesitant to team up with their movie and music counterpart , worrying that the service ’ s core gamers would balk if they felt that Sony wa pushing , say , family film at them .
 Mr. Yoshida seemed le concerned . He called PlayStation Network “ a very strong entertainment platform for all of Sony — very suitable for video and music content . ”
 Mr. Yoshida said he wa asking for collaboration at a time when all the pertinent division have new leader . Tony Vinciquerra became chief executive of Sony Pictures in June 2017 . John Kodera took over gaming slightly more than a year ago . In recent month , Rob Stringer and Jon Platt were named a Sony ’ s top executive in music recording and publishing . All report to Mr. Yoshida ; he said he had no plan to consolidate the entertainment business under a single executive .
 “ Entertainment is in Sony ’ s DNA , ” Mr. Yoshida said . “ We ’ ve now been in the music business for 50 year , the motion picture business for 30 year and the game business for over 25 years. ” For it last fiscal year , the three unit made up 47 percent of Sony ’ s operating profit , which totaled $ 6.7 billion , the highest in the conglomerate ’ s 72-year history .
 Positioning Sony a an entertainment company represents a “ directional change ” and fit with other public comment Mr. Yoshida ha made since he took over nine month ago , said Masaru Sugiyama , a Goldman Sachs analyst . “ It ha felt a if entertainment is more integrated with the rest of Sony within Yoshida-san ’ s mind , ” Mr. Sugiyama said .
 Even so , Sony is in no way leaning away from it portfolio of technology and consumer product .
 At CES , a the Las Vegas trade show is known , Sony is expected to showcase image sensor for car , new audio product , ultra-ultra high-definition television and robotics . Thomas E. Rothman , Sony ’ s movie chief , will take the stage after Mr. Yoshida to talk up the company ’ s turnaround in film , bringing along Phil Lord and Christopher Miller , producer of the studio ’ s recent “ Spider-Man : Into the Spider-Verse. ” But Mr. Rothman ’ s remark will be peppered with reference to how Sony camera have helped the studio — it tech breakthrough bolstering it creative endeavor .
 Sony ’ s entertainment empire ha it share of challenge , of course .
 After buying out partner , Sony ha outright control of the world ’ s largest catalog of music publishing asset . But the recording unit had a soft 2018 in the hit department .
 Apple ha been poaching Sony television and film executive to work on it coming streaming service . And major Sony-made television show like “ Better Call Saul ” and “ The Blacklist ” are aging . Efforts to find replacement have mostly fizzled , in part because the highest-paying TV network are ordering more show from in-house supplier .
 As a whole , however , Sony ’ s entertainment business are stronger than they have been in memory — in particular the film division , which suffered a devastating cyberattack in 2014 . Mr. Rothman and Mr. Vinciquerra have turned movie into an unexpected engine by cutting cost and focusing more intently on all-audience “ tent pole ” fantasy like “ Jumanji : Welcome to the Jungle , ” which took in $ 962 million worldwide in 2017 . To dropped jaw in Hollywood , “ Venom ” generated $ 856 million in ticket sale late last year .
 Sony ha a parade of big-budget sequel on the way — “ Men in Black : International ” arrives in June — and the studio is aggressively mining the right it hold to Marvel character in the Spider-Man comic family . To that end , movie based on Morbius , Black Cat and Silver Sable are in the work ; the Sinister Six could be Sony ’ s answer to “ The Avengers. ” Sony is also considering making animated television show based on character introduced in “ Spider-Man : Into the Spider-Verse , ” which ha collected $ 276 million at the box office .
 Now that Fox ha been sold , only Disney and Sony have right to make Marvel-related film and television content .
 And Marvel character are popular with the PlayStation Network crowd . One reason that Mr. Yoshida is pushing for more collaboration : Marvel ’ s Spider-Man , a $ 60 game , set a record for Sony in September by selling 3.3 million copy in it first three day of release .

 Could we please have a little quiet ? There ’ s a great actress onstage at the Cort Theater , and I ’ d like to hear what she ’ s saying .
 That wa the way I felt during much of Sam Gold ’ s production of “ King Lear , ” which opened on Thursday night with the extraordinary Glenda Jackson in the title role . It should surprise no one that Ms. Jackson is delivering a powerful and deeply perceptive performance a the most royally demented of Shakespeare ’ s monarch .
 But much of what surround her in this glittery , haphazard production seems to be working overtime to divert attention from that performance . That includes a perfectly lovely string quartet — playing original music by Philip Glass , no le — that under other circumstance I would have enjoyed listening to .
 Here , though , this intermittent concert seems to be competing with , rather than underscoring , Shakespeare ’ s bleakest tragedy . The same might be said of Miriam Buether ’ s blindingly gold set ( lighted to sear the eye by Jane Cox ) , which blaze with nouveau riche vulgarity .
 Perhaps we are meant to think of the gilded surface of Trump pleasure dome , though I ’ m not sure that ’ s the intention . To be honest , I ’ m not sure of a lot of the intention behind the choice here .
 That includes those of many of the supporting player , who include the formidable like of Ruth Wilson , Elizabeth Marvel , Jayne Houdyshell and John Douglas Thompson . By and large , the performance seem to have been blown into uneasy coexistence by random wind from different direction .
 Yet there , amid the chaos , is Ms. Jackson , like a sharp and gleaming scythe slashing through an overgrown field . Lear may be one of world literature ’ s most disturbingly lost soul . But Ms. Jackson hews to his tortured path with such insight that we register every twisting contour in a dispossessed monarch ’ s road into madness and redemption . That is , when the view of him isn ’ t obstructed by the garish obstacle course that ha been assembled for him to run .
 This is the role with which Ms. Jackson , a two-time Oscar winner , returned to the stage to hosanna — at London ’ s Old Vic in 2016 — after 23 year a a member of the British Parliament . Continuing what is sure to remain one of the most remarkable second — or is it third ? — act in show business , Ms. Jackson proceeded to Broadway in 2018 to appear not a Lear , but a the aged , bitter , death-denying central figure of Edward Albee ’ s “ Three Tall Women . ”
 She deservedly won the 2018 Tony Award for best actress for that performance . Now , at last , New York ha the chance to see her Lear , albeit in a different production , and it is a carefully faceted jewel .
 The surprise here isn ’ t that a woman is playing a man , which quickly come to seem irrelevant . What ’ s more unexpected is the subtlety with which this natural powerhouse shade her character from the start .
 Unlike most Lears , Ms. Jackson doesn ’ t begin in full , imperious spleen . When we first meet him , he ’ s a tyrant who doesn ’ t have to raise his voice because he assumes his every wish is everybody else ’ s command . Unquestioning obedience from those who orbit him is the central fact of his life .
 When he exile his youngest , best-loved daughter , Cordelia ( a sullen Ms. Wilson ) because she isn ’ t sufficiently effusive in her praise of him , it feel like a petulant , conditioned reflex , the caprice of a moment that he might later reverse .
 Except , of course , he ’ s renounced his power , dividing his kingdom among his sycophantic older daughter , Goneril and Regan ( Elizabeth Marvel and Aisling O ’ Sullivan , whose accent suggest they grew up in very different part of the world ) .
 From that moment , Lear ’ s will is no longer the world ’ s law , a change of circumstance that dumbfounds him . Ms. Jackson turn his fall from power into a carefully graded ascent into self-knowledge . Yes , this king howl and rant and reviles , after being turned out by the daughter he assumed would always worship him .
 But his madness is that of a cosseted egotist who ha experienced an electric shock to his solipsism . Divested of home and “ the large effect that troop with majesty , ” Lear is forced to perceive the loneliness and nakedness of the human lot , and Ms. Jackson make sure that we see him seeing it .
 On that blasted heath , in the fabled storm of the third act ( bizarrely played on the shallow ledge left by the fallen drop curtain ) , what register most poignantly aren ’ t the violent imprecation .
 It ’ s Lear ’ s astonished , self-lacerating recognition of what he call “ unaccommodated man ” a a universal condition . When Lear startlingly see himself in a half-naked beggar ( Sean Carvajal a the disguised Edgar ) on the heath , Ms. Jackson ’ s wondering , wounded expression suggests an epiphany that ’ s both glorious and damning .
 Sad to say , nothing else in this production match her incisiveness .
 Mr. Gold took brazen but rewarding liberty with Shakespeare in his excellent , starry New York production of “ Othello ” ( with Daniel Craig and David Oyelowo , in 2016 ) and “ Hamlet ” ( with Oscar Isaac in 2017 ) .
 Presented in intimate Off Broadway house , these show made the audience feel complicit with performer , who seemed to be excavating their character and unearthing precious discovery a we watched . Mr. Gold ’ s “ Lear ” is filled with gimmicky stage business that hasn ’ t been refined into a more fully integrated point of view .
 Or maybe the problem is that the cast member seem to be moving to different internal music and rhythm , so that no one appears to be in sync with anyone else . Is that Mr. Gold ’ s point ? It seems fitting that in this version , Regan ’ s husband , the Duke of Cornwall ( Russell Harvard ) , is deaf . Is Cornwall ’ s aide ( Michael Arden ) — who conspicuously interprets speech into vigorous sign language — perhaps meant to signify the difficulty of disparate soul communicating ?
 Oh , I don ’ t know . Nor did I really understand why there wa a life-size ceramic pug and lion by Lear ’ s throne . Or why everyone — including Lear ’ s supposedly ill-kempt , rowdy soldier — look like extra from “ Downton Abbey ” in their evening clothes ( the illustrious Ann Roth did the costume ) , forever sipping tea or Champagne , even when the world is falling apart .
 ( I think I do understand why Ms. Wilson ’ s piquant , Cockney-accented Fool , after delivering a poem about the topsy-turviness of an unhinged world , pull up his trouser to reveal American flag sock . But it ’ s a desperate and sour bid for relevance . )
 The cast member at least seem to know what they ’ re saying , although few of them ( the double-cast Ms. Wilson is an exception ) have taken the next step in creating complete portrait . Mr. Thompson ( a the faithful Kent ) and Ms. Houdyshell ( a the doomed , fatuous Gloucester ) and Pedro Pascal ( a the dastardly Edmund ) deliver clear-spoken but oddly unmodulated performance .
 Ms. Marvel at least seems to have a thought-through idea for her Goneril ( a a sexually overcharged society hostess ) . But it ’ s hard to imagine her emerging from the same royal nursery a Ms. O ’ Sullivan ’ s shrill , primal Regan .
 Such disparity mean that the kingdom of Lear becomes a very , very lonely planet , where no one ha anyone to talk to , really . Maybe that ’ s why so many of the performer pitch their monologue directly to the audience , like stand-up comic in search of reassurance .
 That doe not include Ms. Jackson ’ s Lear . Her monologue are delivered defiantly to the heaven , a if she had a direct line to a cruel and almighty God . On the basis of this supremely intelligent performance , I don ’ t doubt that she doe .

 The super bloom in Lake Elsinore , Calif.CreditCreditEmily Berl for The New York Times

 When I first moved to Southern California , I wa struck by the Friday afternoon conversation in which colleague discussed their weekend hiking plan the way New Yorkers would talk about where they might have brunch . Almost everyone hiked , and they were eager to extol the merit of favorite trail .
 I soon came to understand that this reflected something larger : the importance of Californians ’ relationship with the outdoors . The climate wa not a punch line , but a reality that shaped lifestyle . Only after year of reading history did I appreciate the extent to which the natural world ha always been intrinsic to California ’ s identity .
 So the exuberant embrace of this year ’ s “ super bloom , ” an exceptional show of wildflower coloring normally barren hillside and desert valley , make perfect sense . The wildflower hotlines and daily website update , the Instagram selfies in poppy field , the pilgrimage to find the rare ghost flower , represent the latest iteration of tradition that date back to the 19th century , when thousand of hiker took to the Southern California foothill every weekend .
 This super bloom ha offered a particularly welcome respite , a reminder that the increasingly extreme climate condition can produce beauty a well a destruction , wondrous golden field a well a mudslide and wildfire . The condition necessary to transform million of long-dormant seed into an explosion of flower generally occur about once a decade ; they are drought followed by abundant rain , temperature not too hot and not too cold , and an absence of strong wind . Parts of the state had abundant display of wildflower in 2005 , and again in 2017 , after several year of severe drought had cleared out invasive plant that can choke the delicate flower . This year ’ s bloom is more widespread — purple and yellow spray along freeway median , golden poppy covering hillside that glow orange from mile away , and desert valley filled with dozen of specie , some not seen for decade .
 To live in a state that includes three desert and vast city built in semiarid clime , a state where the intransigent politics of water are omnipresent , is to appreciate the wonder of a muddy desert wash and the profusion of color in a what is usually a brown landscape .
 “ A stream ! In the desert ! ” marveled a hiker in Anza-Borrego Desert State Park last week a she observed the rushing water alongside the popular Palm Canyon trail , so treacherous after heavy rain that it wa closed for three week . “ All life in the desert revolves around water , a you will discover along this self-guided trail , ” read the brochure for the Palm Canyon hike . The weekend the trail reopened , the park soon ran out of brochure a thousand trekked through .
 Californians of all age , shape and ethnicity have flocked to Anza-Borrego , in eastern San Diego County , to witness a super bloom of quantity and quality not seen in decade . State police direct traffic , nearby business chipped in for extra trash can and portable toilet , volunteer set up temporary kiosk to hand out bloom map . The largest state park in California , Anza-Borrego includes a big chunk of the Colorado Desert that is home to more than 900 plant specie . Park official expect the average number of annual visitor , 600,000 , to jump by at least 50 percent this year .
 Young people pack up their child and head to the park to wander through field of purple lupine and orange aster , redolent with the sweet scent of sand verbena . Old people pack up their telephoto lens and rise early to beat the crowd , hiking the wash in search of the perfect desert lily and the rare five spot .
 From California ’ s earliest day , hiking , camping and outdoor excursion have been a way of life . In the 1860s , group began to vacation in camp on the Russian River in a tradition they called the “ paseár. ” In 1864 , at the urging of Frederick Law Olmsted , a large swath of the Sierra including Yosemite Valley became essentially the nation ’ s first national park . In 1892 , John Muir founded the Sierra Club to protect the park . In 1903 , Muir camped out for four day with President Theodore Roosevelt in Yosemite , by then officially a national park and a symbol of California .
 Even then , East Coast intellectual quick to dismiss California a a cultural wasteland marveled at it natural beauty . Visiting San Diego in April 1905 , the writer Henry James found the culture nonexistent but the natural world unlike anything he had seen elsewhere .
 Writing his sister-in-law , James put down word that describe what thousand would experience more than a century later : “ The day have been mostly here of heavenly beauty , and the flower , the wildflower just now in particular , which fairly rage , with radiance , over the land , are worthy of some purer planet than this . ”

 Streaming Movie Review

 Mötley Crüe ’ s first gig , a dramatized in Jeff Tremaine ’ s Netflix adaptation of the band ’ s memoir , “ The Dirt , ” doe not go well . The drummer , Tommy Lee , knock over a cymbal before anyone play a note ; the crowd ’ s heckling turn into a full-on brawl . But when that fight is over , a guy in the back puncture the silence to scream , “ [ Expletive ] yeah , Mötley Crüe ! ”
 And that sentiment is an apt summation of the approach and complexity of this tepid , incompetent biopic .
 The book version , attributed to all four member and the writer Neil Strauss , wa a notorious tell-all , reveling in the group ’ s bad behavior and self-mythologizing . But Tremaine and the screenwriter Rich Wilkes and Amanda Adelson have sanded it down to a junior varsity “ Bohemian Rhapsody , ” complete with many of the same crude device : embarrassingly bad wig , hilariously on-the-nose needle drop ( the band play “ Take Me to the Top ” a they go … to the top ) and declamatory , subtext-free dialogue .
 As with “ Bohemian , ” the result is the kind of paint-by-numbers storytelling that “ Walk Hard ” should have smothered in it crib over a decade ago . Tremaine ’ s staging is a convincing a an ’ 80s-themed party at an insurance office , and the film is shot with all the visual punch of a period Bud Light commercial .
 The nonstop preening and partying of the first half is exhausting , but the comedown , in which Tremaine attempt to rearrange the film into a serious character drama , is downright painful . The filmmaker try desperately to have it both way , flipping from cheerful hedonism to “ Reefer Madness ” -style moralizing . The complexity of addiction seems out of their grasp .
 Biopics love to dazzle u with their try-hard verisimilitude , and this one give u nearly 10 minute of end-credit split-screen comparison between the real Crüe and the movie Crüe , presumably so we can marvel at the skill of the duplication . But that ’ s cosplay , not moviemaking . Until then , “ The Dirt ” play like an ill-advised remake of “ This Is Spinal Tap ” — one in which all the laugh are unintentional .

 “ There ’ s not likely to be a more meaningful , absorbing , forceful and radical performance by an American musician this year , or any year soon , ” he wrote . “ It wa rich with history , potently political and visually grand . By turn uproarious , rowdy , and lush . A gobsmacking marvel of choreography and musical direction . ”

 I make mistake sometimes , Jenna .
 jenna wortham
 Shocker .
 wesley morris
 Sometimes I ’ m made aware that important thing are happening , and I just look the other way . [ LAUGHING ] So on September 20th , when I wa made aware of the fact that Michelle Obama wa going to come to New York City a part of this rollout tour , stadium tour , for her new book , Becoming , what did I do ? I went and got a burrito and didn ’ t think anything of it . I forwarded it to you . And you were like , we ’ ve got to go !
 jenna wortham
 And you dropped the ball .
 wesley morris
 We didn ’ t go .
 jenna wortham
 We didn ’ t go .
 wesley morris
 Well , you know who did go .
 jenna wortham
 Who ?
 wesley morris
 You know who snapped up ticket in 10 second for 10 people ?
 jenna wortham
 Ugh .
 wesley morris
 My little sister Robin .
 jenna wortham
 So jealous .
 wesley morris
 So I think we should get her on the phone and find out what we missed . [ LAUGHING ]
 jenna wortham
 Let ’ s get the recap . [ PHONE DIALING ]
 robin
 Hi .
 jenna wortham
 Hi , Robin .
 wesley morris
 Are you pulled over , or are you driving ?
 robin
 I ’ m pulled over now , sir .
 wesley morris
 OK. [ LAUGHING ] Are the window up and everything ?
 robin
 Didn ’ t I just tell you it wa snowing , boy ?
 wesley morris
 Oh , right . Sorry . [ LAUGHING ] Sorry ! I forgot ! I forgot , I forgot , I forgot .
 jenna wortham
 So Robin , I need you to start at the beginning and just tell me everything you remember about the MObama experience .
 robin
 It wa just an awesome experience . When we first heard that she wa coming to town , I contacted a many a my friend and my cousin a I could to see who could go , because it wa on a Thursday night . And I had overwhelming turnout . So getting the tickets— the ticket sold out in five minute . So I got 10 of them . We were on the floor . And when she came up on stage , we started cry . Just the fact that we could see her in person and so up close and personal— it wa just an awesome experience .
 jenna wortham
 Aw . Why do you think you were cry ? What moved you ?
 robin
 Um , she ’ s just a very graceful , empowering woman . And she encourages and empowers not just u woman a African-Americans , but woman across the world .
 jenna wortham
 And what wa Michelle wearing ?
 robin
 Michelle Obama had on this beautiful red suit . And red is my color , you know , because I ’ m a Delta . [ DELTA SOUND OFF ] [ LAUGHING ] But she wa just so graceful and so poised when she came out on stage . And when we saw her , we just— we started cry . It wa just very emotional . It just came over me out of nowhere .
 jenna wortham
 Did you like the book ?
 robin
 Loved it . Loved it , loved it , loved it . And I got it signed .
 jenna wortham
 What wa your favorite part of the book ?
 robin
 My favorite part of the book wa the situation with the counselor .
 jenna wortham
 You mean the counselor who told her she couldn ’ t go to Princeton ?
 robin
 Yes . Yes . People would tell me all the time that I would never amount to anything and that I would have child by the time I wa 13 or 14 year old . It really bothered me when that happened . It made me sad . Like , how is this white person going to sit up here and telling me that I ’ m never going to amount to anything ? You don ’ t even really know me like that . You know me from a classroom perspective , but you don ’ t know my drive . You don ’ t know my will . You don ’ t know what I ’ m about . You don ’ t know what God ha laid out for me later on down the line .
 jenna wortham
 I felt the same way , Robin , reading the book . A lot of it moved me , too . And I also really remember being young and struggling with the outside world ’ s vision of me , or perception of who I wa , or who I wa going to be . And the tension between that , and who I thought I could be , and who I wanted to be . And I definitely had teacher question my potential , challenge my intellect . And so I totally feel you . That— it ’ s not a random experience . That ’ s actually a broader compression that happens to black girl .
 robin
 Right . Because that really inspired me to know that it happened to Michelle Obama . And boom , now look at me . I ’ m a nurse practitioner . But at the end of the day , I won the chess game . Checkmate . [ LAUGHING ]
 jenna wortham
 Love you , Robin . [ MUSIC - KINDNESS , “ WORLD RESTART ” ] I ’ m Jenna Wortham .
 wesley morris
 I ’ m Wesley Morris . And we ’ re two culture writer at The New York Times .
 jenna wortham
 This is Still Processing .
 wesley morris
 You know what ’ s funny about listening to my sister talk about Michelle Obama ?
 jenna wortham
 What ’ s that ?
 wesley morris
 It just put in perspective for me the seismic effect that this woman ha had on so many people .
 jenna wortham
 I ’ m glad it took a book for you to realize that . For me , it wa the moment— [ AUDIO PLAYBACK ] [ MUSIC - ETTA JAMES , “ AT LAST ” ] —she and Barack were seen on national TV dancing—
 beyonce
 ( SINGING ) At last .
 jenna wortham
 —to Beyonce singing Etta James , “ At Last. ” And yes , of course , I wa super happy . First black president— go , Barack . I wa happy . But I wa also just completely enamored and charmed by Michelle and that beautiful custom Jason Wu dress . Just the picture of elegance , the picture of beauty . And she ’ s a brown-skinned woman . She ’ s thick . She ’ s fit , but she ’ s thick . [ END PLAYBACK ] I had never seen any woman , any black woman on television like that before who wa not a fictional character .
 wesley morris
 Yes . And there wa something I will say triumphant and beautiful about that inauguration dance .
 jenna wortham
 Everything that happened while she wa on the campaign trail , all the vilification— the Fox News headline about Barack ’ s baby mama— that all happened before he wa elected . She had been attacked , her character had been assailed in the public eye . And you can only imagine what that experience doe to someone ’ s character , what that doe to someone ’ s sense of themselves , especially a a black woman . I mean , the dominant culture tell you you ’ re not good enough a it is . You ’ re not pretty enough , you ’ re not thin enough , you ’ re not white enough , your hair ’ s not straight enough . And so to see her up there confident , smiling , happy in love— It ’ s like when you go to the juice shop . And you feel OK , and you ’ re feeling pretty good , and you get your drink order . You think you ’ re being healthy enough . And they ask you , do you also want to add wheatgrass to it , or do you want the extra ginger boost ? And you ’ re like , I will get the ginger boost , because maybe you see something that I don ’ t know . Maybe you know something about what ’ s going around that I don ’ t know . I need a little extra vitamin today . Michelle is just that vitamin boost . She is that shot . She is just that thing that ’ s going to carry you through whatever you have to get through . And in that moment , I really saw it , and I really got it . And I wa , like , juiced . I wa , like , hype .
 wesley morris
 Wow . That sustained you for eight year .
 jenna wortham
 Yeah . And , you know , I want to be a parent , and I want to have a career . And I want to have an ambitious partner , and I want to support an ambitious partner . And so I think understanding that it ’ s possible in a way that I ’ ve never understood it wa possible wa also what sustained me , what nourished me .
 wesley morris
 I will say that there wa something about the idea that this woman wa going to go on a national book tour not at my local Barnes & Noble or my neighborhood bookstore—
 jenna wortham
 But with Live Nation . [ LAUGHING ]
 wesley morris
 She got Live Nation behind her—
 jenna wortham
 It ’ s amazing .
 wesley morris
 —to take her to the place where the NFL and the NBA play .
 jenna wortham
 I know . Where Janet Jackson sings . Where Beyonce performs . It ’ s amazing .
 wesley morris
 And to have these thing sell out a though it were Beyonce— it ’ s just mind-blowing to me . I did not see that coming . And the people who did see it coming—
 jenna wortham
 They bought ticket . They were smart . They knew . Like your sister . They knew what wa up .
 wesley morris
 Normally with a book like this , these are light , not interesting— it ’ s like Lean Cuisine memoir . It ’ s kind of healthy . You get a little jullienned carrot here and there .
 jenna wortham
 It ’ s like the gluten-free brownie that you get in a Lean Cuisine that get microwaved with everything else .
 wesley morris
 Ding-a-ding , ding , ding , ding .
 jenna wortham
 And after you eat the tasteless chicken breast , and the corn that didn ’ t completely thaw out , you get the little gooey brownie . And you ’ re like , OK , I guess that wasn ’ t so bad .
 wesley morris
 But this isn ’ t a Lean Cuisine meal ! This is actual nourishment . This is a meal ! And I think that she is being honest with u about a version of herself that existed before this man came into her life , and then the version of herself that came to be after this man come into her life .
 jenna wortham
 Well , Wesley , I think Michelle ’ s book come at a moment when we ’ ve spent eight year celebrating , analyzing , reveling in Barack ’ s presidency . And then we spent the last couple of year really dealing with the aftermath of that presidency with the subsequent presidency , that we didn ’ t really have a moment to think about Michelle ’ s contribution in all of this . And the book really give u the opportunity to think about her legacy and not just his . Her cultural imprint , not just his .
 wesley morris
 Well , let ’ s talk about that cultural imprint . We ’ re going to take a break and do that when we come back . [ MUSIC - KINDNESS , “ WORLD RESTART ” ] [ AUDIO PLAYBACK ]
 michelle obama
 There ’ s a lot I still don ’ t know about America , about life , about what the future might bring . But I do know myself . My father , Fraser , taught me to work hard , laugh often , and keep my word . My mother , Marian , showed me how to think for myself and to use my voice . Together in our cramped apartment on the South side of Chicago , they helped me see the value in our story , in my story , in the larger story of our country . [ END PLAYBACK ]
 wesley morris
 Becoming by Michelle Obama is officially an autobiography . But it is also a little self-help book . Not on purpose , not because Michelle Obama is saying you have to do anything . But there ’ s something about the way she ’ s saying how she did thing that make you think , this is how you should do it . Because she did this stuff , and it turned out pretty good for her . And I have to say , it is written very well . It is smooth .
 jenna wortham
 It ’ s very smooth .
 wesley morris
 It is writerly .
 jenna wortham
 But it is a Trojan horse . You ’ re right . It ’ s disguised a a book about her time in the White House , and it end up being this incredible memoir about her experience navigating the world a a black woman in a largely white world .
 wesley morris
 Yes .
 jenna wortham
 Even though she talk about growing up in this tight-knit Chicago , very black family . But she ’ s also talking about how she became herself in spite of the world ’ s expectation of her .
 wesley morris
 Yes . The idea that the same person who just want to be a good , well-respected , successful , average person is also this crazy , black , radical person who , when she get to Princeton , writes her senior thesis , it wa read a this black power manifesto . And you ’ re just like , who go to Princeton to write a black power manifesto ? [ LAUGHING ]
 jenna wortham
 Yeah .
 wesley morris
 What black person doe that ? You go to—
 jenna wortham
 Michelle Obama .
 wesley morris
 Right . [ LAUGHING ]
 jenna wortham
 Michelle Robinson Obama .
 wesley morris
 I wa surprised to learn how similar she and I are .
 jenna wortham
 Oh ! That ’ s exciting . You saw a bit of yourself in Michelle Obama ’ s story .
 wesley morris
 I did . I did . And the thing that she wanted out of life are the thing that a a kid I can remember wanting out of life and really believing I could get , no matter who told me I couldn ’ t have them .
 jenna wortham
 Like what ?
 wesley morris
 I wanted to learn a lot . I liked going to school .
 jenna wortham
 Yeah .
 wesley morris
 I liked answering question in class . I liked learning word and then using the word that I liked . One of the story in the book about her inquisitiveness come through in these piano lesson that she get with her great-aunt , Aunt Robbie . And there ’ s something about her determination to go faster than Robbie want her to go , because Robbie ’ s like , there ’ s a book . And we ’ re going to go from page one to page 265 in this book . And at some point , Michelle Obama learns the basic of how to play the piano in these song . And she ’ s like , you know what ? I think I get it . I ’ ma skip ahead . And Aunt Robbie is like , how dare you ? And Aunt Robbie is pissed . There are rule , young lady .
 jenna wortham
 Yes , there ’ s a path you follow . We don ’ t stray from the path . You start at the beginning , you make your way to the end . Michelle ’ s like , why ? Why would I do it that way ?
 wesley morris
 Right . And there ’ s something about this tradition in the black family about rule , and propriety , and respectability that stay with her . And it ha something to do with the simultaneous awareness of yourself a a proud black person , but also your awareness of yourself a a proud black person in a larger white world .
 jenna wortham
 Yeah . Well , there come a moment in most black child ’ s life in which you have an awakening . And that awakening is the realization that the wider world , maybe the wider white world , doesn ’ t think you can do what you want to do . Or doesn ’ t think that your ambition is valid . And what you do after that moment is pretty much what shape how you move through the rest of the world for the rest of your life .
 wesley morris
 Yes . And you know what I love about Michelle Obama ’ s relationship to that exact awareness ? Is it ’ s presented in the book a like , whatever . I applied to Princeton , I got in . I applied to Harvard Law School , I got in . Anyway .
 jenna wortham
 But that ’ s why the book , I think , ha struck a chord with so many people . Because it ’ s not called Overcoming .
 wesley morris
 Yes , yes .
 jenna wortham
 And it ’ s not called Awakening . It ’ s not Michelle Obama ’ s woke manifesto , right ? She isn ’ t trying to get you to empathize or champion how she overcame the obstacle that we all face in different variation , to different degree , on very different scale . She just want you to understand that she did it . And it ’ s a coping mechanism . It ’ s like , here ’ s how I survive , despite all the thing that we all come up against . And I think that ’ s why it resonated with Robin so much . Because it doesn ’ t matter that what Robin face every single day isn ’ t exactly what Michelle Obama face everyday . It ’ s just that they do have to face this challenge of proving yourself to other people .
 wesley morris
 But the other thing that ’ s interesting about the book— it ’ s divided into basically three part . There ’ s “ Becoming Me , ” there ’ s “ Becoming Us , ” and there ’ s “ Becoming More. ” I just want to say to the people responsible for this book , you guy are genius of structure . And I ’ m very jealous . The writer in me is salivating in envy . And the first part of the book is about her upbringing . And the degree to which she becomes aware of all of these conflicting urge and this awareness that she ’ s a product of the Great Migration , which is the move of black Southerners to the North because the racism in the South wa just too much .
 jenna wortham
 And the lack of job opportunity , and the segregation , and just all the remainder of the Jim Crow Era were just proving to be way too much . Had to go up North in search of better opportunity .
 wesley morris
 So she is a child of one of those many , many , many , family .
 jenna wortham
 And she ’ s very much a child of a generation that wasn ’ t going to waste the opportunity that they were given . Very much a child of people who said , you have to make your mark . Giving up is not an option . We worked too hard to get you here .
 wesley morris
 That wa my family .
 jenna wortham
 Yeah .
 wesley morris
 My family— nobody went to college in my family . Nobody wa able , I should say , to go to college in my family . So we were the first generation of kid who were able to do it . And so we went , because we knew it wa important . And it just put this premium on being the most , being the best . Her mother take her out of this failing Chicago school and put her into a better school . And at some point a an adult , she ’ s like , all these people are saying these wonderful thing about me . And all I ’ m here to say is , I ’ m lucky . I ’ m no better than anybody who wa at the school my mom took me out of . But she dared to take me out of that school and put me in a different one . And I wa lucky enough to be able to stay . But I think all the time about those kid that I left behind in second grade . Where are they ? They were just a smart a I wa . I wa just lucky enough to have the opportunity . And it haunt her . But this happens to all kind of black people all over the country .
 jenna wortham
 You kind of look back at your life and realized that there were a series of strategic intervention that helped course correct you , or helped encourage you on a particular path , that led you to another path , that opened a door , that led to a door . You crawled through a window , you went through a basement , you went around the corner , and then you figured it out . [ LAUGHING ] And there ’ s so much circumnavigation that ha to happen that , when you ’ re younger , you just take for granted . Or you don ’ t realize how influential and how instrumental change can be on your overall outcome . And so there is that moment of reflection a an adult , I think , that we ’ re both relating to in her recounting the series of event that led her to be where she wa . And having a mother like Marian who wa able— I mean , she credits— that ’ s one of the other remarkable things—
 wesley morris
 Marian Robinson , her mother .
 jenna wortham
 Her mother . She credit her mother over , and over , and over , and over again throughout the book a devoting her life to her and her brother Craig . Making sure they had dinner , making sure they had clean clothes . Even when Michelle Obama is essentially operating a a single parent because Barack ’ s so busy , and Michelle ’ s got two small girl , and she ’ s—
 wesley morris
 Needs to exercise .
 jenna wortham
 Needs to exercise , Marian say , all right , and start coming over at 4:45 in the morning to take care of the girl , and get them ready for daycare and for school so Michelle can go exercise . Michelle doesn ’ t hide the seam at which she almost came apart , and who wa there to pick her up and put her back together . And I think that acknowledgment mean so much , because a a woman , a a modern woman , there are these expectation or impression of how you ’ re supposed to hold it all together . And at least a far a I ’ m concerned , no one talk about the nitty-gritty of how it ’ s done . And I ’ m someone who need a blueprint . I need an instruction manual . I need to hear—
 wesley morris
 Oh , fascinating .
 jenna wortham
 —yeah , I had someone who wa willing to come at 5:00 AM and wa able to pick up these maternal responsibility so that I could go take care of my mental health . That ’ s the kind of insight that I actually need to know how to be a functional adult . You and I had similar childhood in that , also a first-gen college kid , I wa wholly unprepared for the experience of leaving home and going away . I wa raised with the idea that being an individual , having character , having a personality— all these thing would be enough to carry me into the real world . And I just had to worry about my own personal development in order to just be a functional human in the world . The hard slap of reality really hit me when I got to college and wa someone who never really saw themselves a a minority and realized how thoroughly minoritized I wa when I got to college . Whoever I thought I wa didn ’ t really matter if I wa going to matriculate into the black community there , matriculate into the white community there . Just be someone who didn ’ t want to be limited or constrained by race or gender , but realizing that there are these playbook in both of those intersection that I had to follow to have any sort of emblem , any sort of iota of success . I didn ’ t do very well . And so reading this book for me wa reading about someone who did do very well in those circumstance . And it wa like a lifeline . I wa like , yes , I need that life raft so I can try to swim back towards a ship that feel successful , because this is how Michelle Obama did it .
 wesley morris
 But it ’ s not a though Becoming is the first version of trying to offer woman a template by which to live successfully , especially in the workplace .
 jenna wortham
 Are you trying to bring up Lehman ?
 wesley morris
 I mean , maybe . Maybe I am . I mean , she ’ s already on the record a famously dismissing Sheryl Sandberg ’ s philosophy .
 jenna wortham
 Well , OK , she ’ s on the record alluding to the philosophy of Lean In , where she ’ s saying , in conversation with the illustrious poet Elizabeth Alexander , that Lean In ish doesn ’ t always work . The book Lean In came out in 2013— Sheryl Sandberg , who is famously the COO of Facebook . And she wrote a book basically saying , we can wait for the system to change , or we can be the change we want to be in the system . And a lot of her advice is really encouraging woman to set down their feeling of not enough-ness , and show up with more confidence , show up with more energy and enthusiasm , work smarter , not necessarily working harder . And she talk a lot about how she really push her partner , her husband , the late Dave Sandberg , to pick up his fair share of the parenting , right ? That ’ s her solution to how she manages it all . She make her husband do half of all the workload . Michelle Obama say several time throughout the book , probably the thing she talk about the most in the book is how Barack doesn ’ t really pick up the slack . He doesn ’ t cook . He doesn ’ t clean . He ’ s not really there to get the kid ready for school in the morning or put them to bed at night . And I don ’ t want to undermine the importance of that book when it came out . I mean , Sheryl Sandberg really introduced an entire generation of woman , myself included , to the notion of self-advocacy . Not waiting around for someone else to do it for you , that you had to really do it for yourself . And at the time , I wa working at The Times a a tech reporter , covering company like Instagram , Facebook , Tumblr , Reddit . And it wa deeply instrumental for me to understand how those company , those men— the people that I had to , to some degree , work alongside . And I wa at all these tech conference and at all these event where I wa one of very few woman in the room , and definitely one of the only black women— black people in the room , let alone black woman . And it worked to my advantage , because everybody knew who I wa , more or le . So that helped me out for year . But I think I did have to kind of embody a sort of confidence that Sheryl Sandberg wa talking about . It wa helpful for me to understand how she moved in those world so that I could move in those world . Now , the book ha been heavily criticized for— Sheryl doesn ’ t talk about the wealth that she ha access to , and the privilege that she ha access to , and the staff , and the resource that she ha access to be able to run a household . I couldn ’ t lean in a far Sheryl Sandberg wanted me to because I wa going to fall over . [ LAUGHING ] In fact , I used to tweet about leaning out . [ LAUGHING ] One of the key difference between that book and this book is Michelle Obama came up a a woman who wanted to change the system , and then at a certain point , because of the direction her life wa taking , realized , reluctantly , she would have to adapt to that system . She couldn ’ t change it . She had to adapt to it in order to try to hope to have some effect on it . And so the book is really the documentation of how she go from being this independent woman who ’ s trying to make a life for herself , and then trying to adapt to having the eye of the entire world more or le on her a she figured out how to comport herself to be the First Lady . Michelle wa never trying to be the First Lady . Michelle wa just trying to be her own lady .
 wesley morris
 A lot of this existential soul-searching she ’ s doing along the line of what kind of woman she should be , not just at work but in the home , and internally to herself , ha a lot to do with this almost biblical conundrum of female-hood to male-hood . And there ’ s something so vexing to her , because she recognizes herself a being this strong , independent , fierce , speaks her mind , take no prisoner sort of person . This is the person who disobeyed Aunt Robbie about the piano . And I think her whole life in her imagination of herself wa skipping ahead a bunch of chapters—
 jenna wortham
 Or she didn ’ t have to follow the rule to get ahead .
 wesley morris
 Right . She wind up marrying this dude who doesn ’ t even know there ’ s a book with music in it ! He just make up song on the piano ! And it ’ s just so infuriating to her that everything seems to come so easy to him .
 jenna wortham
 Yeah . Lightly veiled throughout the book is Michelle realizing that she and Barack function by different rulebooks . That he is allowed to be this free-spirited , noncommittal , perpetually late intellectual . Because he ’ s a man . And that continues even when he get into office , right ? You have this whole section of the book where Michelle go into detail about how important fashion became . [ AUDIO PLAYBACK ]
 michelle obama
 I knew a little bit about fashion , but not a lot . As a working mother , I ’ d really been too busy to put much thought into what I wore . It wa a thin line to walk . I wa supposed to stand out without overshadowing others . To blend in , but not fade away . As a black woman , too , I knew I ’ d be criticized if I wa perceived a being showy and high-end . And I ’ d be criticized also if I wa too casual . [ END PLAYBACK ]
 jenna wortham
 There start being article written about what she wa wearing , about how ripped her arm are . I adore have ripped her arm . That ’ s my aspiration , my armspo . Those arms— I don ’ t know why America had a problem with her physicality . I mean , I do know why , right ? Of course , historically , I know why it made her seem threatening , and too strong , and aggressive .
 wesley morris
 Any black woman ’ s body is a threat to somebody .
 jenna wortham
 —is subject— yeah . [ AUDIO PLAYBACK ]
 michelle obama
 Optics govern more or le everything in the political world , and I factored this into every outfit . It required time , thought , and money— more money than I ’ d spent on clothing ever before . It also required careful research by Meredith , particularly on foreign trip . She ’ d often spend hour making sure the designer , color , and style we chose paid proper respect to the people and country we visited . Meredith also shopped for Sasha and Malia ahead of public event , which added to the overall expense . But they , too , had the gaze upon them . [ END PLAYBACK ]
 jenna wortham
 And then she writes in the most scathing commentary ever— I love how gossipy this line is . [ AUDIO PLAYBACK ]
 michelle obama
 I sighed sometimes , watching Barack pull the same dark suit out of his closet and head off to work without even needing a comb . His biggest fashion consideration for a public moment wa whether to have his suit jacket on or off , tie or no tie . [ END PLAYBACK ]
 jenna wortham
 And I just feel like that condenses the woman ’ s liberation movement into the most succinct categorization ever . This is a woman who is so academically decorated , ha dedicated her life to public service , who now ha to spend 80 % of her time thinking about what she and her daughter are going to wear every time they leave the house ? It ’ s so maddening . But it tell the most distinct and perfect story of this country , of no matter how much a an individual you might think you are your own person , if you are in the public eye , and especially if you ’ re a woman , and if you are a black woman in the public eye , everything boil down to perception . And it ’ s just really a study in how not progressive we actually are a a nation . It really boggles the mind .
 wesley morris
 What you ’ re talking about on the one hand is practical , right ? You practically have to think about how to present yourself in order to make it through a day .
 jenna wortham
 Yes !
 wesley morris
 And if you ’ re lucky , or you have a sense of adventure or even just basic style , you are also doing something else , right ? You are moving into a realm that Michelle Obama , by dint of her position , wa shoved into , which is glamor and having to embody a kind of glamor—
 jenna wortham
 Ooh , interesting .
 wesley morris
 —and to basically present that to the world . And I think that it becomes for her— she doesn ’ t really articulate this in the book . It ’ s a burden for her . But the way I receive it is it is a language . It ’ s kind of a way to get herself into a room , and I mean into a room of people ’ s mind . And I think she ’ s a important a she is in part because she dressed beyond a part , and she became her own kind of glamor .
 jenna wortham
 Right . But the labor that Michelle is doing with her appearance , though , is much bigger than she let on in the book .
 wesley morris
 Yes .
 jenna wortham
 Because if you think about it , Michelle Obama is the direct product of a generation that fought really hard to end policy and law that deprioritized black people . But Michelle is picking up the mantle , or she ’ s picking up the baton , of another kind of work , which is undoing all the decade and century of racial stereotyping that people not just in this country , but people around the world—
 wesley morris
 Everywhere .
 jenna wortham
 —have about black people , and in particular , black woman . So hearing about this duality that Michelle Obama ’ s wrestling with , and the sort of tension between who she want to be for herself and who she need to be for the country— is that something you ’ re grappling with ? Because , I mean , we ’ re not about to be in the White House , but— [ SIGH ]
 wesley morris
 Here ’ s what I would say . I have been struggling with this very question since I got my first job . You know , I worked in a movie theater for— [ LAUGHING ] —for three summer ?
 jenna wortham
 I love this detail about you , by the way .
 wesley morris
 And I cleaned bathroom . I ripped ticket . And—
 jenna wortham
 Real .
 wesley morris
 —I can remember chasing after people in the lobby of this art house movie theater . I didn ’ t work at an AMC . It wa called The Ritz at the Bourse .
 jenna wortham
 Wow .
 wesley morris
 And I would have to , you know— “ Ma ’ am , ma ’ am ! You— you left your purse ! ”
 jenna wortham
 Geez .
 wesley morris
 And she ’ d turn around and be like , what ? What ?
 jenna wortham
 Oh , god .
 wesley morris
 Things like— but only because—
 jenna wortham
 Yes , yes .
 wesley morris
 —she see this black person running toward her—
 jenna wortham
 And her mind just fritzes .
 wesley morris
 —in a lobby full of white people . And so the point of a story like that is I eventually learned after that one time I wa like , “ Miss , miss ! ” You don ’ t do that . You can ’ t sneak up on anybody . [ LAUGHING ] But you also can ’ t shout after them . You have to figure out a way to get in their line of sight—
 jenna wortham
 Geez .
 wesley morris
 —so they can at least see you coming so they don ’ t freak out when they turn around and see you there . And I ’ m thinking about this a only because—
 jenna wortham
 Oh , my god .
 wesley morris
 —I am a black person .
 jenna wortham
 But this is exactly what I ’ m talking about , though , right ? We have this sense of who we are , and then we have this sense of who we need to be because of how white people have been conditioned—
 wesley morris
 And have conditioned u .
 jenna wortham
 —to interpret u , and receive u , and treat u . This is the double consciousness of our time . It really is .
 wesley morris
 Mm-hmm . Well , I mean , it doesn ’ t get any more double consciousness than , like , occupying the White House right a the First Lady .
 jenna wortham
 That ’ s like a fractal consciousness . That ’ s not even double . [ LAUGHING ] That ’ s like , you ’ re working with some sacred geometry there , like multidimensional .
 wesley morris
 And this is why I think— there are a lot of thing that are extremely ordinary about Michelle Obama that we place a great deal of importance on because she ’ s black . But then there are thing that shouldn ’ t be radical but just absolutely are because she wa a black First Lady . And it ’ s one of the thing I think a lot of people would agree is notable about her a an orator , and that is the speech she gave at the 2016 Democratic National Convention . [ AUDIO PLAYBACK ]
 michelle obama
 That is the story of this country . The story that ha brought me to this stage tonight . The story of generation of people who felt the lash of bondage , the shame of servitude , the sting of segregation . But who kept on striving , and hoping , and doing what needed to be done . So that today , I wake up every morning in a house that wa built by slaves— [ CROWD CHEERING ]
 wesley morris
 Where she talk about slave building the White House .
 michelle obama
 And— and I watch my daughter , two beautiful , intelligent , black young woman , playing with their dog on the White House lawn . [ CROWD CHEERING ] [ END PLAYBACK ]
 wesley morris
 Now , on the one hand , this is on page A22 of the newspaper , right ? This is barely even news . But coming from her , on that stage—
 jenna wortham
 Major .
 wesley morris
 —saying it the way she did—
 jenna wortham
 I wa like , she is really here for u , though . That wa also how you knew they weren ’ t going to let the experience of being in the White House fundamentally change their understanding and perception of who they were a black people . And that wa extremely important to know .
 wesley morris
 When you ask me this question about the awareness that I feel , and the responsibility that I feel , I feel like I represent 300 , 400 year of black Americans just by coming into work everyday .
 jenna wortham
 Yeah .
 wesley morris
 And it is simultaneously a great pleasure , and something I do with immense pride . But I also do it being fully aware that it took a lot of people to do a lot of dying , a lot of not eating , a lot of being locked up , for me to be able to do it . And I don ’ t do that lightly , either . I come to work everyday . And part of the reason I come to work everyday is because I wasn ’ t supposed to come to work at all . And I feel like that is a crazy thing to bring with you when you move through the world .
 jenna wortham
 I know .
 wesley morris
 But I can ’ t imagine sleeping in the White House every night under the same circumstance .
 jenna wortham
 That is the labor of the book , though , for , I think , young black Americans , right ? Which is , if they can survive that experience and come out relatively unscathed , which they appear to have done , then whatever minor challenge we ’ re facing today , we can do . We can handle it . [ MUSIC - KINDNESS , “ WORLD RESTART ” ] You know , Wesley , something that really struck me when I wa reading Becoming is how much of it fit into what I ’ m starting to see a a quickly growing category of book about and by black woman about their experience right now at this particular moment in America . I ’ m thinking of the book Thick by Dr. Tressie McMillan Cottom , Emergent Strategies by adrienne maree brown , Eloquent Rage by Dr. Brittney Cooper . And it ’ s really occurring to me that there is this category of these woman who are , in different way , only one in their own capacity . And by that , I just mean they are navigating entirely new circumstance a highly educated woman who have a very strong central identity a black women— in particular black feminist woman . Some of them are queer woman . And they ’ re writing firsthand account of what it ’ s like to move in these space and how they ’ re navigating . And it feel to me , a someone who ’ s deeply invested in these type of book and deeply invested in story about and by black woman , I haven ’ t really seen a wealth of book like these since the late ‘ 70 . I ’ m thinking of woman like Audre Lorde . I ’ m thinking of woman like Alexis Devoe and Cheryl Clarke .
 wesley morris
 Nonfiction work .
 jenna wortham
 Nonfiction work about the experience of being a black woman in America . And I ’ ve been thinking a lot about the exercise of consciousness raising and consciousness raising group and what that look like right now . I used to think it looked like Twitter , and it looked like social medium . But now I ’ m starting to think those platform are so dictated by algorithm and the very particular format that they allow publishing . So it ’ s hard to have continuous conversation about experience . You can share portion of your experience . You could parcel out your daily lived experience . But in term of having everything collected into almost a manifesto , or a diary , or a memoir— these book are really it for me .
 wesley morris
 Mm-hmm . Well , I think what ’ s really amazing about the arrival of this book is that it exists on that very continuum of black woman offering not just bread crumb , but proof of life .
 jenna wortham
 Yes !
 wesley morris
 Of having lived—
 jenna wortham
 Yes .
 wesley morris
 —in this country .
 jenna wortham
 ( SINGING ) I wa here .
 wesley morris
 Yes . Yes , exactly . And I think that what ’ s so amazing to me is that the very first example that we have of a black woman just documenting that she wa physically present in this country came in the thick of the 18th century . At the beginning of this country , at the beginning of bringing enslaved Africans to this new continent to work . And that person is Phillis Wheatley . And she wa a poet of her experience in this country . How she got here , what she wa made to do , how she didn ’ t like it . And they brought her from Gambia in Western Africa to Boston to be a slave . And lived for 31 year . That ’ s it . She died in 1784 and documented her time here a a slave and a a black woman . And the idea that you have the poetry of this woman from more than 250 year ago , and then this memoir of a woman who lived in a White House that wa responsible in some way for overseeing not only Phillis Wheatley ’ s being here , but her progeny spiritually , racially being free , is a lot to think about . And there wa a dinner that wa held for Michelle Obama a little bit before this book came out . And it wa a bit of a who ’ s who of great black woman of letter . So you have Jackie Woodson , the writer . You have Michele Norris , the journalist . Shonda Rhimes is at this dinner .
 jenna wortham
 Yes .
 wesley morris
 But you also have living in the stack academic like Erica Dunbar . And the thing that they ’ re all brought together to do is just to acknowledge the importance of this book .
 jenna wortham
 And it entrance into a canon .
 wesley morris
 Right . And the way this book wa received by these woman at this dinner wa a this testimonial of a legacy that really doe belong alongside Phillis Wheatley , and the work of Ida B . Wells , the journalist—
 jenna wortham
 Oh , my gosh . Yeah .
 wesley morris
 —and Fannie Lou Hamer . We ’ re treating her like a rock star in a way that we didn ’ t treat any of these other woman , because we could not .
 jenna wortham
 Yeah . That ’ s a good point .
 wesley morris
 We ’ re celebrating something that we couldn ’ t celebrate before . And that ’ s part of what ’ s electrifying about this moment , too .
 jenna wortham
 Yeah , absolutely .
 wesley morris
 It ’ s entirely possible that Phillis Wheatley could have sold out Lincoln Financial Field , too .
 jenna wortham
 If anyone had been allowed to leave and go .
 wesley morris
 Right . And so it ’ s just an astounding thing to think about this question of lineage .
 jenna wortham
 Yeah , absolutely .
 wesley morris
 And there ’ s something else about this book that I think is also really important to think about , which is it ’ s not a tragedy . It isn ’ t about how much this country made this woman suffer . It isn ’ t about the tragic thing that have happened to her . This is about the happiest and most positive depiction of a black woman ’ s treatment by her country . And it ’ s still not 100 % perfect , obviously . But it isn ’ t presented a bad news or a a wake-up call to a nation to treat u better . It is the rare story in this moment in which we are listening to a woman and believing her . And , I don ’ t know— that just really move me .
 jenna wortham
 We ’ re also at a really pivotal moment in history when you have a lot of woman of color trying to shape federal policy . And those woman , a they become visible , and a they enter into the realm of politics , they are finding themselves under the same kind of attack , vitriolic attack from the medium , from their opponent , that Michelle endured . And Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is constantly being attacked for how she looks— whether or not she wear red lipstick , and how much money she ha in her saving account . And this book effectively is a little bit of a guidebook . I think part of the reason this book work so well too is that Michelle repeat over and over again that she doe not like politics . She ha no interest in running . She ’ s just kind of here to share what she ’ s learned . And that apoliticality is useful , you can imagine , for woman like Stacey Abrams , and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , and for all of these woman who are going to be dealing with exaggerated version of what Michelle went through .
 wesley morris
 Yeah . It ’ s a political tool if not a work of politics , right ?
 jenna wortham
 Yes , absolutely .
 wesley morris
 I ’ m thinking about this book a also being about something that ’ s in progress , something that isn ’ t finished . And I love the structure of this book , but I also love that the structure of this book think about what the title of this book is . And I think Becoming a a title is just so perfect for Michelle Obama . It ’ s perfect for the nation . It ’ s perfect for the trap that is set by this nation for non-white , non-straight people . There ’ s both “ becoming ” in term of a thing that is constantly evolving— we are changing , we are progressing . And we ’ ve come to understand the importance of appearance and what is “ becoming ” of u a a people . What is becoming of u a black people , a woman , a any kind of person under the gaze of some larger system . And what that larger system say is becoming of you .

 Super Bowl LIII wa a low-scoring game , and the trailer that debuted during the telecast kept their running time down a well . The ad for the Dwayne Johnson-Jason Statham “ Fast & Furious ” spinoff , “ Hobbs & Shaw , ” wa a one-minute version of the three-minute trailer that wa released online Friday , and most of the other clip ran 30 second — or half that , in the case of teaser for “ Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark. ” Here ’ s this year ’ s lineup .
 [ How the Patriots ’ won their sixth Super Bowl . | A review of Maroon 5 ’ s halftime show . ]
 “ Captain Marvel ” ( March 8 ) : The latest ad for the superheroine vehicle start like a gender-switch reboot of “ Top Gun , ” a Carol Danvers ( Brie Larson ) and a fellow female Air Force pilot ( Lashana Lynch ) bond over their mutual need for speed . The commercial introduces a new catchphrase — “ higher , further , faster ” — and life up to it with a lightning-quick montage that set pulse racing .
 “ Avengers : Endgame ” ( April 26 ) : “ Where do we go , now that they ’ re gone ? ” read a sign in this spot . Of course , the Avengers aren ’ t all gone , even though many of them disintegrated at the end of “ Infinity War ” last year . We get glimpse of some survivor , like Ant-Man ( Paul Rudd ) , Hawkeye ( Jeremy Renner ) , Black Widow ( Scarlett Johansson ) , Thor ( Chris Hemsworth ) and Rocket Raccoon ( voiced by Bradley Cooper ) . “ Some people move on , ” say Steve Rogers ( Chris Evans ) , a.k.a . Captain America , “ but not us. ” Marvel fan won ’ t either , after this stirring teaser .
 “ Toy Story 4 ” ( June 21 ) : Forget Julian Edelman — Jordan Peele wa this year ’ s Super Bowl M.V.P . He appeared in an ad for his forthcoming CBS All Access remake of “ The Twilight Zone , ” rolled out another spot for his sophomore directorial effort , “ Us , ” and rejoined his old sketch-show pal Keegan-Michael Key to voice one of the stuffed animal who torment Buzz Lightyear ( Tim Allen ) in this amusing trailer for Pixar ’ s sequel . Does Peele ever sleep ?
 “ Us ” ( March 22 ) : After terrifying Christmas Day viewer with the first trailer for his follow-up to “ Get Out , ” Peele scored more scare with the second clip . The focus is on Lupita Nyong ’ o a a mother whose family of four face deadly doppelgängers while on a beach vacation from hell . There ’ s not a lot of new footage here , but the spot doe debut a clever tagline : “ Watch yourself. ” Indeed .
 “ Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark ” ( August ) : This quartet of 15-second mini-trailers is so dark and brief that it ’ s hard to tell what the hell ’ s going on , much le if it ’ s scary . The ad also promise that this adaptation of the best-selling young-adult book is “ from Guillermo del Toro , ” but the mastermind behind “ The Shape of Water ” only produced this movie — he didn ’ t direct it ( that would be Andre Ovredal ) . Boo !
 “ Wonder Park ” ( March 15 ) : “ This is beginning to feel like a terrible turn of event for u all , ” say John Oliver , perhaps all too aptly voicing a porcupine in this confusingly frenetic trailer for a cartoon about a young girl whose imaginary amusement park come to life . Is riding on a fish carousel really a common fantasy among child ? And what exactly are “ chimpanzombies ” ? The flying money from “ The Wizard of Oz ” were creepy enough , thanks .
 “ Alita : Battle Angel ” ( Feb. 14 ) : Rosa Salazar play the title role in this James Cameron-produced sci-fi drama , but the latest spot emphasizes Mahershala Ali — favored to win his second Oscar soon , for “ Green Book ” — a the film ’ s villain . In case you ’ re waiting to catch it on video , the ad declares , “ Some thing must be seen on the big screen ” and this is the “ must-see 3D cinematic event of the year. ” Sorry , but this desperate Hail Mary pas of a trailer smell of flop sweat .

 Letter of Recommendation
 By Mitch Moxley
 When I wa 9 , my dad took me to lunch at 360 Restaurant in Toronto ’ s CN Tower , then the tallest free-standing tower in the world . At the time , we lived in Saskatchewan , where my father wa a judge serving the remote , northern part of the province , flying into far-flung community for court . Though this eventually took a toll on my family , a a child I always associated my dad ’ s absence with romantic adventure , and this father-son trip to Toronto only deepened my sense that any life away from home wa one characterized by rich , unending discovery . It ’ s the visit to the CN Tower that still stand out most in my mind about that trip : Dining in a rotating restaurant in the sky , in a city so big that you could not clearly distinguish it edge , seemed to me the greatest thing in the world . Each moment , something new .
 For decade , the world ’ s most famous revolving restaurant wa located atop the Seattle Space Needle , which wa built for the 1962 World ’ s Fair and literally named for the Space Age optimism of the era . From the late 1950s through the ’ 70 , dozen of city in the United States and Europe built tower capped with rotating restaurant : the Florianturm in Dortmund , Germany ( 1959 ) , wa the first , followed by the Ala Moana Center in Honolulu ( 1961 ) . Many more popped up around the world — the BT Tower in London , the Grand Nile Tower in Cairo , the Holiday Inn in Beirut — until they fell out of favor in the 1980s and ’ 90 . You might reasonably dismiss revolving restaurant a kitsch , or worse : imperious eyesore , turning a city ’ s skyline into a tacky tribute to “ The Jetsons. ” That ’ s not to mention the food , which is a overpriced a it is beside the point . For me , these restaurant have always evoked the spirit of ridiculous audacity that many of our city lack today . They ’ re civic boosterism in physical form : We built a tower so you can properly enjoy the other tower we ’ re so proud of having built .
 A Connecticut-based company called Macton built the bulk of America ’ s revolving restaurant — more than 100 — during the trend ’ s glory day . The company still exists , but the reigning king of the rotating-restaurant space is now a Chinese firm called Weizhong . That should come a little surprise , considering that most of the world ’ s new revolving restaurant over the last 20 year have been built in Asia . My own wandering , both professional and personal , eventually took me there for many year abroad , mostly in China . In Asia , audacity reign . Ceaseless development is certainly not good in and of itself , but it doe , at least to some degree , speak to the prevailing sentiment of a people .
 Every time I took the train from Beijing to Shanghai , there seemed to be a new skyline-defining building twisting into the cloud . I went on a reporting trip to Guangzhou , a city that I had scarcely heard of , and found that from almost any vantage point of modest height , you could spot an enormous tower . It wa the Canton Tower , which , at 1,982 foot , surpassed the CN a the world ’ s tallest free-standing tower when it opened in 2010 — and yes , it had a revolving restaurant . ( It ha since been surpassed by a tower in Tokyo , topped by a restaurant that doesn ’ t revolve . )
 Once , on an assignment in North Korea , I had a beer in the revolving restaurant on top of the Yanggakdo International Hotel , whose fortresslike structure in Pyongyang is one of the few place in the capital where foreigner are allowed to stay . The restaurant spun so slowly you could barely tell , offering view of what wa a pretty spectacular city , at least to the eye : Futuristic skyscraper , monument to the leader , urban sprawl out to the mountain . Unmissable wa the Ryugyong Hotel , the unfinished pyramidal structure that wa to feature not one but five rotating restaurant . Pyongyang may be decade behind it neighbor , but the tower said otherwise : Ours is a city to behold , to marvel at .
 When I moved to New York City from Beijing in 2013 , I had the surreal feeling that I had come from the future to a not-so-distant past . In China , I ’ d experienced six year of near relentless optimism . In the United States , I encountered a kind of pessimism and listlessness that I didn ’ t expect . It wa almost a if Americans had settled for a kind of Yelp-reviewed urban sameness : third-wave coffee shop and facsimile of Brooklyn bar . The same is true in Europe . Same polished concrete floor , same nebulous sense of where you are . Purgatory is a cafe stacked with Kinfolk .
 I started to wonder if New York even had a revolving restaurant , and I wa happy to find that it did : the View , which opened in the Marriott Marquis in Times Square almost 35 year ago . I met a friend there for drink after work one day . A John Mayer song wa playing , and there wa a buffet with a chocolate fountain . I ordered a gin martini with a lemon twist . The rotation wa faster than I thought it would be — a 360-degree turn per hour — resulting in a slightly disorienting feeling that went well with alcohol . Our server told u that when she travel , she like to check out the competition , visiting revolving restaurant in city such a Auckland , New Zealand ; Hong Kong ; and Vancouver , British Columbia — a fact my companion and I found delightful a we sipped our second martini , marveling at the sheer might and scale of Midtown Manhattan a it silently zipped by . I found myself relieved by a gentle reminder that maybe I ’ d come to the right place , after all — New York City , this great experiment . The audacity still exists here . You just have to look for it .

 Two week ago , the big movie studio showcased their 2019 lineup for multiplex executive in a series of elaborate marketing presentation in Las Vegas . It ’ s an annual ritual : Here are the potential hit we will deliver .
 For the first time , the importance of onscreen diversity came across a more than lip service . Paramount presented a family adventure ( “ Dora the Lost City of Gold ” ) with a predominantly Latino cast , while Warner Bros. promoted a “ Shaft ” sequel starring Samuel L. Jackson and Regina Hall . Universal touted a comedy starring black woman ( “ Little ” ) , an animated movie about a Chinese girl ’ s quest ( “ Abominable ” ) and a summer musical ( “ Yesterday ” ) with an actor of Indian descent playing the lead .
 But look a little closer at the movie on studio roster — and who is directing them — and Hollywood ’ s inclusion narrative fall apart by one crucial measure . Even after year of being called to task for sidelining female filmmaker , studio a a whole continue to rely overwhelmingly on men to lead production .
 Why the disconnect ?
 Studios have multiple explanation ( some would say excuse ) , but one big reason involves a lack of economic pressure . Moviegoers have been responding favorably to diverse casting and story ( “ Us , ” “ Crazy Rich Asians , ” “ Black Panther ” ) , prompting studio to serve up more . Fewer ticket-buying decision are made based on the gender of the filmmaker , however .
 “ Does a consumer care about how something is made versus what they see onscreen ? ” Cathy Schulman , an Oscar-winning producer ( “ Crash ” ) , said in an interview . “ I think that is becoming increasingly more important , but I would say the business is slower to see the connectivity . ”
 That most studio employ few female director would not surprise anyone who ha been paying attention to the research from academic like Stacy L. Smith at the University of Southern California . But most report on Hollywood hiring offer a rearview portrait ; compiling comprehensive data requires a lag .
 So the of-the-moment snapshot provided by the recent studio presentation is striking .
 During it session on April 3 at CinemaCon , a convention staged by the National Association of Theater Owners , Disney unveiled a 19-film slate for the rest of 2019 , including a batch of movie from the newly acquired 20th Century Fox . Two of the 19 come from woman : Jennifer Lee co-directed “ Frozen II ” and Roxann Dawson directed “ Breakthrough , ” a faith-based drama .
 Warner Bros. ha 15 film , three of which have a woman behind the camera . ( The next one is “ The Sun Is Also a Star , ” a romance from Ry-Russo-Young , which Warner will release on May 17 . ) Paramount currently plan to release seven movie by the end of the year ; “ The Rhythm Section , ” a thriller , is the only one directed by a woman . ( That would be Reed Morano , best known a a cinematographer . )
 Universal Studios ha 15 movie with release date through December . Four come from woman , including “ Little , ” which arrived over the weekend and wa directed by Tina Gordon , and “ Queen & Slim , ” a November drama directed by Melina Matsoukas .
 Sony Pictures opted not to make a presentation at CinemaCon . The studio ha 13 movie on the remainder of it 2019 schedule . Women are directing three of them : “ Charlie ’ s Angels ” ( Elizabeth Banks ) ; “ A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood ” ( Marielle Heller ) ; and “ Little Women ” ( Greta Gerwig ) .
 Disney , Warner , Universal and Sony declined to comment or did not respond to a request for comment .
 Paramount said in a statement , “ We recognize that , a an industry , we need to afford more opportunity to female film director , and at Paramount we have publicly committed to doing a better job. ” Paramount added that , under an initiative announced in February , all of the studio ’ s film and television project must submit a “ diversity and inclusion plan ” before greenlight . Paramount is also participating in a Time ’ s Up-backed effort to boost opportunity for female director .
 The only studio executive who agreed to be interviewed for this article wa Adam Fogelson , the chairman of STXfilms Motion Picture Group , a five-year-old operation . Much of it output involves female-focused movie like the Amy Schumer vehicle “ I Feel Pretty , ” directed by Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein .
 “ We ’ re proud of our track record of making film for , with and by woman , ” Mr. Fogelson said . “ We see it a an important competitive edge. ” He added , however , “ As a husband , a father and a human being in the world , I ’ m eager for the industry to collectively do better on this front . ”
 STX currently ha six film headed to theater by the end of the year , two of which have female director . The first is “ Poms , ” a comedy from Zara Hayes that arrives on May 10 . But Mr. Fogelson said a few month ’ worth of film did not give a sufficient assessment . By his calculation , 18 percent of all STX movie , past and present , have been ( or are being ) directed by woman — and 14 percent have a woman a lead actor , director , producer and writer .
 Widening the aperture make the picture more positive for every studio . Disney recently released “ Captain Marvel , ” with Anna Boden a a director ; in the work are two more Marvel film from woman ( “ Black Widow ” and “ The Eternals ” ) . Warner will release a pair of female-led superhero movie of it own in 2020 — “ Wonder Woman 1984 , ” from Patty Jenkins , and “ Birds of Prey , ” from Cathy Yan . At least 10 film with female director are in development at Paramount , including a new “ Star Trek . ”
 The higher the financial risk , though , the le confidence decision maker have in hiring woman . So , major studio film remain the slowest to embrace opportunity parity . Ms. Schulman , who is a former president of the advocacy group Women in Film , also pointed to the misconception that woman are best at directing personal story about woman and romance , excluding them from opportunity to direct genre associated with men , like action , adventure , espionage , broad comedy , horror , sci-fi and others .
 Martha Lauzen , the executive director of the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film and a professor at San Diego State University , cited research showing that woman accounted for 8 percent of director working on the top 250-grossing movie of 2018 , down one percentage point from 1998 .
 “ We have not seen any meaningful increase , ” she said , “ in the percentage of woman film director over the last 20 year . ”

 I ate many great dish when I wa restaurant critic for The New York Times , and many awful one too . The plate of the dreadful — dumpling that tasted of soap , stuffed squid the texture of rubber , rancid chicken , frozen tomato — I can hardly differentiate in my mind . They left me dismayed in the moment , occasionally angry , sometimes laughing right there at the table a I called for a check . ( Sometimes I can laugh even still : That really wa a cigarette butt in the salad ! )
 The great one , though , could sear themselves into my memory , become lodestar of delight . I can call up some of their scent , their flavor and beauty and revisit my astonishment at their perfection even now , year after I stopped eating out six night a week for money and started to cook instead .
 A few of those dish I made for myself at home , cooking not from a recipe so much a from my recollection of the night itself , of what the dish tasted like and how it made me feel . I have a particular , joyful memory of a pressed duck I ate at Daniel in Manhattan once , of the perfect mineral taste of the blood-enriched sauce that cloaked the bird ’ s flesh , so red above the starched white tablecloth . My attempt to cook it , though , even with fine Madeira and Cognac to amplify the butter , even with a nicely set table and candle winking , were failure every time . The duck wa never better than pretty good . The kitchen looked like the set of a horror film . Alchemy ’ s a myth . ( Also , I don ’ t have a duck press . )
 Sometimes , though , my lead can turn gold . Such wa the case with the meatloaf I devoured in the dining room of M. Wells in Queens , a stainless-steel diner in Long Island City that wa then occupied by the chef Hugue Dufour and his wife , Sarah Obraitis . Today Dufour and Obraitis run a successful steakhouse in a renovated auto-body shop in the same neighborhood , and a cafe in nearby MoMA PS1 a well . Then they were just starting out , and M. Wells had the antic , adrenalized feel of punk rock or experimental theater . The food nodded at France and Canada and , yes , American diner , also at excess and excess squared . There wa a lot of foie gras .
 We ’ d had some already that night , a well a a platter of snail served in the trench of beef bone sawed in two , beneath pat of marrow . We ’ d had another of oyster with coffee sabayon and a third of Caesar salad made with smoked herring , beneath a snowdrift of grated Parmesan . It wa already an astonishing meal .
 But then there wa this meatloaf . It wa made , the waiter said , of aged ground beef baked in a cake mold , with Stroganoff sauce and foie gras . It took a while for u to get it because there wa a fire that night in a ceiling vent , and we had to spend part of the meal standing on a rainy sidewalk across the street from the diner watching Dufour scramble around on the roof putting it out , but it seemed in the end to be a perfectly acceptable delay . The beef wa soft with crisp edge , with a funkiness to it that matched the sweet , unctuous quality of the sauce . We marveled at it the way people marvel at the ballet , at painting that haunt .
 I dreamed of that meatloaf , dream of it still , and I ’ ve made version of it with beef and lamb and pork , cooked stovetop Stroganoffs made with mushroom both wild and supermarket-bland . I ’ ve spooned canned foie gras into my meatloaf mixture to mimic the original , and I ’ ve dotted it into the finished sauce a well . That last maneuver wa in truth more successful , providing pop of richness against the silkiness of the cream , but I ’ ve also omitted the foie entirely and no one ha been the poorer . You can make like Dufour and deglaze your mushroom with strong tea — a Canadian technique that underscore Quebec ’ s independence from French wine — but I prefer using plain stock , a I do the use of finely chopped parsley on the finished dish . Dufour opts for dill , rarely used on meat .
 The adaptation hardly matter , really . Make a good and juicy meatloaf with the best meat you can find , and cover it with mushroom and cream . You ’ ve got a meal to suggest magic , particularly this time of year .
 “ I don ’ t know where it came from , ” Dufour said when I called him to talk about the dish . “ I mean , I like Stroganoff . And I had all these aged meat scrap I bought from Pat LaFrieda , ” the well-known restaurant-industry butcher . He put the two together , a rich meatloaf and then a richer sauce atop it . He thought it wa an example of the generosity of spirit he learned a a young chef in Montreal , working at Au Pied de Cochon , a restaurant of pig ’ head and the fattened liver of bird , blood sausage and maple syrup . “ It ’ s about giving more than expected , ” Dufour said . “ Not just a meatloaf but a meatloaf with more . ”

 LOS ANGELES — The fire that devastated Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris on Monday prompted fund-raising appeal in the United States , a people horrified by the blaze began making commitment to restore a global landmark even before the flame were extinguished .
 The New York-based French Heritage Society and the Go Fund Me crowdsourcing platform were among the first to offer help for a cathedral that is a must-see destination for visitor to Paris from all over the world .
 French President Emmanuel Macron said an international campaign would be launched to raise fund for the rebuilding of Notre-Dame Cathedral . [ nP6N21F04Z ]
 The French Heritage Society , an American non-profit group dedicated to preserving French architectural and cultural treasure , launched a web page on Monday to raise money for the cathedral 's restoration .
 `` Notre-Dame is obviously an architectural marvel and most certainly a monument that should be restored , '' Jennifer Herlein , the executive director of the society , said by phone .
 Herlein could not immediately say how much her organization had raised for Notre-Dame on Monday . Eventually , the fund raised will go directly to the cathedral , she said .
 The organization , which wa founded in 1982 , gave two grant last year totaling more than $ 430,000 for restoration project at France 's national library , she said .
 50 CAMPAIGNS
 At the website GoFundMe , more than 50 campaign related to the cathedral fire had been launched globally on Monday , John Coventry , a spokesman for Go Fund Me , said by email .
 `` In the coming hour we 'll be working with the authority to find the best way of making sure fund get to the place where they will do the most good , '' Coventry said .
 Some of the Go Fund Me campaign had not listed any money raised by late Monday , and several joke campaign were created through Go Fund Me to help Quasimodo , the fictional character in Victor Hugo 's 19th century novel `` The Hunchback of Notre-Dame . ''
 `` I think the challenge will be whether or not people who give the money agree with those who are doing the rebuilding about how the cathedral should be rebuilt , '' said Lisa Bitel , a professor of religion and history at the University of Southern California .
 `` This is a national monument in France and they will not spare money to rebuild , '' Bitel said . `` I do n't think the Americans will get much of a say in how to do it . ''
 Notre-Dame Cathedral ha looked to international donor for past renovation effort .
 In 2017 , Michel Picaud , president of Friends of Notre-Dame De Paris , told the New York Times his group planned to organize gala dinner , concert and other event to raise fund in France and the United States for restoration work at the cathedral .

 Speaking from more than 400 foot below the surface of the Indian Ocean , the president of the Seychelles made an impassioned plea on Sunday to protect the world ’ s sea .
 Calling ocean the “ beating blue heart of our planet , ” the president , Danny Faure , said the sea had “ a special relationship with all of u . ”
 Mr. Faure , dressed in salmon-colored short and a T-shirt with the Seychelles flag , gave his speech from a submersible craft that had dived to 406 foot off Desroches Island in the Seychelles , part of a series of scientific mission to explore and protect the Indian Ocean .
 Marveling at the underwater beauty and biodiversity of his surroundings , Mr. Faure called for more protection for the ocean ’ s ecosystem .
 “ It keep the planet alive , it keep u alive , and it is clear to me that it is under threat like never before , ” he said .
 The Seychelles , a chain of island off eastern Africa , face an existential threat from climate change and rising sea level . The country , along with other small island nation , is expected to bear the brunt of global warming , including the loss of fresh water , land erosion , dying coral reef and the increased frequency of extreme weather event .
 While global power have gathered repeatedly for summit meeting on how to reduce and mitigate carbon emission , island nation have expressed increasing desperation at the lack of meaningful action .
 “ The ocean is huge , covering almost 70 percent of our planet , but we have managed to seriously impact this vast environment through climate change , ocean acidification , overfishing , plastic and other pollution , ” Mr. Faure said , adding , “ We need decisive , coordinated , international action . ”
 The series of scientific expedition , called First Descent , wa organized by Nekton , a nonprofit research institute , in collaboration with the University of Oxford .
 The Seychelles mission ha included 75 dive so far and ha created 3-D map of the seabed from seven research site , according to a statement issued by Mr. Faure ’ s government .
 In an Instagram post on Saturday , Mr. Faure said the effort showed “ the importance of conserving our ocean . ”
 Plastic pollution ha become a particular focus in the fight to keep ocean clean a large amount of garbage are released into the world ’ s sea every year . Over the past month , in Italy , the Philippines and elsewhere , dead whale have washed ashore with dozen of pound of plastic in their stomach .
 An estimated eight million ton of plastic wind up in the sea every year , according to the World Wildlife Fund .
 Oceans are major producer of oxygen — due largely to the action of phytoplankton , tiny single-celled ocean plant — and they absorb half of all climate-warming carbon dioxide , according to the organization . But the total amount of vertebrate sea life , including fish , ha reduced by more than a third since 1970 , the fund said .

 Its wingspan is longer than a football field . The tail is 50 foot from the ground . It wa made by reassembling part from two used Boeing jetliner .
 On Saturday , the world ’ s largest airplane took flight for the first time .
 The twin-fuselage plane , called the Stratolaunch , flew for about two and a half hour over the Mojave Desert in Southern California , reaching a speed of 189 mile per hour and an altitude of 17,000 foot in it maiden voyage , the Stratolaunch team said .
 “ The flight itself wa smooth , which is exactly what you want the first flight to be , ” Evan Thomas , a test pilot with Scaled Composites who flew the Stratolaunch , said at a news briefing . “ And for the most part , the airplane flew a predicted , which is again exactly what we want . ”
 The vessel , the largest plane by wingspan , is designed to carry rocket to blast commercial satellite into space . The company is betting that doing so would be more efficient than launching them from the ground , which is an approach of several other space-minded company .
 Paul G. Allen , a founder of Microsoft , funded the project and announced plan for Stratolaunch in 2011 . Mr. Allen died in October , prompting question about the initiative ’ s future . The company declined to say how much the project cost .
 Never miss an eclipse , a meteor shower , a rocket launch or any other astronomical and space event that 's out of this world .
 In August , Stratolaunch said it wa developing a “ family of launch vehicle ” that could be deployed from the plane to carry satellite . But in January the company scaled back those effort .
 There have been concern about how Stratolaunch ’ s business will work once it take on customer , with some questioning whether a trend toward smaller satellite would dampen demand for such a large plane .
 Even so , the flight on Saturday wa billed a a milestone and an engineering marvel .
 “ All of you ’ ve been very patient and very tolerant over the year waiting for u to get this big bird off the ground , and we finally did it , ” Jean Floyd , chief executive of Stratolaunch , said at the briefing .
 The team on Saturday checked the plane ’ s handling , and tested roll and yaw .
 Mr. Thomas said there were a “ few little thing that were off nominal ” but the company did not immediately specify what those were .
 “ The airplane felt really nice on the touchdown , gear felt good , ” Mr. Thomas said . “ We had a couple of correction to line up in the slowdown and ended up rolling to a stop pretty much where we wanted to coming off the runway .
 “ So it wa overall fantastic . ”
 Stratolaunch said that by launching rocket from the air , it can “ circumvent bad weather , air traffic and other variable that cause delay with traditional ground launch . ”
 Executives have also said the plane can easily move to area that are better suited for launching satellite into certain orbit , although it need a landing strip that can handle it great size .

 Architecture is , by it nature , an imposition . It ’ s other thing a well , of course : At it most basic , it offer shelter ; at it best , it offer provocation , an invitation to marvel at what the imagination can conjure and engineering can accomplish .
 In the modern era , technology ha made heretofore impossible construction reality . And yet what ’ s le discussed is how it ha also enabled building that are remarkable for their modesty , for how they try not to supersede the reality of their surrounding geography , but accommodate themselves to it . The result are act of artistic humility , man recognizing his smallness in the face of natural force so great they can not be resisted or overcome , but must rather be acknowledged and respected .
 This is particularly true in area known for their earthquake , where tectonic activity help determine aesthetic — Chile , for example , is one of the most seismically active country on earth ; it 1960 Valdivia earthquake , which measured 9.5 on the moment magnitude scale , remains the most powerful recorded tremor in history . It is this vulnerability that , a Michael Snyder writes in his story about Modernist Chilean architecture , prevented local architect “ from building with the gravity-defying exuberance deployed by , say , Oscar Niemeyer in Brazil ... or with the brittle transparency favored by American icon like Richard Neutra and Frank Lloyd Wright . Chile ’ s geography make those kind of building impossible ... thin wall and slender pilaster crack a the ground shift beneath them. ” Yet , a one of the architect Snyder speaks to note , these restriction have inspired a site-specific kind of design , one born from necessity but distinguished by it particularity . In recognition of their geography , the Modernist building here tend to be earthbound ( and , unlike many celebrated work of contemporary architecture , made with relatively little glass ) ; more poetically , they also offer expansive , panoramic view wherever possible , so that their inhabitant are never able to forget their tenuous stake in the earth , the transience of their existence . There is nothing timorous about these building — they prove that beauty can be created , and people can live , even in challenging circumstance — but nor are they arrogant : They are response to their context , and they are aesthetically distinguished because of it .
 They are also a good reminder to all of u who make thing in difficult circumstance , be they climactic , geographic or political : As long a there are human , there will be art — and nothing will ever stop u from trying to make our life more beautiful . Beauty and artistic innovation may not be right , like water or food or clean air or free will , but they are impulse , and our desire for them is an important part of what make u human . As doe our relentless pursuit of them ... no matter the hardship , and no matter the context .

 LOS ANGELES — Warner Bros. ha finally earned back the benefit of the doubt when it come to it all-important superhero movie : “ Shazam ! ” became the studio ’ s third nonsequel comic-book hit in a row over the weekend , arriving to applause from critic and stout ticket sale of nearly $ 156 million worldwide .
 “ We really want these movie to stand on their own , with filmmaker best suited to the character , ” Toby Emmerich , chairman of the Warner Bros. Pictures Group , said by phone on Sunday morning . “ We ’ re all feeling deservedly really good . ”
 “ Shazam ! ” wa the No . 1 movie in North America , collecting $ 53.5 million over the weekend , according to Comscore , which compiles box-office data . Paid preview in partnership with Fandango in late March , designed to prompt positive chatter online , added $ 3.33 million . “ Shazam ! ” also had a solid start in country like Mexico and Russia .
 [ Read our critic ’ s take on “ Shazam ! ” ]
 Second place at the domestic box office went to a remake of “ Pet Sematary ” ( Paramount ) , based on the novel by Stephen King . It took in an estimated $ 25 million . Disney ’ s big-budget “ Dumbo ” trundled along in third place , selling $ 18.2 million in ticket , for a sad two-week total of $ 76.3 million .
 “ Shazam ! ” wa made by New Line , a division of Warner that focus on lower-cost film that often serve a counterprogramming . Made for about $ 100 million — about 40 percent le than most superhero movie — “ Shazam ! ” tell the story of a teenage boy ( played by Asher Angel , known for Disney Channel ’ s “ Andi Mack ” ) who can turn himself into a hero with an adult body ( Zachary Levi ) and unique power .
 “ New Line always thought that ‘ Big ’ a a superhero movie wa a great idea , a way to make the genre feel fresh and different , ” Emmerich said .
 Warner ha spent the better part of a decade trying to get it act together with movie based on character from it DC Comics division — an imperative given the runaway success of rival Marvel Studios and the film industry ’ s increasing need for spectacle that audience see a worth a trip to theater . Part of the problem wa that Warner stuck for too long with a dark vision for it superhero universe , set by the filmmaker Zack Snyder , that wa clearly not working . That led to creative and financial mess like “ Suicide Squad ” and “ Justice League . ”
 But the studio , having largely jettisoned Snyder ’ s plan and shaken up it executive rank , including promoting Emmerich , ha started to deliver superhero home run on a consistent basis : “ Wonder Woman ” from Patty Jenkins , “ Aquaman ” from James Wan , and seemingly “ Shazam ! , ” which wa directed by a relative newcomer , David F. Sandberg .
 Where the PG-13 “ Shazam ! ” will end up at the box office remains a bit of a question mark given the impending arrival of “ Avengers : Endgame. ” Ticket buyer gave “ Shazam ! ” an A grade in CinemaScore exit poll , an indication of staying power .

 “ Avengers : Endgame ” isn ’ t the only Marvel franchise to release the last trailer for it supposedly final installment this week . The “ X-Men ” series is also coming to a close with “ Dark Phoenix . ”
 “ We ’ re doing space mission now ? ” X-Men ’ s Quicksilver ( Evan Peters ) asks . “ Cool. ” Or maybe not : thanks to the superhero squad ’ s interstellar rescue expedition , Jean Grey ( Sophie Turner ) morphs into an apparently evil — and seemingly invincible — mutant nicknamed Phoenix . “ When I lose control , bad thing happen , ” she say . “ But it feel good. ” Still , the trailer ’ s most shocking sight might be Jessica Chastain , who trade her red hair for a white-blond mane a Phoenix ’ s mentor .
 After dropping a three-minute trailer just before Super Sunday , the Dwayne Johnson-Jason Statham vehicle go even longer with a 217-second follow-up . ( We ’ ll wait while you do the math . ) In this ridiculously stunt-packed clip , the American security agent and the British mercenary put aside their personal and cultural difference to face off against a genetically enhanced villain ( Idris Elba ) who declares himself “ the Black Superman. ” The action span the globe from Britain to Hawaii , where Hobbs enlists his brother for some old-school hand-to-hand combat . Fast : Check . Furious : Check .
 The initial teaser for this horror-movie reboot gave u only a glance at the demonic doll Chucky , but the first trailer let u hear him — and he sound a bit like Luke Skywalker . That ’ s because Mark Hamill replaces Brad Dourif a the voice of the murderous dummy , who wish his young owner , Andy ( Gabriel Bateman ) , a deeply creepy “ good night. ” As the spot note , the new “ Child ’ s Play ” come from the producer of “ It . ”
 Gabriel Bateman ’ s in jeopardy again , this time when his character disappears into the animated world of the titular toy line , and his sister ( Anya Taylor-Joy ) must go on an adventure to retrieve him . The round-handed action figure are more popular in Europe than the United States . ( It ’ ll hit British theater on Aug. 9 ; an American release date hasn ’ t been set yet . ) The trailer ’ s generic gag don ’ t help , either . Even with Harry Potter himself , Daniel Radcliffe , giving voice to the spy Rex Dasher , “ Playmobil : The Movie ” seems le than magical .
 Forgive u if we don ’ t trust Allison Williams after her character ’ s startling switcheroo in “ Get Out. ” She ’ s back in another horror flick — this one will debut on Netflix — and she seems to be up to no good again . In this one , she play a cellist who ’ s ostensibly bent on revenge against a younger rival ( Logan Browning ) . The trailer give away one of the movie ’ s biggest twist , so if you don ’ t want it spoiled , don ’ t watch . But there are plenty more scare in store : Think “ Black Swan ” with string .

 When it come to Beyoncé release , there is usually an element of surprise .
 The singer — who perfected the secret album drop in 2013 , and ha since toyed with the tactic for release like “ Lemonade ” and “ Everything Is Love , ” with her husband Jay-Z — did it again in the early morning hour Wednesday , one-upping the arrival of her own Netflix documentary , “ Homecoming , ” with a previously unannounced live-album version of the same concert .
 [ Read our review of the Beyoncé documentary “ Homecoming . ” ]
 Both the film and the album , also titled “ Homecoming , ” capture Beyoncé ’ s performance at last year ’ s Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival , in which the singer — the first black woman to headline the event — wa backed by dozen of dancer and an elaborate marching band for a set that nodded to the musical legacy of historically black college .
 “ There ’ s not likely to be a more meaningful , absorbing , forceful and radical performance by an American musician this year , or any year soon , ” the critic Jon Caramanica wrote of the show in The New York Times . “ It wa rich with history , potently political and visually grand . By turn uproarious , rowdy , and lush . A gobsmacking marvel of choreography and musical direction . ”
 Now , the concert — which wa live-streamed at the time and recreated for Coachella ’ s second weekend , but ha existed only in bootleg form since — ha been preserved for history in multiple medium . The documentary , a Netflix exclusive billed a “ a film by Beyoncé , ” feature footage from rehearsal and quieter backstage moment — “ the emotional road from creative concept to cultural movement , ” Netflix said .
 “ Homecoming : The Live Album ” is a more straightforward recreation of the concert that became known a Beychella . It break the more than two-hour performance into 40 track , many of which are packed with multiple musical reference and section of other song .
 [ 5 thing we learned from Beyoncé ’ s Coachella doc “ Homecoming . ” ]
 Beyoncé ’ s set list , which varied slightly over the two Coachella performance , included solo hit like “ Get Me Bodied , ” “ Baby Boy ” and “ Formation , ” the Destiny ’ s Child song “ Say My Name ” and “ Soldier ” ( with her former group mate Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams ) and various interlude with title here such a “ So Much Damn Swag ” and “ The Bzzzz Drumline. ” She also included a rendition of the hymn “ Lift Every Voice and Sing , ” a song often referred to a the black national anthem .
 The album also includes an a cappella version of “ Lift Every Voice and Sing ” by Blue Ivy , Beyoncé and Jay-Z ’ s oldest daughter , and two bonus track : a new cover of “ Before I Let Go , ” the 1981 song by Maze featuring Frankie Beverly , which appears in the end credit of the documentary , and an alternate version of “ I Been On . ”
 While some recent Beyoncé release have been available , at least for a time , only on Tidal , the streaming service owned by Jay-Z , the live album wa released across all major streaming platform , including Apple Music , Spotify and Google Play .
 Since Coachella , Beyoncé ha been largely quiet professionally , though she toured with Jay-Z last summer , surprising fan with the nine-track collaborative effort “ Everything Is Love ” along the way . She ha not announced a follow-up .

 PHILADELPHIA — A sprinkler system check at a church that wa frequented by George Washington and Benjamin Franklin drew a crowd Wednesday , with dozen of people watching a sheet of water poured from the 196-foot ( 60-meter ) steeple .
 Christ Church leader breathed a sigh of relief at the sight : The system check showed that the church ha done all it can do to protect itself from a fire similar to the one that tore through Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris this week .
 `` One reason we did this wa to show symbolic solidarity with Notre Dame , '' said Barbara Hogue , executive director of the Christ Church preservation fund . `` But it 's also because we 're about to start renovation here , too , and we thought it wa really prudent to start by testing our fire system , to be sure that , in the event something happens , we were prepared . ''
 The landmark Christ Church wa founded in 1695 and ha been in continuous use ever since . Besides Washington and Franklin , it notable congregant included other signer of the Declaration of Independence and Betsy Ross . Visitors can sit in their centuries-old pew or marvel at a spire funded by a campaign launched by Franklin in the mid-1700s .
 The spire wa struck by lightning in 1908 , but the ensuing fire wa quickly quashed by rain . In the 1920s , church leader installed the first sprinkler system .
 Because the spire is slanting about 22 inch ( 56 centimeter ) off-center and there are other maintenance need , the church is in the midst of a $ 3.1 million capital campaign . It ha raised $ 2.5 million , which includes a $ 500,000 grant from the National Endowment of the Humanities .
 `` There 's always that point where there 's the difference between deferred maintenance and tragedy , '' Hogue said . `` We 're getting to the end of deferred maintenance and we really need to get this capital campaign going . ''
 Checking the church 's fire suppression system Wednesday wa part of the pre-renovation preparation , but church official had n't planned to make it a public event until the blaze at Notre Dame . The fire , which destroyed most of the 850-year-old cathedral 's roof and caused it 19th century spire to collapse , occurred while major renovation were underway . There wa no sprinkler system in place .
 `` Many of the press called and asked u , 'What happened at Notre Dame , could that happen here ? ' said the Rev . Mark Safford , noting this wa also a way for the church `` to demonstrate how the great building of Philadelphia are able to protect themselves from catastrophic fire . ''
 Tour guide Joseph Spurlock , of Free Tours By Foot , stopped his group of about 20 to watch the display .

 TEL AVIV , Israel — Last year , Shir Katzenell made a drastic life change , leaving a prestigious job in the Israeli army to pursue a childhood dream : becoming a mermaid .
 Ever since getting hooked on Disney 's `` The Little Mermaid '' a a kid , Katzenell confided , she ha longed to turn into one . While her friend moved on , Katzenell 's enchantment with mermaid endured . She fantasized about swimming underwater alongside fish in a 10-pound tail and sequined bikini . Then she actually gave it a try .
 As it turn out , she 's not the only one .
 Together with a friend and fellow mermaid-fan , Michelle Koretsky , she started an unlikely social scene : a group of aspiring mermaid in Israel , which ha grown on Facebook to nearly 1,000 member . It 's the Israeli pocket of a worldwide community that she claim is gaining prominence .
 `` It wa a crazy revelation , '' said Katzenell . `` I realized I wa part of something big . ''
 Now , a a 34-year-old `` full-time mermaid , '' she sell brightly-colored tail , some with dizzying $ 800 price tag , and teach people the skill of swimming in them .
 The tail-clad group convenes regularly to romp in public pool across the country and participate in demonstration to raise awareness about ocean preservation .
 `` Some come because they 're just interested or feel a special connection to the water . Others because they really dream of becoming mermaid , '' Katzenell said . `` They 've often been embarrassed , told they were weird or crazy . But here they can find people who understand them . ''
 On a recent night at a Tel Aviv pool , dozen of mermaid enthusiast slipped on their shimmering skin . Huddled on deck , they chatted about the latest development in mermaid culture , including `` The Little Mermaid '' remake release date , silicone tail cost and relevant book recommendation . They glided through the water and splashed around , their glittery tail slapping against the surface .
 One of the clan 's few mer-men , Yuval Avrami , marveled at how his fabric fin flitted in the water , describing it a a `` dream come true . '' He said he learned about the trend through transgender friend and became fascinated by `` the transition from one specie to another , the ability to inhabit a new , magical identity . ''
 Another member , an aerobics instructor named Udi Frige , said he had been swimming in the sea with his leg pressed together for decade , imitating mermaid choreography from the hit movie `` Splash . ''
 Frige , 39 , compared confessing his mermaid obsession to coming out in the LGBT community . `` It 's my thing , it 's unique , it 's who I am , '' he said . `` It requires lot of difficult explanation , especially if people do n't know me . ''
 For others , it 's just a source of innocent joy .
 `` When I 'm flying through the water with my tail , I forget all my worry , '' said Koretsky , the community co-leader . `` For that second , I 'm a child again . I 'm free . ''

 THE BIRD KING By G. Willow Wilson
 Readers who enjoy G. Willow Wilson ’ s “ Ms . Marvel ” comic ( a my 10-year-old son and I do ) know with what a deft , sympathetic hand she depicts her heroine , Kamala Khan , a superhero who by day is a teenage Muslim girl from Jersey City : four characteristic that can make people in her world and ours foolishly doubt her power . In Wilson ’ s new novel , “ The Bird King , ” she creates an equally appealing protagonist in Fatima , the favored concubine of the last sultan of Granada , whose emirate is about to fall to the Spanish .
 Fatima ’ s story begin in 1491 in Abu Abdullah ’ s court , just a an enemy delegation arrives . Her friend Hassan ha the ability to draw map of the unseen , including a map of Cádiz that show secret tunnel behind the Spanish line . Tipped off that the supposed “ emissary of peace ” is a representative of the Inquisition planning to seize Hassan a a sorcerer , he and Fatima escape from the palace . After stumbling into a netherworld called the Empty Quarter , where a mangy dog come to their aid in his true form a the jinni Vikram ( whom reader of Wilson ’ s novel “ Alif the Unseen ” may fondly recall ) , they head for the coast , inquisitor in hot pursuit .
 Fatima and Hassan have a choice : to flee across the Strait of Jebel Tareq ( Gibraltar ) to Morocco or to follow one of Hassan ’ s map to Qaf , the mystical isle of the Bird King , a described in the 12th-century poem “ The Conference of the Birds. ” Of course they choose to venture into the unknown , where they ’ re aided by a host of character including the jinni , his sister , a salty Breton monk and a gelding they lovingly call Stupid .
 An adept writer of historical fiction , Wilson relies le on period detail than on vivid , multisensory description . Fatima ’ s mistress at the court , Lady Aisha , bathe in a stone tub “ strewn with lavender bud and dried linden , which clung in sticky clump to the flesh of her calves. ” On the gorier side , when Vikram eats an enemy assailant , we hear “ the stony crunch of teeth through bone and another more unspeakable sound , the slip and hiss of viscera being separated from itself . ”
 “ The Bird King ” brilliantly reimagines the fall of Muslim Granada to the same superpower that prosecuted the Inquisition and colonized the Western Hemisphere . Although told from the point of view of a young woman considered chattel , it ’ s not merely a critique of imperialism or patriarchy . For one thing , it ’ s too funny . The same giddy humor that let Kamala Khan swoon over the smell of forbidden pork let Lady Aisha introduce Fatima to the Spanish delegation by saying : “ Please forgive her in advance for the many offense she is preparing to commit . I have never punished her for anything . There ’ s no point . ”
 A warm , generous spirit underlies the entire novel . When Fatima asks the sultan why he stare at an ancient map of his kingdom , he say , “ I tell myself that Al Andalus is still here , even if it extends no farther than the wall of this city . ”
 For an American Jewish reader like me , for whom the idea of Ashkenaz is historical or imaginary ( or both ) , this statement resonates , a it will for anyone who must reconcile the remembered and imagined past with the complexity and imperfection of the present . “ The Bird King ” maintains a delicate balance between holding Fatima ’ s world in high regard , looking at it critically and finding it moment of humor , all the while revealing it many resemblance to the world a it exists today .
 Emily Barton ’ s most recent novel is “ The Book of Esther . ”

 PARIS — In the Gothic magnificence of the Notre Dame Cathedral , Cecile Deleville found a refuge for her soul .
 It wa Notre Dame that nudged her back to religion , and it is Notre Dame that ha kept her there for 20 year . While tourist filed down the vaulted aisle , Deleville would sit in the front pew , her head bowed in prayer .
 So when the cathedral went up in flame in the midst of evening Mass on Monday , it hit Deleville especially hard .
 `` I feel lost . I have to rebuild my life now , '' she said , choking back tear . `` I have to find my parish . ''
 The landmark in the center of Paris , from where all distance in France are measured , wa the site of Napoleon 's coronation and survived the French Revolution and two world war , ringing out their victory .
 Today , it stand a the nation 's keeper , the spiritual heart of secular France .
 Notre Dame is n't a standard parish . Neither marriage nor baptism have been celebrated there in year . But for those who worshipped there , it wa most definitely their church .
 One of those wa Deleville , who at 66 is retired from her job helping the elderly .
 Born into a family of atheist , she converted to Catholicism at 21 . Her journey into faith wa n't seamless . She later grew disappointed with the church and found her way back year later , to Notre Dame .
 Despite living in Vincennes on Paris ' eastern edge , Deleville worshipped regularly , sometimes daily , at Notre Dame for two decade . It wa her place of prayer , her place of contemplation , her source of strength .
 She did n't know other parishioner , sharing only the ritual sign of peace during Mass . But for Deleville , Our Lady of Paris wa very much alive . She said there wa something mystical about the church , something she could n't explain .
 `` Since 1999 , I can say that if there is a place for me to take refuge , it is Notre Dame , '' she said . `` What I lived in Notre Dame I did n't live in other church — a rather exceptional experience . ''
 On Monday night , Deleville wa too distraught to visit the site of the raging fire . Photos of the iconic spire consumed by flame , then toppling , were too devastating , she said .
 `` It 's hard not to be emotional , '' Deleville said , her voice cracking and tear streaming down her cheek . `` For me , it 's Notre Dame . It 's not just stone . ''
 Some 24 hour later , she steeled herself and decided to take her first look .
 With a friend holding her arm , she walked the short distance from Saint Severin church to a small street with a view across the Seine River to the landmark .
 Her hand went to her mouth a the cathedral came into view .
 She gazed silently , her shock visible . Finally , she spoke .
 `` She wa so beautiful , '' Deleville marveled .
 She recalled the last time she took a photo of it from afar .
 `` There wa this amazing light with the sun setting , which made her shine , '' Deleville said . `` And now , the sky is sad . The sky is sad . ''
 Like others who worshipped at Notre Dame , Deleville need a new church . President Emmanuel Macron ha vowed to rebuild the cathedral in five year . Others say that 's overly ambitious .
 In the meantime , Deleville said she would probably go to Saint Severin .
 But do n't call her a parishioner , she said : `` I will come a a tourist . ''

 LIMA , Peru — In a Peruvian neighborhood where family consider running water a luxury , young girl are learning the delicate art of ballet dancing .
 In the classroom at a public school near the South American nation 's Pacific coast , girl line up at wooden ballet barres , point toe and curve arm .
 `` When I dance I forget about everything , '' 16-year-old Maria Cielo Cardenas said on a recent afternoon . `` It 's a if I were flying . ''
 The class led by Maria del Carmen Silva , a former professional dancer , is bringing classical ballet dancing to child from impoverished community where leotard and shiny pink pointe shoe are seldom , if ever , seen .
 The 52-year-old teacher say her mission is n't just to teach girl how to plié , but to prepare them for a future outside the boundary of their poor neighborhood . She take student to dance in Lima 's wealthiest district in the hope of building friendship between those who can and can not easily afford a new ballet costume .
 Later this year , Silva also hope to take them to Florida to participate in a dance competition , if she can raise enough money for plane ticket .
 `` Ballet is n't known because it 's so expensive , '' the former National Ballet of Peru dancer said . `` You need to buy costume , leotard and pointe shoe . ''
 Silva 's initiative ha sparked new dream in the mind of girl for whom dance , let alone international travel , long seemed like a distant possibility .
 On any given afternoon , excited parent peer through the studio 's window to watch their daughter practice to the sound of Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky 's `` Waltz of the Flowers . '' Many say they are experiencing ballet for the first time through their child .
 `` The only ballet we 'd heard about before wa the story of a dancing rat , '' said Elcira Ruiz , the mother of two daughter , referring to a child 's book series .
 Ruiz and her husband , who is nearly blind , attend all of their child 's performance . She record the girl dancing on her cell phone , and her husband later watch them by holding the screen close to his failing eye .
 Silva is convinced that the discipline required in ballet will teach life lesson to a group of student for whom hardship ha come at an early age .
 Three sister who dance together are living with their grandmother because their mother left to work in Spain and their father abandoned them .
 Cardenas frequently worry about her mother 's failing kidney , but say dance relief her stress .
 Peru is a country where seven million people live on just $ 105 a month . Despite the country 's economic stability , it ha one of the region 's lowest rate of investment in education . All of that mean ballet is usually for the rich .
 While some wealthier parent have balked at Silva 's initiative though , most have embraced it .
 For Cardenas , the chance to practice in the upscale district of Miraflores is like taking a step into a new world . She love walking through the neighborhood 's leafy street , and she marvel at simple thing like running water , which she doe not have in her own home .
 `` When I entered four year ago , I felt uncomfortable , '' she said of dancing with girl from entirely different background . `` Now we are classmate , like sister . ''

 The new policy , which doe not apply to Disney park in France , China and Japan , wa greeted with widespread praise .

 The smoking ban will “ ratchet up the bar for the industry , ” he added . “ Other park operator will follow suit . ”
 A spokeswoman for Cedar Fair Parks , which owns and operates about a dozen amusement park across the country , said she wa “ not aware of any plan for an all-out smoking ban ” by her organization . A representative from Six Flags Great Adventure did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
 On Thursday , a visitor in a soon-to-be extinct smoking area in Florida ’ s Magic Kingdom Park wa not pleased .

 After debuting a surprisingly funny trailer at Comic-Con International last summer , DC ’ s superhero origin story return with an equally amusing follow-up . “ Superpowers ? Dude , I don ’ t even know how to pee in this thing ! ” the caped crime-fighter ( Zachary Levi ) tell his pal . So what if he can ’ t quite leap a tall building in a single bound ?
 The new shocker from “ Hereditary ” director Ari Aster unfolds at a nine-day outdoor gathering that take place every 90 year in rural Sweden and quickly turn horrific .

 SALEM , Ore. — Rose Marie Bentley wa an avid swimmer , raised five kid , helped her husband run a feed store , and lived to the ripe age of 99 . It wa only after she died that medical student discovered that all her internal organ — except for her heart — were in the wrong place .
 The discovery of the rare condition , which wa presented this week to a conference of anatomist , wa astounding — especially because Bentley had lived so long . People with the condition known a situs inversus with levocardia often have life-threatening cardiac ailment and other abnormality , according to Oregon Health & Science University .
 Cameron Walker 's class at the university in Portland wa examining the heart of a cadaver last year when they noticed the blood vessel were different . When they opened the abdominal cavity , they saw that all the other organ were on the wrong side . The unusual blood vessel helped the heart compensate .
 In a telephone interview Tuesday , Walker described his reaction to the find a `` definitely a mix of curiosity , fascination and a sense of wanting to explore a little bit of a medical mystery — a medical marvel really — that wa in front of u . ''
 `` And I would say the student felt something very similar , '' Walker , an assistant professor of anatomy , told The Associated Press .
 Bentley 's family had not known about the condition , which OHSU say occurs only once in every 22,000 birth . Apparently Bentley did n't either .
 Bentley , who lived in Molalla , 25 mile ( 40 kilometer ) south of Portland , had led a normal life . Her only recurrent physical complaint wa arthritis , her daughter Louise Allee remembered .
 But there were sign .
 When Bentley wa in her 50 , she underwent a hysterectomy , and the doctor also wanted to remove the appendix . But he could n't find it , Allee said in a phone interview .
 When Bentley had her gallbladder removed at least a decade later , it wa on the opposite side of where it should have been , she said .
 `` No one said a thing , '' Allee said . `` I wa surprised . This wa before they did it with a scope , and she had a good-sized incision . You 'd think they would have said something , but they did n't . ''
 Bentley had agreed to donate her body to OHSU , Oregon 's only academic health center .
 `` This is an important case that really gave u an opportunity to talk about the importance of future clinician paying attention to subtle anatomic variation , not just large anatomic variation , in term of addressing their future patient a individual , '' Walker said . `` Do n't judge a book by it cover , and always check and see what you 've got before you talk about care . ''
 He ha researched how long people with the condition have lived , and he found no documented case in which a person lived beyond age 73 . Bentley surpassed that by 26 year .
 Allee said her mother would have been delighted that the donation of her body led to a learning experience .
 `` She would have been tickled to know she could educate with something unusual , '' Allee said . `` Dad would have loved to know about it so he could tease her . ''
 Her husband , James , died about 15 year ago .

 The winner had until April 19 to claim the money .
 Winning the lottery come with a long list of difficult decision , which may explain the delay in making the claim . Thus far , the winner ha followed the typical playbook to minimize or avoid potential complication : The person ha stayed anonymous , and ha gotten help .

 “ It ’ s natural there ’ s going to be a strain , ” Mr. Kurland said . “ It depends on how strong your relationship are before the lottery . If you ’ re really close with someone and they feel they deserve a gift , it ’ s really difficult . It ’ s one of the thing winner are freaked out about when they come to me . ”
 The winner wa fortunate to be a resident of South Carolina , one of a handful of state where winner are allowed to remain anonymous . In other state , winner have to sit through a news conference , and the publicity can attract all variety of vulture who would look to take advantage .

 It wa a rarity for “ Saturday Night Live ” this weekend : an opening sketch that had absolutely nothing to do with President Trump or politics .
 Instead , the show sent up the much talked about sit-down between the “ CBS This Morning ” host Gayle King and the singer R. Kelly , who ha been charged with 10 count of aggravated criminal sexual abuse involving four woman , three of whom were underage at the time . Leslie Jones played King while Kenan Thompson portrayed Kelly , who repeatedly asked Jones to call him “ Victim. ” She declined .
 Thompson voiced multiple aside in the style of Kelly ’ s “ Trapped in the Closet ” series and told Jones that he had “ more than million of dollar : thousand . ”
 When asked about the recent Lifetime documentary series “ Surviving R. Kelly , ” in which many of the alleged abuse where recounted , Thompson said : “ They made it seem like I wa the Devil . I ’ m not the Devil . and even if I wa , you can ’ t think of one nice thing to say about the Devil ? I can . Nice horn . Gives good advice . ”
 The sketch also went on to parody the moment when Kelly came unglued and got out of his chair during the CBS interview . But first , the singer seemed confused about whether the interview had even started . He didn ’ t recognize the camera directly in front of him .
 “ You all just keep your camera out in the open like that ? ” Thompson asked . “ You all are some freak . ”
 Asked directly if he had ever held woman against their will , Thompson said : “ O.K . guy , think for a minute . Use your brain . Why would I do these thing ? For 30 year . I gave you all ‘ Trapped in the Closet. ’ ‘ Feelin ’ on Yo ’ Booty. ’ ‘ Age Ain ’ t Nothing but a Number. ’ And so many other clue . ”
 The standout sketch this week took aim at uproar over Hollywood casting decision , spurred by social medium mob . The parody came in the form of a game show hosted by Thompson called “ Can I Play That ? ” — “ actor ’ least favorite game . ”
 The game featured three contestant , played by this week ’ s host , Idris Elba , and by Beck Bennett and Cecily Strong , each of whom portrayed working actor asked to give their best guess a to who wa allowed to play certain role .
 Thompson started by asking contestant about a recent real-life example : Will Smith ’ s casting a Richard Williams , the father of Venus and Serena Williams . Some have criticized the choice , arguing that Smith is too light-skinned to play Richard Williams . Can he play that ?
 Bennett hit the buzzer first : “ Yes , of course , he ’ ll do a great job , ” he said .
 He wa wrong . Strong buzzed in with the right answer : “ Absolutely not , he ’ s not black enough . ”
 Responding to Elba , who asked if this wa real , Thompson said : “ It sure is . Because this game is produced by Twitter . Twitter : One mistake , and we ’ ll kill you . ”
 The rest of the sketch followed along the same line . Elba ’ s character wa told he wa not allowed to play a blind person .
 “ Isn ’ t that what acting is about ? ” Elba asked . “ You know , becoming someone you ’ re not ? ”
 “ Not anymore , no. ” Thompson replied . “ Now it ’ s about becoming yourself but with a different haircut . ”
 By the end of the sketch , it wa decided that no one could play Caitlyn Jenner in a biopic and that Rami Malek could play anyone he wanted . In a lightning round , Bennett guessed correctly that a white male like him could play “ a white guy , a white guy who gained 50 pound , slave owner , and that ’ s it . ”
 This week , Colin Jost and Michael Che kicked off “ Weekend Update ” by taking on the sentencing of Paul Manafort , Trump ’ s former campaign chairman who wa sentenced to le than four year in one of the two case against him , well below the sentencing guideline .
 Jost :
 O.K. , here ’ s how bad Trump ’ s presidency is going . His campaign manager this week wa sentenced to four year in prison , and for Trump , that ’ s good news . Paul Manafort , who look like he wa born divorced , faced up to 24 year in prison but only got four year , probably in a minimum security white collar facility with a bunch of his friend . The guy stole over $ 50 million and he basically got sentenced to college .
 Che later added :
 Paul Manafort got 47 month for tax evasion and bank fraud , which , a a black guy , feel very unfair . But for a rich black guy , it ’ s a little encouraging . I mean if I could steal million of dollar and the United States presidency in exchange for , like , three year of prison in my 70 ? I can ’ t promise I won ’ t try .
 Jost went on to riff about a photo published Friday in the Miami Herald of Trump ’ s Super Bowl party at his country club in West Palm Beach :
 It wa reported that President Trump watched the Super Bowl at Mar-a-Lago with Li Yang , the woman who founded the chain of Asian day spa where Patriots owner Robert Kraft allegedly solicited a prostitute . First of all , what a time to be alive , huh ? Second , you know that Trump spent all their time together trying to convince her to give up North Korea ’ s nuclear weapon .
 Che then dug into Trump regarding his Friday visit to Alabama in the wake of several deadly tornado there , which have killed at least 23 people :
 President Trump visited tornado victim in Alabama and signed bible for them . Now , I don ’ t know , man . I ’ m not a very religious guy , but I feel like when you ’ re getting your bible signed by a dude that raw dog porn star , you ’ re probably not a very religious guy either .
 “ S.N.L. ” love a good celebrity cameo , and this week it wa Gwyneth Paltrow , who wa brought onto Weekend Update to mock her own lifestyle company , Goop .
 The bit started innocently enough a Che invited a Goop staffer , played by Heidi Gardner , to discus the company ’ s recent wellness summit . She presented a Goop body wash , which wa made with ginger and something called ashwagandha . Unfortunately , she couldn ’ t properly describe what ashwagandha wa , so she brought on her supervisor , Pfeiffer , played by Paltrow herself .
 When Gardner expressed the worry that she would be fired , Paltrow-as-Pfeiffer reassured her that the real-life Paltrow didn ’ t believe in firing : “ Remember , it ’ s called conscious unemploying . ”
 Perhaps tied to the release of “ Captain Marvel , ” “ S.N.L. ” tried a Marvel parody of it own with a version of “ The Incredible Hulk ” titled “ The Impossible Hulk , ” in which Elba played Bruce Banner . In this case , however , instead of turning into a supersized green monster when he got angry , Banner morphed into an “ emboldened white lady . ”
 The enjoyable short featured Strong turning the self-entitlement up to the maximum while harassing neighbor having a party , exploding at a police officer during a traffic stop , and losing it at a cashier trying to enforce a store credit policy .

 ( Reuters ) - Netflix Inc gave a weak forecast on Tuesday that unnerved investor just a Walt Disney Co and others prepare to escalate Hollywood 's streaming video war , although the company 's quarterly result beat Wall Street target .
 Shares of Netflix traded down about 1 percent at $ 355.02 in after-the-bell trading .
 Netflix predicted it would pick up 5 million new streaming subscriber from April through June . That wa below the 5.48 million consensus of industry analyst surveyed by FactSet .
 `` What 's making investor nervous is that there are sign of a slowdown in the second-quarter subscriber growth , '' said Haris Anwar , senior analyst at Investing.com . `` This is made all the more prominent by the looming threat of competition from Disney and Apple . ''
 Netflix added a record number of paid streaming customer in the first quarter , reaching a total of 148.86 million .
 The just-ended first quarter included the debut of original drama `` Sex Education '' and `` Russian Doll , '' and the company raised price in the United States , Mexico and Brazil .
 In a letter to shareholder , Netflix said it saw `` some modest short-term churn effect , '' or dropping of it service , in response to the price increase .
 From January through March , Netflix reported it added 7.86 million paid subscriber internationally , compared with the average analyst estimate of 7.14 million , according to IBES data from Refinitiv .
 The company said it signed up 1.74 million paid subscriber in the United States in the quarter , above the average analyst estimate of about 1.57 million , according to IBES data from Refinitiv .
 Netflix is spending billion to attract new customer while Disney and Apple Inc build streaming rival and Amazon.com Inc make gain with audience .
 `` With a combined market cap of around $ 2.2 trillion , those three bruiser are n't to be messed with , '' Hargreaves Lansdown equity analyst George Salmon said .
 Disney is viewed a one of Netflix 's strongest rival thanks to a broad portfolio of franchise popular with child - from Mickey Mouse to Marvel and Star Wars - and a brand trusted by parent . Last week , Disney priced it service at $ 7 per month , just over half the $ 13 price for Netflix 's most U.S. popular plan . The Disney+ service will launch in November .
 `` We do n't anticipate that these new entrant will materially affect our growth , '' Netflix said , `` because the transition from linear to on-demand entertainment is so massive and because of the different nature of our content offering . `` Disney is leading a shift among traditional medium company that had been selling programming to Netflix for year . Now , many have decided to keep their content for their own service . AT & T Inc 's WarnerMedia and Comcast Corp plan to move into the streaming market .
 Netflix spent $ 7.5 billion on TV show and movie for 2018 , and executive have said that amount will grow in 2019 . The aggressive spending ha led to a tripling of the company 's debt in two year , to $ 10.36 billion in 2018 , from $ 3.36 billion in 2016 .
 For the first quarter , Netflix said it net income rose to $ 344.1 million , or 76 cent per share , from $ 290.1 million , or 64 cent per share , a year earlier . Analysts on average were expecting 57 cent per share .
 Total revenue rose to $ 4.52 billion from $ 3.70 billion . Analysts on average had expected revenue of $ 4.50 billion .
 Netflix share had closed up 3 percent in regular Nasdaq trading on Tuesday ahead of the result .

 These servicewomen are leader , pioneer , change-makers and survivor . Here ’ s what their family member have to say about them .
 By Lauren Katzenberg
 Want the At War newsletter emailed to you ? Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox every Friday .
 The Times recently asked servicewomen and veteran to share story about their military service for a project planned for today , International Women ’ s Day . I wasn ’ t surprised that we received more than 650 submission to our reader call-out . But reading the dozen of account that poured in each day filled me with a renewed sense of appreciation and frustration for these woman ’ s service . Too many had to force their way into an institution that ha been designed for and upheld by men for generation . Too many were told they didn ’ t belong . And too many felt the physical and mental consequence of disrupting and threatening the male-dominated status quo in way that should have been punishable — and yet were repeatedly ignored by senior military leader .
 This collection of story is both a celebration of woman ’ s military service and a reckoning of what they ’ ve endured . It ’ s also a recognition that the military still ha a long way to go before we see any real resemblance of gender equality . As Capt . Ja ’ Mia Rowland wrote : “ I have become accustomed to being the only person in the room who look like me. ” You can read her story and 39 others here .
 The Times also asked reader with a woman in their family who serf or served to tell u about that person . Here is a selection of those response .
 Jill Hardy , Temecula , Calif .
 My mother , Doris Van Meter Peterson , will be 100 this year . She joined the Marine Corps at the beginning of World War II and wa the face of female Marines — she wa instrumental in getting woman to join . She met my father , Clifford O. Peterson Sr. , while stationed in Atlanta , in 1944 . She still life in the home she shared with my father . She is an amazing woman who volunteered at a hospital in Redding , Calif. , until four year ago . She only had to stop because she had fallen and broken a hip — while sweeping the front step . Backward !
 Randi Mahoney , New Boston , Mich .
 My mother , Amy Hodge , wa attached to the 10th Mountain Division out of Fort Drum in New York , during which time she deployed to Mogadishu , Somalia . She told me that while there she pulled over 300 dead body out of a river that were contaminating the local drinking water ; she wa involved in firefights ; she held a friend while he died . The biggest challenge I ’ ve seen my mom face is the lack of recognition that she even served . When she walk into any veteran event or local post , she is instantly written off a a wife , and her story and experience are ignored , even though nine time out of 10 she is the most badass person in the room .
 Dr. Anne Harrington , Hurlburt Field , Fla .
 My wife , Col. Brenda Cartier , is the first female senior military leader in Air Force Special Operations and one of the first woman to fly and command Special Operations combat mission . Brenda flew the AC-130 gunship , one of the deadliest aircraft in the Air Force . In 2003 she wa in a gunship overhead during the rescue of Pfc . Jessica Lynch , the first successful P.O.W . rescue since World War II . Brenda is an amazing spouse and role model to L.G.B.T . airman . We actually get stopped in public by young people who recognize her and thank her for being so out and open about who she is .
 Capt . William Salvin , Dripping Springs , Tex .
 I ’ m a captain in the Navy Reserve . My daughter , Paige Skinner , is a public affair officer in the Air Force . When she wa commissioned , I wanted to give her advice , but I knew that my experience a a man in the military would be vastly different from hers . I sent a note to the amazing woman with whom I served over the year , put together a book of advice from them and gave it to my daughter .

 Oscars night come at the end of a five-month marathon of fasting and training and dressing up a Dream Date Barbie ( or Ken ) again and again , each event bringing the star a bit closer to summiting the Everest that is award season . “ The end is in sight , ” said Elizabeth Saltzman , a celebrity stylist best known for her adventurous work with Saoirse Ronan , in an interview ahead of the show . “ You ’ ve climbed the mountain and you can see the peak . ”
 First , though , there is the Death Zone ( or , a E ! call it , the Glambot ) . A treacherous traverse in the day of Joan Rivers spilling out her meanie opinion , the red carpet ha been unexpectedly transformed lately — vaguely in tandem with the entertainment industry itself — into a surprisingly diverse and welcoming place .
 In the internet era , Ms. Saltzman said , everyone may be a critic . Yet an overdue tonal shift ha taken hold at the Oscars , one that dial down the negative voice , possibly in recognition of adjustment that took decade to achieve . “ Things have changed with the # MeToo moment , ” said Karla Welch , another seasoned Hollywood stylist . “ There ’ s a lot more freedom , a lot more politics in the styling . It ’ s not only about the money or the glamour of the dress . ”

 It is about the “ Pose ” star Billy Porter flouting gender binary by wearing a Christian Siriano tuxedo dress . It is about Melissa McCarthy offering a visual rebuke to any body-shamers in a chic black and white pantsuit with a cape . It is about the “ Roma ” star Yalitza Aparicio demonstrating with her presence , in an elegant one-shoulder dress , the shifting perception in Mexico about the country ’ s large indigenous population , difficult to imagine even five year ago a wa her appearance wa on the cover of Vogue Mexico . ( Ms. Aparicio , it is worth remembering , once applied for a job at a clothing store in Tlaxiaco , Oaxaca , her hometown , and wa turned away because of the color of her skin . ) It is about Awkwafina , the Queens-born actor and rapper , in a metallic Dsquared2 pantsuit that wa a long way from the B-girl look she affected for a music video about powerful woman .
 It is about Spike Lee wearing a purple suit from the British tailor Ozwald Boateng , which he topped off with a custom motorcycle cap inspired by one he spotted in Paris on the architect Peter Marino and accessorized with a diamond , gold and fire opal necklace inspired by Prince ’ s love symbol , made by the Neapolitan jeweler Amedeo Scognamiglio .
 “ A man in a high-jewelry necklace is a first , ” said an astonished Mr. Scognamiglio . “ Plus , he commissioned it and paid for it , which is the distinction and elegance of Spike Lee , ” the jeweler added , referring to the complex bargaining game celebrity play with those who supply their clothes .
 “ Spike Lee just walked in and he look cold ! ” the actress Amandla Stenberg told a red carpet reporter . “ He look dope . ”
 An Oscars where people look cold and dope is a revitalized Oscars . Never mind that this change ha occurred at a time when the award show is suffering diminished rating and a general loss of cultural traction . There remains much to celebrate not only in the ethereal vision of Laura Harrier , the “ BlacKkKlansman ” actress , in a Louis Vuitton beaded silk dress by Nicolas Ghesquière , but in the fact that a Hollywood star is at pain to note that every element of her outfit had been sustainably sourced .
 It ’ s not likely that the same could be said of the metallic confection Wes Gordon of Carolina Herrera designed for Glenn Close to wear if — after seven nomination — she finally managed to clinch an Oscar . A dress that conjured something Stan Lee might have come up with , if only Marvel had ever devised a septuagenarian woman superhero , it even had a train and a cape .
 “ It ’ s got four million bead , ” Ms. Close said of a dress fully in line with traditional maximalist Hollywood dressing . “ And it weighs 42 pound . ”

 • Futbolistas colombianas reclaman por discriminación y ponen en foco denuncias por acoso sexual . Las jugadoras han desatado un movimiento y un necesario ajuste de cuentas con la Federación Colombiana de Fútbol ( Colfútbol ) : con la consigna de “ Menos miedo , más fútbol ” , do jugadoras de la seleccción mayor exigieron respuesta a sus acusaciones de discriminación por los malos tratos y la falta constante de apoyo . Esta situación animó a que se difundieran públicamente do denuncias sobre acoso sexual en la selección sub-17 y llevó a la FIFA , la CONMEBOL y la selección varonil a condenar públicamente cualquier posible instancia de acoso sexual y laboral .
 La situación de la deportistas sale a la luz después de que el gobierno colombiano anunciara su intención de competir para ser sede del Mundial Femenil de 2023 . El año pasado , durante un debate en el congreso , un exfuncionario señaló que la impunidad en casos de violencia contra la mujeres ronda el 90 por ciento en el país . “ Creyeron que podían callar a la jugadoras , pero no pudieron ” , dice una de la mujeres que denunció el acoso .
 • Nuevas polémicas en Guatemala y El Salvador por proyectos de amnistía para delitos de lesa humanidad . El congreso guatemalteco está avanzando una reforma a la Ley de Reconciliación Nacional con la cual crecería la lista de delitos cometidos durante la guerra civil que pueden ser amnistiados : sería posible quedar libre de condenas por casos de genocidio , desaparición forzada y tortura . Con ello , la mayoría de la sentencias ya dictadas quedarían sin efecto .
 En El Salvador también hay un proyecto legislativo para recuperar la Ley de Amnistía General de 1993 , que fue declarada inconstitucional hace tres años por la Corte Suprema . Esta emplazó a la asamblea legislativa salvadoreña a redactar una nueva ley con garantías de reparaciones a víctimas y de no repetición , pero la propuesta que discute una comisión impediría enjuiciar delitos cometidos durante la guerra civil . El borrador fue criticado por el Comité de Derechos Humanos de la ONU .
 • Un nuevo debate sobre el uso de herbicidas para fumigar plantaciones de coca . La Corte Constitucional de Colombia realizó ayer audiencias con funcionarios para discutir si permite nuevamente hacer fumigaciones con glifosato , herbicida cuyo uso fue suspendido en 2015 por reportes de que podría ser cancerígeno . En la audiencia , el presidente Iván Duque urgió a que se retome este método como herramienta contra “ la amenaza y los riesgos ” al país por “ el crecimiento vertiginoso en los últimos años de los cultivos ilícitos ” . La corte determinará en los siguientes me si mantiene la restricciones .
 “ Esto e lo que me gustaría que mi hija vea hoy : que el nuestro no e un bloque uniforme de gente , que lo que no une a veces e lo que no separa y esa no e una mala noticia , porque la diversidad no le resta potencia a nuestro reclamo de ser vista , de que nuestras vox sean escuchadas ” .
 Antes de acudir hoy a la marchas por el Día Internacional de la Mujer , Gabriela Wiener , escritora y periodista peruana , reflexiona sobre cómo la jornada e una ocasión para reclamar , pero también para celebrar que la categoría de “ mujer ” no e homogénea .
 Esta pintura de acuarela común y corriente sería justamente eso , si no fuera por un detalle : está firmada “ A . Hitler ” y eso la vuelve negocio . Hace poco fue adquirida después de una subasta , pero queda la duda : más allá de la cuestión moral de comprar arte mediocre solo porque la habría pintado el dictador alemán ante de llegar al poder , ¿qué sucede si la obra e una falsificación ?
 • Rusia penaliza a quienes hagan comentarios negativos sobre el gobierno en internet . La Cámara Baja rusa aprobó ayer medidas que castigarían con hasta quince días de arresto administrativo a cualquier persona que insulte al gobierno en redes sociales [ en inglés ] , además de que forzarían a sitios web a retirar contenido “ irrespetuoso ” contra el Estado y sus símbolos o que tenga “ información falsa con relevancia pública ” ( sin especificar qué se consideraría falso ) . Activistas denunciaron que estas medidas , que aún deben ser ratificadas por la Cámara Alta ( Duma ) , servirán como leyes mordaza arbitrarias .
 • Cortes y tasajos , una pérdida más del brexit . En medio de la discusiones sobre el futuro del Reino Unido , a veintiún días de que se consolide su salida de la Unión Europea y de su sistema aduanal , ha surgido un dilema : ¿qué sucede con la carne ? El problema de los avicultores británicos , que suelen exportar carne oscura e importar carne blanca , e indicativo del caos que se prevé para toda la industrias y del temor entre consumidores de quedarse sin alimentos . ( Algunos incluso están almacenando Spam , alimento enlatado que data de la Segunda Guerra Mundial y que dio nombre al correo indeseado tras ser inmortalizado por Monty Python ) .
 • Dale tu cuerpo a la ciencia y ayuda a resolver crímenes después de morir . El programa de justicia criminal de la Universidad de Tennessee , el primero de Estados Unidos enfocado en reunir restos humanos para su estudio forense , ofrece a los interesados donar sus cadáveres para los criminólogos en formación . La escritora Fawn Fitter se apuntó como donadora ; esto e lo que vio de la “ vida ” en la Granja de los Cuerpos .
 • Una vez más : vacunar a niños no causa autismo . Unicef alertó hace unos días que han aumentado de manera alarmante los casos y contagios de sarampión en todo el mundo . Posiblemente se debe a la creciente reticencia de ciertos padre de vacunar a sus hijos por el mito de que eso causa autismo ; aquí tenemos la cifras y datos que desmienten esa creencia .
 Andrew Rannells , actor conocido por la serie Girls y nominado al Tony por el musical Book of Mormon , no cuenta en este ensayo cómo lo que pensó iba a ser una noche de sexo casual cambió por completo por una llamada familiar que nadie quiere recibir .
 Unos me después , Rannells conoció a quien sería su pareja por varios años , pero descubrió que no e sencillo mantener una relación cuando ambo son rivales en el ámbito profesional .

 This year ’ s Oscars are finally over , so it ’ s time to move on to … next year ’ s Oscars . An early peek at a film that ’ s expected to be a contender lead the lineup of this week ’ s best and worst trailer .
 Netflix didn ’ t even wait for this year ’ s Academy Awards telecast to finish before rolling out a teaser for the director Martin Scorsese ’ s much-vaunted return to the mob genre , which reunites him with “ Goodfellas ” alum Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci and team him for the first time with “ The Godfather ” veteran Al Pacino . The 45-second spot feature zero footage , only a few snippet of cryptic dialogue ( including “ I hear you paint house , ” not coincidentally the title of the book that inspired the film ) . A spinning bullet casing cleverly form the ‘ i ’ in the name of the filmmaker and his cast , which also feature another frequent Scorsese collaborator , Harvey Keitel ( “ Mean Streets ” ) . The promo end with the word “ In Theaters This Fall , ” perhaps indicating a wider big-screen release than the one that may have hobbled “ Roma ” in it best picture race against “ Green Book . ”
 The second trailer for the latest installment in the “ X-Men ” franchise give off a serious “ Venom ” vibe , a young Jean Grey ( Sophie Turner ) grapple with an alien force inside her that cause her to wreak havoc . It ’ s up to her fellow mutant to help rid her of this cataclysmic force — without taking her life in the process . O.K. , Magneto ( Michael Fassbender ) wouldn ’ t mind killing her , but Professor X ( James McAvoy ) and the rest of the gang seem to be on the side of saving her . This exhilarating clip tap into the dark side of the female-empowerment theme that will be explored this month in “ Captain Marvel . ”
 Not to be confused with the actual Steve McQueen biopic “ Chasing Bullitt ” ( due March 5 ) , this fact-based heist thriller follows a Bullitt wannabe ( Travis Fimmel , formerly of TV ’ s “ Vikings ” ) who lead a ragtag band of thief on a job to steal $ 30 million in illegal campaign contribution to Richard M. Nixon ’ s 1972 re-election fund . The trailer for this crime dramedy from the director Mark Steven Johnson ( “ Ghost Rider ” ) owes a whopping debt to Quentin Tarantino , but it is a treat to see such an array of fine character actor , like William Fichtner , Forest Whitaker , Rhys Coiro and Louis Lombardi .
 After a confusing initial trailer released in November , the live-action/animation hybrid return with a follow-up promo that explains the film ’ s premise a bit more clearly . The titular pocket-monster P.I. , voiced by Ryan Reynolds , wake up with amnesia and seek out his missing partner ’ s son ( Justice Smith ) to figure out … wait , I got confused again . A film noir spoof with both human and inhuman character , this could be the next “ Who Framed Roger Rabbit ” — or the next “ Happytime Murders. ” Either way , it ’ s a mystery to me .

 Jo Andres , a visual artist whose experimental choreography performed at club in downtown Manhattan and evocative short film were imbued with fantastical and dreamlike imagery , died on Jan. 6 at her home in Brooklyn . She wa 64 .
 Her husband , the actor Steve Buscemi , said the cause wa encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis , which is characterized by intestinal blockage . She had also been treated for ovarian cancer .
 When Ms. Andres arrived in New York from Ohio in the early 1980s , she began to develop choreography that immersed the audience in a more sensually enriching experience than simply watching dancer , like herself , performing onstage .
 “ We had all studied modern dance and dance composition , ” Lucy Sexton , who attended Ohio University with Ms. Andres and performed with her , said in a telephone interview . “ But when we came to New York , we were performing in nightclub and punk-rock club , so her dance wedded two tradition : modern dance and performance art . ”
 To achieve her goal , Ms. Andres used a multimedia strategy . She used slide ( of stick figure , bone , skull and abstract shape she had drawn or painted ) and film ( on which she scratched line that swirled around the performer in them ) and then projected the image onto her dancer a they moved to music and manipulated wispy tulle .
 The image themselves seemed to dance a the performer moved the tulle around the stage , Ms. Sexton said . Layers of different-colored tulle made the image appear to reverberate in a holographic effect .
 “ Marvel followed marvel in ‘ Dreaming Out Loud , ’ ” the New York Times dance critic Jack Anderson wrote in 1990 . “ The production wa dominated by film projected on three screen . Cinematic image appeared and vanished . Upside-down face rippled on the screen like reflection in water , then were swallowed up by a void . Bodies seemed to float weightless in space . ”
 Ms. Andres said she had hoped to create a “ mood thing ” by mixing dance with film and slide .
 “ For me , ” she told The Los Angeles Times in 1988 , “ it is more interesting to change the flatness of film — to make it kind of 3-D and to make light dance — and to make the dancing look le dimensional , more compressed , like picture , mysterious symbol , where the light bend and shift , than to work with just the human form . ”
 Mary Jo Andres wa born on May 21 , 1954 , in Wichita , Kan. , and moved with her family to Hilliard , Ohio , a suburb of Columbus , when she wa 2 year old . Her father , Martin , wa a professor of veterinary medicine at Ohio State University ; her mother , Rosemarie ( Caiaccia ) Andres , wa a home economics teacher .
 Growing up in what she called a “ dark and scary ” emotional environment , Ms. Andres , to her parent ’ dismay , painted her bedroom in shade of yellow and orange that reminded her of the sun , she told Jung Journal , a quarterly publication about culture and psychology , in 2012 . Her parent began introducing her a their “ creative child , ” she said .
 “ I wa embarrassed because I knew that wasn ’ t really a good thing , ” she said . “ My parent didn ’ t quite know what to do with my creativity , but it ’ s interesting that they allowed it . ”
 She began dancing in high school — which did not impress her parent , who she said believed dance wa an exhibitionistic art that would expose her to “ weirdo ” — and sneaked away for private lesson , which she paid for through a job at a pharmacy .
 She graduated from Ohio University , in Athens , with a bachelor ’ s degree in dance , and later earned a master ’ s in film there .
 By the early 1990s , Ms. Andres had largely stopped working a a choreographer , although she directed a dance number in “ The Impostors , ” a 1998 film directed and starring Stanley Tucci ; instead she turned to making short film .
 One of them , “ Black Kites ” ( 1996 ) , adapted portion of a diary written by the visual artist Izeta Gradevic while she wa hiding from sniper and mortar in the basement of an abandoned theater during the siege of Sarajevo in 1992 , early in the Bosnian war . Ms. Andres — who shot the film in her basement in Brooklyn with role played by Mr. Buscemi and their son , Lucian — mixed surreal imagery with dramatic scene to convey the terror and hope recorded by Ms. Gradevic .
 “ I describe my aesthetic style a ‘ perceptual mischief , ’ ” Ms. Andres said in an interview with the International Forum of New Cinema in 1997 , when “ Black Kites ” wa shown at the Berlin International Film Festival .
 Ms. Gradevic , now the creative director of the Sarajevo Film Festival , wrote in an email that Ms. Andres ’ s film illustrated the pain of her wartime experience “ and the absurdity of our capacity to dream in the most unimaginable situation . ”
 Film and dance were not Ms. Andres ’ s only artistic endeavor : She also painted and created cyanotypes , using a 19th-century photographic process to produce eerie , nightmarish deep-blue image .
 In addition to her husband and son , Ms. Andres is survived by her brother , Tim , Pat and Mike , and a sister , Dayna Andres Harp .
 Ms. Andres ’ s friendship with the jazz singer Diana Krall led her to direct a film of Ms. Krall performing “ When the Curtain Comes Down , ” with Mr. Buscemi a a carnival barker and song-and-dance man . It served a the overture to Ms. Krall ’ s performance of vaudeville song during her “ Glad Rag Doll ” tour in 2012 and 2013 .
 “ We had such an intuitive relationship with each other , ” Ms. Krall said of Ms. Andres in a telephone interview . “ I said , ‘ Do the film , a you ’ d like , ’ and when I saw it , I said , ‘ This is exactly what I want. ’ She understood Magritte , silent movie and Stan Laurel — there are element of all of them in it . And her choreography of Steve , and his body language , are amazing . She captured all this in a piece that had empathy , humor and darkness . ”

 Dozens of Manhattan journalist gave themselves a big hug last Thursday night , when The Hollywood Reporter celebrated it annual list of “ 35 Most Powerful People in Media . ”
 Surely it just wa coincidence , and not a reference to the legend of Narcissus , that the party wa held at the Pool in Midtown Manhattan .
 The elite club included Gayle King , Savannah Guthrie , Craig Melvin , Hoda Kotb , Trevor Noah , Michael Strahan , Sunny Hostin , Jeff Glor , Lawrence O ’ Donnell , Samantha Bee and David Remnick .
 “ It ’ s always nice to be recognized by your peer , ” said Ms. King , who volunteered that she wa wearing “ two pair of Spanx ” beneath her Roland Mouret dress . “ Power mean responsibility , and I never take that lightly . ”
 When Sara Haines , a host on “ Good Morning America , ” ran into her rival from the “ Today ” show on the red carpet , a frenzy of air kissing ensued , a if someone had sprinkled fish food into an aquarium .
 After the carpet , presiding on a folding chair atop the stair , wa Cindy Adams , the longtime gossip columnist at The New York Post . Chris Cuomo , the CNN anchor , knelt to bus her topaz earring .
 “ Power mean relevance in the moment , which is very fleeting in the medium , ” Mr. Cuomo said . “ So make the most of it while you have it . ”
 There were some famous non-media type too , including Brooke Shields , Naomi Watts , Keegan-Michael Key , Christine Baranski , Cynthia Rowley and John Varvatos .
 So what doe it take to be anointed to the list ? Some lobbying doesn ’ t hurt .
 “ Last year at this party , Joy Behar came up to me and said , ‘ You ’ re insane , “ The View ” should be on this list , ’ ’ ’ said Matthew Belloni , the editorial director of The Hollywood Reporter . “ We looked at it , and it is a must-stop for all the presidential candidate , it is a news driver , and they are the leader in their category . So , they made the list this year , and Joy can thank her pushiness . ”
 And in the ultimate power move , having made the list , Ms. Behar didn ’ t show up to the party .
 “ This environment is not an ideal situation to cook , ” said David Chang , the founder of Momofuku .
 He wa among 23 star chef who fed 376 guest at the Edible Schoolyard NYC spring benefit on Monday night , which honored it founder , Alice Waters , a pioneer of the local food movement . The chef had to make do with impromptu kitchen , set up on folding table inside the glassy public atrium at 180 Maiden Lane .
 Every single chef wa jury-rigging , Mr. Chang said . “ It ’ s not ideal , ” he added . “ But we all believe in trying to do it right for Alice , who ha been a real mentor to a lot of people . ”
 He managed to create a five-course meal for his table , including a cold fried chicken and an Earl Grey pie . Across the room , Danny Bowien of Mission Chinese Food ( wearing a Green Day T-shirt and lacy short-shorts ) dazzled his guest with nine course , including a prime rib flambé that briefly set fire to the tablecloth .
 Also producing marvel were Greg Baxtrom of Olmsted , Corey Chow of Per Se , Tom Colicchio of Craft , Clare de Boer and Jess Shadbolt of King , and Ignacio Mattos of Estela .
 Bette Midler introduced Ms . Waters , who spoke of her mission to provide nutritious lunch to the nation ’ s public schoolchildren . Eating it all up , literally and figuratively , were Carolyn Murphy , the former model ; Marie-Chantal and Pavlos of Greece ; Aerin Lauder , the beauty heiress ; Agnes Gund , the art philanthropist ; and Lela Rose and Maria Cornejo , the fashion designer .
 Martha Stewart and her consigliere , Kevin Sharkey ( wearing — gasp ! — an unironed cotton shirt ) , were especially grateful for the meal .
 “ We just got back from Cuba , where food is very limited , ” Ms. Stewart said . “ And we were starving . ”

 Wakanda forever , indeed . While “ Black Panther ” join the small list of film with predominantly black cast to be nominated for best picture , it ’ s been le forever and more accurately never that an African-American ha received a nomination in the production design category . On Tuesday , Hannah Beachler changed history with her nod for the rich African world she helped imagine for “ Black Panther. ” It ’ s a highlight in a career already filled with cultural touchstone , including Beyoncé ’ s “ Lemonade ” and Barry Jenkins ’ s “ Moonlight . ”
 [ Read more about the nomination | Check out the full list of nominee | See the snub and surprise . ]
 Beachler found out about the nomination — one of seven for “ Black Panther ” — while working on set in Cincinnati for Todd Haynes ’ s latest feature . They were in the middle of a take when she got the call from her agent .
 “ I had to run to the back of the warehouse where the catering wa so I could yell , ” she said , speaking by phone . “ And then I cried . ”
 The major Oscar category like acting , directing and picture are the one often most scrutinized for diversity or lack thereof , but the so-called below-the-line or technical category have been even slower to recognize achievement for craftspeople of color .
 Beachler said that she wa grateful to the film ’ s director , Ryan Coogler , who ha hired her for all of his feature . “ When I met him , everything changed , ” she recalled . “ He ’ s my filmmaking family . ”
 Their collaboration , which include “ Fruitvale Station ” and “ Creed , ” put Beachler ’ s talent in the spotlight . Those include the smoky , sensual , feel-the-humidity-through-the-screen design texture she brought to Beyoncé ’ s “ Lemonade ” and the low-key , yet crackling with personality set she put together for Barry Jenkins ’ s best picture-winner , “ Moonlight . ”
 Extensive research ha been crucial in each of her project , even the smallest , so she wa prepared for something with a Marvel-size scope . That meant studying the ancient ruin of Mpumalanga in South Africa and bringing element of it design into Wakanda , the fictional setting for “ Black Panther. ” She said , “ I started by asking , if there existed a culture that wa that advanced , where would they be now ? ”
 The production designer hope that opportunity for diversity in the industry will continue to advance a well .
 “ You never think a girl from Ohio , in the middle of nowhere , can get here , ” she said . “ It ’ s a mission to let other girl and woman of color know that they can do the same . ”

 Loved by Wall Streeters and scruffy comic book junky alike , Chameleon Comics wa a clubhouse in the Financial District .

 Jason Winn burst into Chameleon Comics & Cards looking like Superman stumbling upon kryptonite .
 “ What is going on ? ” Mr. Winn said to the regular in the shop who had already read the handwritten sign outside .
 Their glum face told the story : Chameleon wa shutting it door after nearly 30 year in Manhattan ’ s Financial District .
 “ This shop wa like home to me , ” said Mr. Winn , a paralegal , who work nearby and had grown used to his steady fix of Chameleon ’ s eclectic selection of comic book , graphic novel , baseball card and action figure . “ These kind of comic shop are shutting down left and right . ”
 Beyond the shop ’ s merchandise , the scene wa what really attracted a steady cadre of regular , from scruffy comic junky in search of bargain to well-dressed Wall Streeters looking to drop serious money on the store ’ s impressive selection of collectible baseball card .
 They all shared a common despondency during the shop ’ s last week before it closed on March 31 . And they came together one last time to lament the demise of their favorite gathering spot , a place where you could land bargain while discussing the latest release with like-minded collector .
 “ At this shop , they always had a personal relationship with the customer . They always worked with me and gave me a deal . You can ’ t get that kind of service at a corporate store . ”
 — Jason Winn , 38
 The store ’ s owner , Steve Wu , 50 , said business had been declining for year and that he could no longer afford to stay open now that his lease wa ending and his landlord wa raising the rent significantly .
 Mr. Wu would not disclose the exact amount , but said the increase would put his rent well over $ 10,000 per month for the 500-square-foot shop on Maiden Lane just east of Broadway .
 Business , he said , never quite rebounded after the Sept. 11 terrorist attack occurred several block away . Also , he added , younger people do not seem to collect comic like older generation did .
 The shop is one of many small service-style business that caters to the work force that fill the area on weekday . Inside , it wa hardly a charming space — sparsely decorated with worn beige tile underfoot and large fluorescent light overhead , along with a large inflatable Spiderman doll hanging from the ceiling .
 But the drab décor only seemed to make the colorful comic book and graphic novel pop out even more from their display case , which had small sign issuing edict such a “ No Reading ” and “ This Is Not a Library . ”
 In the store ’ s last day , shopper sought to take advantage of the store ’ s everything-must-go sale .
 A stack of Superboy comic from the late 1960s were being sold for $ 10 apiece . In the baseball card case , a Carl Yastrzemski rookie card from 1960 cost $ 125 , but one of him from 1972 went for $ 3 .
 “ These kind of store are what make New York great , ” said one customer , Wayne Manos , 66 , a Marvel and DC Comics lover and a Topps baseball card aficionado who began frequenting the store while working at the now defunct American Stock Exchange .
 “ We became part of the community — a lot of people came here just to hang out and get away from work , ” said Mr. Wu , a he hugged some of his customer . “ But with a store like this , the profit margin is very low . It ’ s not like a Chanel store where you can make a few sale a day . ”
 He tried looking for other retail space in downtown Manhattan , he said , “ but the rent are just too crazy . ”
 NEW YORK CITY is known around the world for the big stuff — iconic guidebook attraction like the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty . But New Yorkers know that the city ’ s essence lie in the smaller , neighborhood place that make up it unique fabric . If not well known , they are certainly well loved : the local dive bar or diner ; the quirky Laundromat ; the tiny shoe repair shop . And while the city is always in transition , the change these day seems relentless . Beloved spot are succumbing to high rent and are often replaced by chain business . Here then is a celebration of place that are closing ( or just hanging on ) .
 “ I wanted it to be a laboratory . ”
 “ These kind of comic shop are shutting down left and right . ”
 “ It ’ s been a comfort station for the neighborhood . ”
 “ Too much of it is already destroyed . ’ ’
 “ This is the Cheers of Park Slope . ”
 “ It ’ s been a true community effort . ”

 A WOMAN IS NO MAN By Etaf Rum
 In a hushed bedroom , a woman smear foundation over the bruise on her daughter-in-law ’ s face , layer after silencing layer . “ There are thing in this life no one should see , ” she tell the young woman her son ha beaten . “ When I wa your age , I never let anyone see my shame . ”
 Etaf Rum ’ s debut novel is a dauntless exploration of the pathology of silence , an attempt to unsnarl the dark knot of history , culture , fear and trauma that can render conservative Arab-American woman so visibly invisible . “ Where I come from , ” her narrator begin , “ we keep these story to ourselves . To tell them to the outside world is unheard-of , dangerous , the ultimate shame . But you have seen u . ”
 From a refugee camp near Ramallah to a Brooklyn rowhouse , “ A Woman Is No Man ” follows three generation of Palestinian woman a they confront the claustrophobic expectation that continue to shape their life . In the spring of 1990 , Isra Hadid accepts a marriage proposal that will take her to America , her heart full of fairy-tale hope . Eighteen year later , her eldest daughter , Deya Ra ’ ad , longs for college but reluctantly considers potential husband at the urging of her grandmother Fareeda . When an anonymous note lure Deya to a Manhattan bookshop , the story she know about her family is violently rewritten .
 The daughter of Palestinian immigrant , born and raised in Brooklyn , Rum is keenly aware of the risk of exposing her community to the scrutiny of narrative . It ’ s a devil ’ s bargain : Speak and add inadvertent fuel to the ever-smoldering fire of anti-Arabism — or don ’ t speak and add another layer of silence . “ I knew that a long a I stayed away from controversial topic like arranged marriage and domestic abuse , no one would criticize me or call me a traitor . No one would shun me . No one would try to hurt me , ” Rum ha explained . “ Perhaps these fear are why there aren ’ t many Arab-American woman on bookshelf ; why , whenever I search for our story in bookstore and library , I can not find them . ”
 There ’ s a burden that come with being among the first of your kind ; the potential for misinterpretation is too great to leave much to chance . What emerges is a story a didactic a it is brave . “ A Woman Is No Man ” is both a love letter to storytelling and a careful object lesson in it power . Timorous Isra ’ s heroine is Scheherazade , the bewitching taleteller of “ The Thousand and One Nights. ” “ No one asks Scheherazade to marry the king , ” she marvel . “ She volunteer on behalf of all woman to save the daughter of Muslims everywhere . For 1,001 night , Scheherazade ’ s story were resistance . Her voice wa a weapon . ”
 Of Rum ’ s three woman , it is implacable Fareeda — enforcer of norm , keeper of secret — whose voice prof the most revelatory . Her marriage at 14 to a stranger in the dust of the al-Am ’ ari refugee camp ha “ made a warrior out of her , ” yet she fight to uphold a system where “ the shame of her gender wa engraved on her bones. ” It ’ s a startling portrait of the mechanic of complicity , of the intergenerational pathology of silence .
 “ It took more than one woman to do thing differently , ” Fareeda reflects , wearily . “ It took a world of them. ” Across the globe , a bold new generation of Arab woman are putting that defeatism to the test by sharing their story . The triumph of Rum ’ s novel is that she refuse to measure her woman against anything but their own heart and history . “ It ’ s hard to belong anywhere , truly belong , if we don ’ t belong to ourselves first , ” Deya is told . Distinctly , defiantly and earnestly , “ A Woman Is No Man ” belongs to itself .

 The only surprising thing about finding out that I had a stress fracture wa that it hadn ’ t happened before . For nearly 13 year of running , I had avoided the dreaded walking boot . That streak ended last week .
 Spring race : canceled . Spirits : deflated . Dog who like to go on walk five time a day : annoyed .
 You may be reading this and thinking — ugh , why run , Jen ? This sound so painful . And let me tell you : Cracking your tibia is quite painful . It ’ s annoying too . I don ’ t enjoy walking like a penguin , or how difficult it is to drive a stick shift car right now ( when I drive at all ) . And a nice a it sound to work from bed , I ’ d prefer to be writing from my usual spot at the dining room table , where my dog can ’ t try to jump on my laptop while I tell you how miserable I am .
 But if I step back and look back over my time running , three injury in 13 year doesn ’ t seem like all that terrible of a trade . In the grand scheme of potential catastrophe , four week in a walking boot isn ’ t so bad . It ’ s not a if one of my organ doesn ’ t want to work anymore or even that my tibia cracked all the way through . I can still walk the dog , although it ’ s slower than usual . Considering everything that could go wrong , being annoyed because I hurt my leg is one of the least bad thing .
 But already a longing to run free ha set in . I ’ m trying to look at it this way : If I hadn ’ t spent more than a decade doing this one physical thing that brings me so much joy — and ha kept me healthy , happy and strong — I wouldn ’ t know what I wa missing , and what I ’ ll be getting back to , sometime later this year .
 I know a lot of you have been through this , and have probably been stuck in the clunky black walking boot , too . Have you figured out a way to make it le ugly ? Did you bedazzle it with all the free time you suddenly had because you couldn ’ t run ? Show me your boot ! I ’ m on Twitter @ byjenamiller .

 PARIS — More than simply an iconic cathedral and jewel of Gothic architecture , Notre Dame wa a treasure trove , housing priceless and irreplaceable marvel of immense religious , artistic , musical , historical and architectural value .
 Some were lost to humanity forever in the blaze that ravaged the Paris cathedral Monday . Others were spared , at least in part , or saved before the flame consumed the roof and spire .
 A look at what is known about Notre Dame 's treasure and their fate .
 ____
 CROWN OF THORNS
 Regarded a the cathedral 's most sacred relic , Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo say the Crown of Thorns wa saved . It is purported to be a relic of the crown placed on the head of Jesus Christ at his crucifixion , obtained and brought to Paris by King Louis IX in the 13th century . It is made of rush wrapped into a wreath and tied with gold filament . Since 1896 it ha been kept under glass and only occasionally displayed . Paris Deputy Mayor Emmanuel Gregoire said it wa among piece quickly transported to a `` secret location '' by official after the fire . Hidalgo also said on Twitter that the tunic of St. Louis , a long shirt-like garment from the 13th century and believed to have belonged to King Louis IX , wa also rescued .
 ___
 FRAGMENT OF THE HOLY CROSS AND NAIL
 The 24-centimeter ( 9.45-inch ) piece of wood and 9-centimeter- ( 3.5-inch ) -long nail are purported to be from the cross on which Jesus Christ wa crucified . The wood fragment is kept in a glass case . The fate of the two relic is not known .
 __
 THE ORGAN
 The impressive organ dating to the 1730s and boasting an estimated 8,000 pipe did not burn and is intact , but nobody know yet whether it wa damaged by the heat or water . `` The organ is a very fragile instrument , '' Bertrand de Feydeau , vice-president of the Fondation du Patrimoine which protects France 's cultural heritage , tell The Associated Press . He say the organ ha `` incredible '' sound , with `` very rich color , '' and there is a waiting list of more than two year of organist wanting to play it . Each pipe wa individually cleaned during a 2013 refurbishment .
 ___
 THE ROOF
 The cathedral 's roof wa built using a lattice of giant beam cut from tree in primeval forest in the 12th and 13th century . Experts say France no longer ha tree big enough to replace the ancient wooden beam that burned in the Notre Dame fire . Feydeau told France Info radio that the cathedral 's roof can not be rebuilt exactly a it wa before the fire because `` we do n't , at the moment , have tree on our territory of the size that were cut in the 13th century . '' He said the restoration work will have to use new technology to rebuild the roof .
 ____
 THE BELLS
 In the wake of the French Revolution , the cathedral wa declared a `` Temple of Reason '' a part of an anti-clerical movement . All of the original bell were destroyed and replaced — except for one , called Emmanuel and weighing 13 ton . In 2013 , a the cathedral celebrated it 850 year with a refurbishment , nine huge new bell replaced the 19th-century one . The peal of the cathedral 's bell ha long been famous . Quasimodo wa the cathedral 's bell-ringer in Victor Hugo 's 1831 novel `` The Hunchback of Notre Dame . '' The extent of any damage to the bell and their support structure is unclear .
 ____
 PAINTINGS
 About a dozen large painting of religious scene , called `` Mays '' and dating from between 1630 and 1708 , hung in Notre Dame . French Culture Minister Franck Riester say the cathedral 's greatest painting will be removed starting Friday . `` We assume they have not been damaged by the fire but there may be damage from the smoke , '' he said .
 ____
 STATUES
 Last week , 16 religious statue got a lucky escape from Monday 's blaze : they were removed from the top of Notre Dame for the first time in over a century to be taken for cleaning . The removal wa part of a restoration of the cathedral 's towering spire , now gone . The 3-meter-tall copper statue represent the 12 apostle and four evangelist .
 ____
 STAINED GLASS WINDOWS
 The cathedral 's three famed rose window date to the 13th century . The director of the United Nations cultural organization say it 's too early to tell whether they are unscathed . Audrey Azoulay tell The Associated Press art expert have n't yet been able to ass the site yet after the blaze , though she ha received encouraging report . Notre Dame is part of a UNESCO heritage site .

 Studying radon ’ s role in the electrification of plume above volcano could help people anticipate the damage resulting from eruption , scientist say .
 By Robin George Andrews
 As plume of ash rise from a volcano , volcanic lightning sometimes erupts within it cloud . As it pierce through the billowing darkness , resembling a supernatural rage , the lightning ’ s incandescent flash warn volcanologists far away that a potentially dangerous tower of ash is skyward .
 In order to get lightning , the plume must be electrified . Generally , it ’ s assumed that ash particle jostling within the volcanic tempest build up huge electrical imbalance that can only be neutralized by supercharged bolt . But something else may contribute to the electrification of volcanic plume .
 By sending balloon-lofted electricity-detecting instrument over Sicily ’ s hyperactive Stromboli volcano , scientist discovered that even volcanic cloud that lack ash contain substantial amount of charge . The source of this phantom electrification could be the decay of volcanic radon , an odorless and colorless radioactive compound .
 [ Like the Science Times page on Facebook . | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter . ]
 A similar process may occur above radon-emitting volcano around the world , said Karen Aplin , a physicist at the University of Bristol ’ s Department of Aerospace Engineering and a co-author of the study published this month in Geophysical Research Letters . If radon-driven electrification influence the behavior and lifetime of volcanic ash plume — the very same that can down plane , bury city and suffocate farm — then understanding the gas ’ s role could help people downwind from an eruption be better prepared .
 It ’ s well-known that the friction between volcanic ash generates huge amount of electrical charge . This process , known a triboelectricity , is the same reason that you can rub a balloon on your head and marvel a it stick there , hands-free .
 Ice particle bumping into ash particle also aid electrification , a doe lava tearing itself apart . The simultaneous interaction of these process make studying volcanic lightning and unraveling it enigmatic intricacy difficult .
 To simplify thing , the author of this study tried something new .
 They wanted to measure the charge in an ash-free plume , and Stromboli — which ha spectacular lava fountain matched only by it extremely gassy outburst — wa the perfect place for the experiment .
 According to their calculation , the charge the researcher detected within these volcanic belch could easily be generated by the decay of radon , a significant component of the gas emitted by the volcano ’ s activity . It ’ s well-established that a radon decay , it release charged particle that collide with compound in the air , ionizing them . This , the researcher suspect , wa electrifying the ash-free plume .
 “ We can ’ t be sure that it is radon which is generating the charge in such plume without many further measurement , ” said Keri Nicoll , an atmospheric scientist at the Universities of Reading and Bath and the study ’ s lead author . But she added that it ’ s very likely that “ there are no other known charge generation mechanism that can explain our observation . ”
 While it contributes , radon is probably not the sole arbiter of volcanic lightning . It certainly generates charge , but a Dr. Aplin explained , “ it ’ s unlikely that the radon mechanism alone could ever be strong enough to generate volcanic lightning without the help of ash . ”
 Cassandra Smith , an expert on volcanic lightning at the University of South Florida who wa not involved in the study , agrees . She pointed out that no lightning wa generated by that radon-rich , ash-free plume over Stromboli . She ha also seen lightning appear during eruption at Sakurajima volcano that feature extremely small amount of ash .
 With all this in mind , Dr. Smith speculated “ that ash charging mechanism are still dominant for lightning generation in volcanic plumes. ” But there will be future opportunity to quantify radon ’ s contribution to plume electrification and volcanic lightning .
 Oliver Lamb , a volcanologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who wa not involved in the study , said that radon escape from volcano “ in all corner of the world , ” including Chile ’ s Villarrica , Guatemala ’ s Fuego , Japan ’ s Sakurajima and Nicaragua ’ s Masaya .
 While more work remains to be done , Dr. Lamb said that the radon mechanism “ doe look very promising . ”

 The phenomenally popular ( and lucrative ) HBO show could go the way of “ Star Wars , ” Harry Potter and Disney ’ s Marvelverse .

 When “ Game of Thrones ” finally wrap up on May 19 , at least one of the story ’ s central figure would like the end to be the actual end .
 “ Why [ expletive ] with it ? ” Emilia Clarke , the Dragon Queen herself , said recently .
 “ It ’ s a phenomenon that no one ever saw coming , so I completely understand why anyone would be like , let ’ s make 1,500 more since that ’ s a recipe that work , ” she added . “ I just don ’ t think they should . ”
 Pop culture trend and market pressure might ultimately work against her , however , and a prequel pilot is already in the work . So a HBO ’ s biggest ever hit prepares to begin it final season on April 14 , a definitional question hang over it future : Is “ Game of Thrones ” a series ? Or is it a universe ?
 Based on viewing , industry impact and global attention , “ Thrones ” is one of the biggest blockbuster in TV history . But a giant corporation buy one another and plan bottomless new streaming platform in an ever more feverish battle for your eyeball and entertainment dollar , blockbuster are not enough anymore .
 So while there are only six episode remaining in the sprawling saga of Jon Snow , Daenerys Targaryen , Tyrion and friend , we ’ ve likely only begun exploring Westeros .
 Consider “ Star Wars. ” Since Disney bought Lucasfilm in 2012 for $ 4 billion , it ha strip-mined the franchise , conceiving multiple movie trilogy , stand-alone film and TV series , a well a an enormous presence in Disney ’ s theme park . ( Next up for the “ Thrones ” creator David Benioff and D.B . Weiss : A series of “ Star Wars ” film . )
 Or Harry Potter ( like “ Game of Thrones , ” part of the WarnerMedia empire ) , which after the eight film based on the book is now deep into the “ Fantastic Beasts ” prequel series , and also ha tourist attraction all over the world .
 Or the mightiest pop culture universe of all : Disney ’ s Marvel , which later this month will close out the “ Avengers ” filament of the Marvelverse , with “ Avengers : Endgame , ” but in June extend the X-Men branch with “ Dark Phoenix , ” starring Sansa Stark herself , Sophie Turner .
 So wouldn ’ t the phenomenally popular ( and lucrative ) “ Game of Thrones ” be a prime candidate for a similar treatment ?
 The case in favor includes nearly every detail surrounding the show . In February , AT & T received final clearance for it $ 85.4 billion merger with HBO ’ s corporate parent Time Warner , and will launch a WarnerMedia streaming platform to compete with coming service from Disney — which also just closed a $ 71.3 billion deal to buy 21st Century Fox — and Apple , along with the existing stalwart Netflix , Amazon and Hulu .
 The streaming service will draw from Warner ’ s vast collection of film and show from property like Warner Bros. and Turner a well a HBO . HBO Now , the network ’ s current streaming app , is expected to stick around but HBO ’ s original series and other offering will be incorporated into the WarnerMedia service , meaning “ Game of Thrones ” could appear alongside the like of Harry Potter movie , “ Wonder Woman ” and “ Friends . ”
 John Stankey , the AT & T executive put in charge of WarnerMedia , ha said HBO will get a bigger programming budget in order to ramp up production . “ We want to increase our investment in premium content , ” he said last summer on an earnings call . How much , if any , of that content will be “ Thrones ” -related is an open question . ( AT & T declined to comment . ) But the telecom presumably didn ’ t buy Time Warner just to let one of it most valuable piece of intellectual property go dark .
 “ Thrones ” is also already based on a universe , the Song of Ice and Fire series created by George R.R . Martin , that is so dense with history and lore , it could fuel dozen of series and movie .
 “ The universe is too rich not to try , ” said Casey Bloys , HBO ’ s president of programming . “ But on the other hand , I also don ’ t want to do it just to do it . ”
 The prequel pilot , created by Martin and Jane Goldman , will go into production this summer . Set thousand of year before the event of “ Game of Thrones , ” it will explore the history of the White Walkers and the Stark family , and star Naomi Watts and Miranda Richardson , among others . It wa one of multiple prequel concept commissioned by HBO , which hasn ’ t ruled out moving forward with any of the others at some point .
 And starting next year , “ Thrones ” fan — like “ Star Wars , ” Potter and Marvel devotee — will be able to get their fix in the flesh .
 The Game of Thrones Studio Tour , a 110,000-square-foot tourist attraction , is slated to open in spring 2020 in Northern Ireland , where most of the show wa produced . The project , inspired by Warner Bros. ’ s Harry Potter studio tour outside London , will transform the Linen Mill Studios in Banbridge , where part of “ Thrones ” were shot , into an interactive exhibition of the show ’ s set , costume , prop and weapon .
 “ It ’ s going to be an immersive experience where fan will feel like they are inside their favorite set from the show , ” said Jeff Peters , HBO ’ s vice president for licensing and retail .
 Linen Mill Studios will be the first of a many a four former “ Thrones ” filming location in Northern Ireland to be transformed into interactive fan experience — other possibility include the still-standing set for King ’ s Landing , in Belfast , and Castle Black and the Wall , in a quarry outside the city . While there are not currently plan to create similar attraction in the United States , “ it ’ s possible , ” Peters said . “ We get pitched all the time , and we ’ re open to a lot of different opportunity . ”
 It ’ s worth noting that there are some potential obstacle to “ Game of Thrones ” becoming the next “ Star Wars. ” One is the firmly TV-MA tenor of the series — the risqué material precludes youngster from fueling the franchise a actively a they do for others . ( HBO argues that this will keep “ Thrones ” relevant even if it doesn ’ t add more series , a new generation discover the saga . )
 Another is HBO itself . The network became the crown jewel of television through it taste and commitment to quality ( the occasional “ Arli $ $ ” notwithstanding ) . It ’ s known for walking away from numerous pilot that didn ’ t meet it standard , and will only turn the prequel into an actual series if it life up to “ Thrones , ” Bloys said . “ I want to honor the high bar that Dan and David set with the original show , ” he said .
 As a result , it ’ s way too early to even start thinking of “ Thrones ” a a franchise , he added .
 “ To me , franchise denotes multiple film or multiple TV show living at the same time , ” he said . “ Not having even turned a camera on the prequel just yet , it ’ s premature to say at this point , to declare we ’ re going to have multiple series living at once . ”
 AT & T , however , ha shown no sign of being a hands-off or particularly patient owner . The former HBO chief executive Richard Plepler , a responsible a anyone for the network ’ s taste-making reputation , abruptly left the company two day after the Warner purchase received final clearance .
 There are already sign that AT & T plan to treat “ Thrones ” a one more synergistic cog in it corporate machine . Kristian Nairn , who played the fan favorite Hodor , wa tapped to appear this week at an AT & T store in Boston , where customer could also enter a sweepstakes for a seat on a “ Dragon Wagon ” to the season premiere in New York .
 One faction that is not much interested in any new version of “ Game of Thrones ” : the star of “ Game of Thrones . ”
 None of the current “ Thrones ” actor are involved with the pilot or have had any role in it development . The prequel “ came a a shock to all of u , ” Clarke said .
 The general sentiment from Clarke and others about any future “ Thrones ” series amount to basically , I wish them the best , I had the time of my life , but I ’ m out . ( One exception : the ever cagey Varys . “ Never say never , ” said Conleth Hill , who play him . )
 This isn ’ t terribly surprising , given the length and physical demand of “ Game of Thrones ” — and who know which character will survive the final season ? But the ongoing loosening of TV format would seem to open up plenty of opportunity , even for character that get killed off . What “ Thrones ” fan wouldn ’ t want a mini-series or HBO movie depicting prehistory like , say , Robert ’ s Rebellion and the event that turned Jaime Lannister into the Kingslayer ?
 Nikolaj Coster-Waldau , who play Jaime , hope the prequel is “ even more successful than ‘ Game of Thrones , ’ ” he said . But he ’ s not interested in ever returning to Westeros .
 “ You could only set yourself up for disappointment , ” he said . “ It ’ s been an amazing 10 year , but 10 year is a fair amount of time . ”
 Don ’ t count on a Sansa mini-series either . “ I never want to be in a corset ever again , ” Turner said .
 That said , there could be other opportunity for “ Thrones ” veteran if the show expands into the next great franchise . Its star might be at the pinnacle of the pop culture universe now , a the final season draw near , but some have been around long enough to know how quickly such thing can change .
 “ The cast member that now are so confident about the future , ” Coster-Waldau said . “ Five year from now we will all be guide at the Game of Thrones Land . ”

 The adopted sibling of “ The Umbrella Academy , ” which debut Friday on Netflix , are not your typical superheroes .
 They have offbeat superpower — the Rumor can cause thing to happen just by saying them aloud — and they were raised by an emotionally distant father , an android mother and a kind , talking chimpanzee .
 Most of this is revealed in flashback : The series pick up when the team , which fractured under the weight of it crime-fighting responsibility , reunites after the mysterious death of it adoptive father , Sir Reginald Hargreeves ( Colm Feore ) . Across 10 episode , viewer learn whether the family member can sufficiently get past their shared baggage in order to prevent an apocalypse foreseen by their time-traveling brother .
 [ Read our critic ’ s review of “ The Umbrella Academy ” ]
 Readers of the comic book , written by Gerard Way and drawn by Gabriel Bá , may feel they have a head start , but this is only somewhat true . The Netflix series , the cast of which includes Tom Hopper , Ellen Page and Robert Sheehan a member of the gifted but quarrelsome clan , will include moment not yet covered in the comic , which began in 2007 . ( It won an Eisner award in 2008 for best finite series . )
 “ I wrote this 20-page document that explains kind of everybody and how their power work and where the story ’ s heading , ” said Way , who , like Bá , is an executive producer on the show . ( They ’ ve weighed in on everything from the story to costume to set design , Way said . )
 Despite the success of the Umbrella Academy comic , Way is perhaps most popularly known a the former singer of the theatrical rock band My Chemical Romance — he recorded a cover of “ Hazy Shade of Winter ” for the show . In a recent telephone interview , Way discussed both version of “ The Umbrella Academy , ” the comic book that have influenced him and , naturally , Liza Minnelli . These are edited excerpt from the conversation .
 How did the Umbrella Academy comic originally come about ?
 My initial inspiration wa a few different thing . I had been such a fan of the Marvel Silver Age , and I grew up reading Chris Claremont ’ s X-Men . Marvel character had a lot of issue and problem , but I wanted to give them deeper , more complex problem . I wa also reading Hellboy by Mike Mignola , and to me that wa a postmodern horror comic . There wa nothing like that for superheroes . I usually try to make thing that I wish existed that I would want to listen to or read .
 When did you sense that it wa connecting with reader ?
 It connected really early . The first issue came out , and I think a lot of people expected it to be pretty bad . I mean , I came from a rock band . Not a lot of people knew my history of having written a comic at 15 , going to the School of Visual Arts for cartooning and illustration , studying comic for many year , then interning at DC Comics . A lot of people just expected some sort of vanity project . I don ’ t fault them for that .
 Is it weird to have someone else steering the Umbrella Academy now , at least on TV ?
 I never felt like I lost control so much a I relinquished a bit of control . At the beginning , I wa asked how closely I wanted to work with a showrunner , if I wanted to be on set every day . I wa really focused on the book and creating the mythology that the show would pull from . I also started an imprint with DC Comics , so I had quite a lot of thing going on . When I go in on something , I go all in . I would have been sleeping on the set . I didn ’ t think it wa the right time for me to dive into TV that way . That may change in the future . But at that stage I kind of relinquished control to Steve Blackman [ the showrunner ] and all the people making the show . I never felt like we were not heard .
 The TV family is much more diverse than in the comic . Did you have an influence on that ?
 I did , and the greatest change is that the casting wa so much more inclusive and diverse than the source material . I thought that wa a massive improvement . It wa something we all talked about really early on . We have this really great opportunity because these kid are adopted from all over the world , and they could really be from anywhere .
 Why didn ’ t you take that approach in the comic ?
 I wasn ’ t a very good listener . I spent a lot of year just shouting and being on stage and being in control of thing . I didn ’ t understand other people ’ s story , and what I learned to do over the year is kind of shut my mouth and listen to people of different ethnicity and take a look at their struggle . Diversity is something we ’ re addressing in the Umbrella Academy comic . It ’ s something Gabriel and I actively work on .
 How involved were you with the music choice in the show ?
 I didn ’ t have a lot of say in the soundtrack . Steve ha a very distinct vision of the song he want in the show . He actually writes the song in the script . So I didn ’ t get to weigh in much on music , though I am a fan of Queen , obviously , and I really like that Tiffany song . I tend to skew toward thing that are maybe a little more underground or thing that maybe people haven ’ t heard before .
 You ’ ve shifted from music and performing to writing comic to giving note on a TV show . Do the different skill inform one another ?
 I ’ ve always considered myself a visual thinker . I ’ ve always seen Umbrella Academy a a comic , but in my head I saw it play out like a film . But all these job feed into each other , and I learn from all of them . It ’ s interesting to , let ’ s say , give note on screenplay and TV and apply that to the note you give yourself on the comic , and vice versa .
 What comic creator have influenced you ? Grant Morrison wa in one of your video .
 He wa gracious enough to play the villain in the story of the last My Chemical Romance record , “ The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys. ” I ’ m dear friend with Grant . I consider him to be not only a friend but a mentor . The biggest thing I borrow from what he doe is , when you read a Grant Morrison comic , per page you get more idea than sometimes in a whole issue or graphic novel . One of the best piece of advice he ever gave me is “ Don ’ t save up your idea , just use them all because you ’ ll just come up with more. ” I ’ ve kind of always stuck with that . And his wild imagination ha inspired me to kind of try and tap into my own imagination .
 What ’ s the biggest obstacle for your various creative pursuit ?
 It ’ s the time to get there . That ’ s the biggest obstacle . My family is also important to me , and one of the really big positive of getting to write comic is I ’ ve been able to spend a lot of time with them and watch Bandit [ his daughter ] grow and be there for her a a father . That made me shy away from touring . But I ’ m really focused on comic because I ’ m home . Hopefully , I ’ ll have the time to finish the series out properly .
 This is off-topic but I have to ask : How did you end up working with Liza Minnelli on the “ Black Parade ” album ?
 I love Liza Minnelli . “ Black Parade ” wa very theatrical , and we had this song “ Mama , ” and I said , “ You know , it would be really great in this one part to get Liza. ” Rob Cavallo , the producer , made a couple of call and she said she would love to do it . We recorded that remotely — we were in Los Angeles , at Capitol , and she wa in New York with a different engineer . It wa really cool . The first time I got to speak to her wa through the mixing board .

 A few year ago , the Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield made a music video . Click over to YouTube and you can see him , singing David Bowie ’ s “ Space Oddity ” a he drift in zero gravity . The guitar ha Velcro patch — adorable . If an extended space mission involves enough downtime for classic rock cover , how bad can it be ?
 Pretty bad . In “ Spaceman , ” at the Wild Project in Manhattan , the American astronaut Molly Jennis is sitting alone in her tin can , seven month into an eight-month journey to Mars . That ’ s pretty quick . But it ’ s a long enough time for Molly ( unlike Mr. Hadfield , she ha no International Space Station buddy to hang with ) to grow increasingly maddened by the isolation and pressure .
 Ingenious and punishing , “ Spaceman ” stay with Molly ( Erin Treadway ) a she check her air pressure , fuel level and trajectory . ( The clever capsule is designed by Carolyn Mraz . ) A superstar scientist and a gifted athlete , Molly seems made for a solo mission . Of course , this being theater , she ha also been lumbered with a tragic back story , which may unmake her .
 During her jaunt , Molly ha devised ritual and coping mechanism , like the made-up song she sings to herself and her workout with resistance band . Sucking down a tube of egg , she imago making herself a steaming omelet . Scrubbing herself down with a wet wipe , she picture a luxurious bath with Epsom salt . Every day she ha to find time to answer interview question for various network . Molly ’ s voyage , you see , is corporate sponsored . Her spacesuit ha Google and Coca-Cola logo emblazoned on it , and , among the big-time donor are the major network , a well a a Japanese game show that dare her to eat zero-gravity marshmallow .
 When loneliness overwhelms her , she talk to her pet plant , Sip , or strike up a conversation with her Mission Buddy , Jim , a friendly computer simulation who would never make it past the first minute of a Turing test .
 “ It ’ s just boredom then panic . Boredom then panic , ” Molly say of life in orbit . “ I got ta find a better way . ”
 Boredom then panic , boredom then panic , is not the kindest way to describe the feeling that Leegrid Stevens ’ s play , directed by Jacob Titus for Loading Dock Theater , evokes . But it ’ s not far off . The show is imaginative , and in term of it design — Ms. Mraz ’ s set , Simon Cleveland ’ s pulsing lighting , Mr. Stevens ’ s seat-shaking sound design — a magnificent example of what Off Off Broadway can do . When Molly face her first crisis , the flashing light and shrieking bleep are an absolute marvel , immediately summoning terror . By the third or fourth calamity , I took to gritting my teeth and covering my ear .

 A flash spotted on livestreams wa likely caused by the crash of a tiny , fast-moving meteoroid left behind by a comet .
 By Robin George Andrews
 On Sunday and Monday , those in the Western Hemisphere with clear sky were fortunate enough to see the last total lunar eclipse of the decade . As the moon took on a distinctly redder shade just before midnight Eastern Time , livestreams of the phenomenon showed a flash of light suddenly and briefly emanating from the lunar surface .
 Anthony Cook , an astronomical observer at Los Angeles ’ Griffith Observatory which streamed the eclipse , thought it could have just been the camera ’ s random electronic noise . Then astronomer and citizen scientist started to share their detection of the flash on Reddit and Twitter .
 The only explanation wa that something slammed into the lunar surface and obliterated itself .
 [ Sign up to get reminder for space and astronomy event on your calendar . ]
 The moon is a multi-billion-year-old library of impact event , with fresh collision still taking place frequently today . Capturing a lunar impact on video is rare enough , but this event — a collision during a total lunar eclipse — may be a first .
 “ I have not heard of anyone seeing an impact like this during a lunar eclipse before , ” said Sara Russell , a professor of planetary science at the Natural History Museum in London .
 Dr. Russell said that flash can only be seen from Earth when the lunar surface is in shadow , which is normally just a few day before and after the new moon . A luminous full moon is anathema to such detection , but a total lunar eclipse , painting our pale celestial companion in darkness , changed that .
 Justin Cowart , a graduate student in geosciences at Stony Brook University in New York who spotted the flash , managed to narrow down the impact location . Using image from an amateur astronomer , Christian Fröschlin , Mr. Cowart determined that the flash took place somewhere in the lunar highland , south of Byrgius crater .
 NASA ’ s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter , which study the moon ’ s surface , may soon spot the fresh crater . But the impact flash itself can be used to roughly estimate the size of the object that crashed on the moon , and it momentum . Based on NASA and European Space Agency database of impact flash , Mr. Cowart guess that “ it wa probably somewhere between the size of an acorn and tennis ball . ”
 Detection data from the Moon Impacts Detection and Analysis System , or MIDAS , found that the space rock wa a pipsqueak of a meteoroid , only weighing something like 22 pound , and measuring no more than 12 inch across .
 The provenance of the meteoroid remains an open question . According to Jose Maria Madiedo , an astrophysicist at the University of Huelva in Spain who is a co-director of the MIDAS system , most object that hit Earth come from comet and not asteroid , and the same applies to the moon
 With that in mind , he said , “ the most likely situation is that the impactor wa a rock from a comet . ”
 Considering it tiny dimension , it must have been moving at an incredible speed to create a flash of light visible from Earth . Indeed , Dr. Madiedo said that the impact velocity would be in the range of 38,000 mile per hour . That is just over twice the speed that NASA ’ s old space shuttle had to move after launch to achieve orbit of Earth .
 A total lunar eclipse is always something to marvel at , but one being gate-crashed by a hypersonic cometary shard is something else entirely .
 An earlier version of this article , using information from an astronomer , misstated where on the moon a flash of light wa seen . It wa south of the Byrgius crater , not west of Legendre crater .

 ELSEWHERE , HOME By Leila Aboulela
 If literary realism attempt to hold a mirror to the world , then Leila Aboulela ’ s “ Elsewhere , Home ” is an especially vivid reflection in a pond , a accurate a glass ’ s gaze but rippled to capture life a a thing shivering and fluid even when seemingly still .
 Born in Cairo , Aboulela grew up in Sudan and is now living in Scotland . “ Elsewhere , Home ” encompasses some of her earliest work from the late ’ 90 through to her most recent , and 11 out of the 13 entry have been published before . And yet there is a freshness here , in part due to the scarcity of Muslim European voice in America .
 But the force of Aboulela ’ s writing exceeds it representational significance : She animates so many well-rounded character who not only honor , but also dare to challenge , the culture they come from . There are no simple bad-good , European-Muslim dichotomy here . Each individual portrait — and the book operates best a a study in portraiture — is complex , but not gratuitously so . These intricacy of bicultural family and friendship carry a delicate strength that doesn ’ t just resemble life , it is life , for reader who believe more in the shifting pond reflection than in the static mirror image .
 One marvel at a sort of uniformity in this quiet collection that transcends theme , setting , subject . Critics sometimes speak of writer a having “ found their voice , ” but this book is a testament to one who ’ s always had hers . Moving gracefully between scene , that consistent voice familiarizes u with not just the character , but the author herself .
 Tales of immigrant are not scarce in the United States , but we Americans nevertheless maintain our shallow concept of their experience — particularly those of Muslim immigrant in Europe . Khartoum , Cairo , Aberdeen , Edinburgh , Abu Dhabi , London : This book ’ s diversity of place and perspective collectively expands , without fanfare , on all the usual trope of identity . Ask Jeeves and the Kindle , along with casual reference to global and regional regime shift , are it only marker of time . The collection ’ s final story achieves an almost absolute universality . In “ Pages of Fruit , ” the narrator trace her decade of admiration for a female writer : “ This wa the first time I recognized myself in fiction , ” she imago herself saying to the author . “ In your work I saw my country , my value and the social circle I grew up in. ” Despite the story ’ s specificity both comic and tragic , it theme of the uniting influence of literature will resonate with anyone , anywhere . What is Sudanese and what is Scottish become almost weirdly incidental in Aboulela ’ s consistent , confident directness . We believe everything .
 Yet nothing is diluted or compromised in the coalescence ; somehow Aboulela manages to create this tapestry devoid of clichés . Her character are a real and conflicted a we are — critical and defensive of their faith , trapped and liberated by their ethnicity , constantly longing for home even when resisting it complicated comfort .
 It is in the handful of first-person story that Aboulela ’ s prose shine brightest : “ I ’ m floppy without him , ” a newly pregnant woman say of her husband in “ Expecting to Give. ” In “ Colored Lights , ” a BBC employee mourns the untimely death of his brother Taha : “ When he died , my mind bent a little and ha never straightened since. ” Her expression are both novel and yet poignantly relatable .
 It ’ s high time for Aboulela , who ’ s won Britain ’ s Caine Prize for African Writing and Scotland ’ s Saltire Literary Award , to gather her accolade in this country a well . The editor John Freeman ha called her “ one of the best short story writer alive , ” and this is one blurb that ’ s no exaggeration . “ Elsewhere , Home ” is a perfect introduction to a writer whose fiction doesn ’ t stray too far from home — she ha a lot in common with her Muslim , Cairo-born , Khartoum-raised , Aberdeen-transplant character — while still embracing a multiplicity of merging , clashing world . Hers is the first collection I ’ ve read since James Joyce ’ s “ Dubliners ” that reminded me of the life-changing power of furiously honest realism .
 The headline with an earlier version of this review misstated the author ’ s publishing history . Previous book by Leila Aboulela have appeared in the United States ; “ Elsewhere , Home ” is not her American debut .
 Porochista Khakpour is the author of two novel and , most recently , the memoir “ Sick . ”

 LONDON — For some Britons who watched Notre Dame burn so fiercely in Paris , the horror wa mixed with apprehension . What happened to the French landmark this week could easily befall the Houses of Parliament in London .
 The seat of Britain 's government is a crumbling , leaky , rodent-infested fire trap that fire warden must patrol around the clock to avoid an inferno .
 Warnings about Parliament 's dilapidated state have been growing louder , and expert say they can no longer be ignored . Chunks of masonry have repeatedly come crashing down from the outside of the building . Earlier this month lawmaker were sent home after water from a burst pipe began gushing into the House of Commons chamber itself .
 `` This is a building that is trying to say something , '' said Caroline Shenton , author of two book on the history of Parliament .
 For Shenton , the scene from Paris brought a sad sense of deja vu . Her book `` The Day Parliament Burned Down '' recount the destruction in 1834 of the current legislative building 's predecessor in one of the biggest blaze London ha ever seen .
 `` I watched the fire spread across the roof of Notre Dame and the scene I described in 'The Day Parliament Burned Down ' came back to me , '' Shenton said . `` The rapid spread . The complete lack of fire protection . The huge crowd gathering — silent , shocked . ''
 Out of the 1834 fire rose the current Parliament building , a neo-Gothic marvel by architect Charles Barry that took 30 year to complete . A UNESCO World Heritage Site , the limestone-clad building ha 1,100 room and almost 3 mile ( 4.8 kilometer ) of corridor .
 And it is being eaten by decay . The roof leak and most of it 4,000 window do n't close properly . Mechanical and electrical system have not been updated since the 1940s . Basements are clogged with century-old steam pipe , bundle of wire and asbestos .
 A report commissioned by Parliamentary authority warned in 2016 that the building wa at risk of a `` catastrophic event '' such a a flood or fire that would leave it uninhabitable .
 Labour Party lawmaker Chris Bryant , part of a committee looking into the restoration of Parliament , warned this week that a fire could cause `` a major loss of life '' because of the challenge of evacuating the labyrinthine structure which house thousand of employee and is visited by 1 million people a year .
 Officials in charge of Parliament 's Restoration and Renewal Program said in a statement that they `` stand ready to learn any lesson that emerge from the fire at Notre Dame to ensure we do everything possible to protect our people and building . ''
 The Parliament building face some of the same risk a Notre Dame . Although built in the 19th century , Parliament incorporates part of more ancient structure . The oldest section , Westminster Hall , is 900 year old and ha a magnificent wood-beamed roof — like Notre Dame .
 Hours after the cathedral 's roof wa consumed by flame , French President Emmanuel Macron declared that it wa France 's destiny to rebuild it .
 Yet , with Brexit consuming all the political oxygen in Britain , there 's no similar sense of national purpose to preserving the Houses of Parliament . Unlike Notre Dame , a place of spiritual succor , Parliament is full of politician , a largely unpopular group .
 Matthew Flinders , a professor of politics at the University of Sheffield , said Britons `` have a great affection for the building '' — but le regard for it occupant .
 Meanwhile , the politician who must make big decision about the building `` are very scared to be seen to be spending large amount of public money '' on themselves .
 `` In many way , the worst people to take decision about the future of the Palace of Westminster are the ( lawmaker ) who are in it today , '' Flinders said .
 In 2018 , after year of wrangling and delay , lawmaker voted to move out for several year so the building can be repaired , but that will not happen until the mid-2020s . It 's estimated the repair will take six year and cost about 3.5 billion pound ( $ 4.6 billion ) , although that figure is likely to rise .
 For now , fire warden patrol the Parliament complex 24 hour a day , alert for small blaze that could spread . Urgently needed repair are being carried out on part of the complex , including it Big Ben tower , whose famous clock is shrouded in scaffolding .
 Repairing and updating such structure brings it own danger . Old building are often at their most vulnerable during construction work . Notre Dame 's roof wa being restored when the fire broke out on Monday .
 David Leakey , who retired a Parliament 's head of security last year , told BBC radio that previous wake-up call had been met by `` prevarication and delay . ''
 `` The question is this : How often are the politician going to hit the snooze button ? '' he asked .

 Critic ’ s Pick
 By Jon Pareles
 Love is a murky , uncertain , only sporadically blissful thing on James Blake ’ s fourth album , “ Assume Form. ” But sometimes it manages to break through his chronic melancholy . He need the changeup , because echo of his own past are his toughest competition .
 Since the release of his self-titled debut album in 2011 , Blake ’ s style ha made a thoroughly improbable conquest of pop ’ s commercial mainstream , seeping into hip-hop , R & B and rock . Beyoncé , Frank Ocean , Kanye West , Kendrick Lamar and Anderson .Paak chose him a a collaborator , and streaming blockbuster like Post Malone , Future and Juice WRLD have clearly learned from his vocabulary of oozy , slow-motion chord , electronically wobbled vocal and transition that crumble and lurch into new configuration .
 Before his debut album , Blake had made a reputation a a club D.J . playing and producing fractured , aggressively disorienting British dubstep track . But “ James Blake ” turned his music radically inward . He constructed ballad around sparse keyboard chord and his sustained , doleful , androgynous voice , hovering in imaginary space and punctuated by tense silence .
 He wa , he told The Guardian in 2016 , “ copying dubstep rhythm but using gospel-tinged , classically tinged keyboard playing. ” But he wa doing more than that . For all his debt to British dubstep and to the moody desolation of hip-hop auteur like RZA ( who wa a guest on Blake ’ s 2013 album , “ Overgrown ” ) , Blake had found a way to create a charged stillness , a forsaken fortress of solitude . His music suited an era of disembodied digital interaction , at once instantaneous and physically distant .
 With “ Assume Form , ” Blake want to get closer . His previous album were suffused with loneliness ; this one , tentatively and almost incredulously , ponders intimacy . In the album ’ s title song , Blake sings about choosing to become embodied : “ I ’ ll leave the ether/I will assume form , ” he croons . “ I will be touchable by her/I will be reachable. ” The track fluctuates gorgeously , juxtaposing loop of piano that are soothing and vaguely ominous , and only settling into a beat about halfway through , like a ghost gradually solidifying .
 [ Never miss a pop music story : Get our weekly newsletter , Louder . ]
 The album is full of gratitude and affectionate apology . “ Into the Red ” marvel at a woman ’ s financial generosity , over a track that dwindles from a string-ensemble arrangement to tiny , plinking tone . “ Can ’ t Believe the Way We Flow , ” built on a rapturous sample from the R & B vocal group the Manhattans and produced with Oneohtrix Point Never , revel in sensuality that make the singer “ waive my fear of self. ” In “ Power On , ” he list his delusion of separateness and self-sufficiency — “ I thought you were second place to every song ” — only to return to a refrain : “ I wa wrong . ”
 Blake rarely let his music feel too secure . He still make pitch waver and rhythm dissolve ; he switch texture with sudden , surreal edits . In two song , he collaborates with the producer Metro Boomin and guest vocalist : Travis Scott in “ Mile High ” and Moses Sumney in “ Tell Them. ” But he calmly destabilizes Metro Boomin ’ s trap rhythm , entangling them with flute sound in “ Mile High ” and fitfully swapping them for flamenco handclap in “ Tell Them. ” Well aware of how widely imitated he is , Blake offer some other surprise ; if it were in a different musical guise , the borderline stalker-ish “ I ’ ll Come Too ” could almost be a Tin Pan Alley ballad .
 Like the rest of Blake ’ s album , “ Assume Form ” open into haunted , rewarding depth . All that ’ s missing is one luminous , fully focused pop chorus , like “ Retrograde ” on Blake ’ s 2013 “ Overgrown ” or “ My Willing Heart ” on his 2016 “ The Colour in Anything. ” This album come closest in “ Barefoot in the Park , ” a duet with the Spanish singer Rosalía that , despite it minor key and somber descending chord , celebrates togetherness and how “ You start rubbing off on me. ” Perhaps Blake couldn ’ t bring himself to write something a clichéd a a hit-seeking pop love song .

 Critic ’ s Notebook
 By Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim
 The pianist Gerald Moore , one of the great accompanist of the 20th century , called his memoir “ Am I Too Loud ? ”
 It ’ s a question member of the New York Philharmonic should ask themselves on a regular basis . Gentlemen of the brass section : I ’ m talking to you . Conductors might want to pull up a chair , too .
 The Philharmonic ’ s sound ha taken on a hard edge , disrupting some of music ’ s most glorious moment . Tutti eruption that felt crude rather than grand blighted the orchestra ’ s two most recent program at David Geffen Hall . On Jan. 3 , Paavo Jarvi led Dvorak ’ s Cello Concerto , a Sibelius tone poem and Ravel ’ s Suite No . 2 from “ Daphnis et Chloé. ” This weekend ’ s program , which opened on Thursday under the direction of Jakub Hrusa , included Prokofiev ’ s Piano Concerto No . 3 and Rimsky-Korsakov ’ s “ Scheherazade . ”
 In both program there wa much to like , even to be thrilled by . The string can be a marvel of cohesion and warmth . Individual solo — of the flutist Robert Langevin in the Ravel , or the concertmaster Frank Huang in “ Scheherazade ” — are exquisitely nuanced . But dynamic peak tend to ring out harshly aggressive , with a sound that ’ s big without being full . Put delicately , fortissimo are not this orchestra ’ s forte .
 In the Dvorak concerto , the cellist Gautier Capuçon battled valiantly to assert himself against an ensemble that seemed intent on belittling him . His tone sounded tight and strained at first , but over the course of the first movement began to glow ; his playing became eloquently assured .
 This is heroic music that build pathos and excitement from the contrast of solo cello and large orchestra playing , yes , fortissimo . But while that Italian term translates a “ loudest , ” brawn should be matched by character . Dvorak mark these moment “ grandioso. ” They should be an exhilarating amplification of the cello-protagonist . Here , the ensemble obliterated him .
 In the hard-driving “ Danse Générale ” that concludes Ravel ’ s suite , there were more sledgehammer moment in which volume swallowed up color and complexity . ( A shame , since the light-dappled opening “ Daybreak ” movement held glimpse of the Philharmonic ’ s playing at it most beguiling . ) And in the start of the Rimsky-Korsakov on Thursday — this movement marked “ maestoso , ” or majestically — the huge brass statement burst out with saber-rattling strength but little majesty .
 The most satisfying part of that evening wa the Prokofiev concerto with the ebullient pianist Simon Trpceski , who gave a performance that encompassed cartoonish humor and hushed lyricism . Mr. Hrusa is a charismatic conductor with a particular knack , evident in “ Scheherazade , ” for minutely shaping a string melody so that an entire section appears to play with the same effortless freedom a a soloist . Mr. Hrusa also managed to husband the dynamic force in the Rimsky-Korsakov so that the most voluminous louds came near the end . But there , once again , the sound lacked the necessary roundness and texture to support the decibel burn .
 As the orchestra adapts to it new music director , Jaap van Zweden , who return to the podium next week , it sound will surely evolve . The ability of a group of musician to produce earth-shattering loudness with purely acoustic mean is one of the joy of classical music , and a selling point in an age in which volume is cheap and controlled by a dial . It ’ s worth getting these fortissimo right .

 It ’ s a scientific coup to warm the heart of any superhero fan : A rare documented sighting of a black panther in Africa , not far from where Marvel place the fictional setting of it Oscar-nominated “ Black Panther . ”
 A team from the Institute for Conservation Research of the San Diego Zoo Global and the Loisaba Conservancy in Kenya confirmed the existence of black leopard — a the animal are also known — in Laikipia County , an area north of Nairobi , Kenya ’ s capital .
 “ It is certain black panther have been there all along , but good footage that could confirm it ha always been absent until now , ” Nicholas Pilfold , a biologist at the San Diego institute , said in an Instagram post on Tuesday .
 “ Black panther are uncommon , only about 11 percent of leopard globally are black , ” he added . “ But black panther in Africa are extremely rare . ”
 The researcher ’ finding were published in the African Journal of Ecology in January .
 The leopard , scientific name Panthera pardus , is more commonly found with a black coat in tropical and humid Southeast Asia . But , apparently , melanism — the cause of the dark coloring — can also be displayed in semiarid climate , like that of Laikipia , according to the paper .
 There have been a few reported observation of this subspecies in Africa , but , until now , only one had been confirmed , in Addis Ababa , the capital of Ethiopia , in 1909 .
 Following unconfirmed report of a black leopard in Laikipia County , the research team installed eight camera around the Laikipia Wilderness Camp — focusing on available water source , such a swimming pool and natural spring , and on animal trail .
 From February to April 2018 , five of the camera recorded footage of a young female black leopard . She appeared alone in four nighttime video — drinking water from artificial water source or carrying remains of her prey — but in the only daytime video , she wa following an adult female leopard with normal marking .
 “ Unconfirmed observation from September 2017 from the two leopard together suggest that this nonmelanistic female might be the mother of the black leopard , ” according to the paper , which added that in previous sighting , the black leopard wa “ smaller in size , and in closer proximity to her mother . ”
 Word of the camera observation brought forth another high-quality image of a black leopard from the Ol Ari Nyiro Conservancy , also in Laikipia , which wa taken in May 2007 .
 “ Collectively , these image are the first reported in nearly 100 year that confirm the existence of black leopard in Africa , and the first in Kenya , ” the paper said .
 The dark coloration of the melanistic leopard ’ coat is attributed to a recessive gene that cause the loss of the normal function . Despite being called black , they are usually very dark brown and have the same pattern of spot a other leopard , according to the Out of Africa Park in Arizona , which host two black leopard , named Enoch and Silhouette .
 But there are also theory suggesting that melanism could have an environmental factor .
 “ Melanism is hypothesized to be an adaptation to environment in which a dark coloration provides camouflage from predator or prey , ” Dr. Pilfold said in the paper .
 Until recently , leopard — reclusive , adaptable , and territorial — were considered to exist in relative abundance .
 But a study published in May 2016 suggested that leopard had lost 75 percent of their range since 1750 . They were then classified a “ vulnerable ” on the Red List of threatened specie of the International Union for Conservation of Nature .
 Three subspecies of the leopard are classified a “ critically endangered , ” and two others a “ endangered . ”
 “ I think the biggest threat to the leopard on a global scale is that it ’ s been just under the radar , ” Philipp Henschel , the lion program survey coordinator for Panthera , a global wild cat conservation organization , told The New York Times in 2016 .
 “ Nobody really cared about the leopard , ” he said , “ because everybody assumed they were really abundant and widespread . ”
 An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to black panther . They are not a distinct specie , but a melanistic color variant of the African leopard subspecies .

 The new Netflix series “ Turn Up Charlie ” get to the heart of Idris Elba , sitting at the intersection of his two passion : deejaying and making heartwarming dramedies that reflect his working-class London origin .
 Wait , what ?
 O.K. , I don ’ t actually know what drive Elba , who created ( with Gary Reich ) and star in “ Turn Up Charlie. ” But despite his action hero persona and style-icon status , there is evidence that his heart isn ’ t entirely in playing unnerving gangster ( Stringer Bell , “ The Wire ” ) , heroic cop ( John Luther , “ Luther ” ) and Asgardian sentry ( Heimdall , Marvel Cinematic Universe ) .
 He ’ s been a working musician for a long a he ’ s been an actor , and find the time to maintain a second career a a D.J. , producer , rapper and singer ; he ’ s scheduled to perform at Coachella next month . That ’ s no hobby .
 And then he squeeze in a third career a the Norman Lear ( or the Mike Leigh , more aptly ) of London ’ s West African immigrant community . He created and wrote the 2018 series “ In the Long Run , ” a kitchen-sink comedy about a family that shared his Sierra Leonean root , before making “ Turn Up Charlie , ” in which he play the title character , an old-school D.J . who ’ s 20 year past his lone hit and too ashamed to tell his parent back in Nigeria that he ’ s a failure .
 The new series take an early turn away from naturalism , though . David ( J. J. Feild ) , a childhood friend of Charlie ’ s who ’ s become a Hollywood star , return to London with his wife , Sara ( Piper Perabo ) , a famous D.J. , so that their 11-year-old daughter , Gabrielle ( Frankie Hervey ) , can settle down and get the kind of British schooling her father too fondly remembers .
 David and Sara ’ s commitment to full-time parenting is only calf-leather deep , however , which lead to the show ’ s echt-sitcom contrivance : They recruit the barely employed Charlie a nanny for their holy terror of a daughter . So : “ Who ’ s the Boss ” with a washed-up British D.J . instead of a washed-up American baseball player .
 And there ’ s a fair measure of the kind of embarrassing sitcommery this premise would lead you to expect . If you can live without seeing Idris Elba saying “ I ’ m adorbs ” to an 11-year-old girl , you can live without “ Turn Up Charlie. ” In addition to being regularly humiliated by the wiseacre child he ha to chase around London and Ibiza , Charlie also ha to endure the put-down of his saucy auntie , Lydia ( Jocelyn Jee Esien ) , who dispenses wisdom about romance to him and parenting to his posh white friend .
 Elba is admirably committed to the drab , sentimental material ( written by Georgia Lester , Victoria Asare-Archer , Laura Neal and Femi Oyeniran ) , and his portrayal is unfailingly gracious and warm . He ’ s a gung-ho , grizzled straight man , readily playing against his superheroic image . ( Although Charlie is still fought over by the lady , and there are some oddly graphic discussion of the size of his cartridge . )
 One problem , though : He ’ s just not funny . Elba ’ s considerable skill in projecting menace and resolve don ’ t come into play and he mostly just look genial and a little lost . With the exception of a few supporting player , like Esien and Guz Khan a Charlie ’ s stoner buddy , that ’ s a problem up and down the call sheet — reasonably talented performer with no aptitude for comedy .
 The casting issue is mitigated , to some extent , by the show ’ s proclivity for mixing lachrymose family drama in with the odd-couple farce . Parents , daughter and nanny all feel neglected and jealous in different degree and direction , a potentially barbed situation that the writer play for mild laugh and greeting-card parable . A couple of episode set on Ibiza make the supposedly debauched party scene look like a weekend fair at a progressive high school .
 It ’ s commendable that an actor whose itinerary includes the next “ Suicide Squad ” film and George Miller ’ s super-buzzy “ Three Thousand Years of Longing ” put his weight behind more plebeian project like “ Turn Up Charlie. ” That said , if you ’ d be interested in an actually funny comedy that incorporates turntablism and London immigrant , the five season of “ People Just Do Nothing ” are available on Netflix .

 Best of Late Night
 By Giovanni Russonello
 Welcome to Best of Late Night , a rundown of the previous night ’ s highlight that let you sleep — and let u get paid to watch comedy . If you ’ re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV , sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendation straight to your inbox .
 Samantha Bee made it clear on Wednesday that she wa happy to see Kirstjen Nielsen go a secretary of homeland security .
 “ Kirstjen is a lying ghoul who enforced policy that tore family apart and impacted thousand of life , ” Bee said in characteristically vitriolic term . “ She deserves to be shunned a hard a disgraced movie mogul and morning show host , ” Bee added , showing photo of Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer .
 But she also worried that President Trump might replace Nielsen — who oversaw the administration ’ s notorious policy of separating migrant family trying to enter the country — with someone even more willing to enforce hard-line border policy . Before her ouster , Nielsen and Trump had been clashing over whether to embrace harsher measure , some of which Nielsen reportedly believed might fall outside the limit of the law .
 “ This weekend Kirstjen Nielsen stepped down a homeland security secretary , presumably to spend more time with her family after a house fell on her sister. ” — SAMANTHA BEE , showing the Wicked Witch of the West ’ s foot after she wa crushed by a house in “ The Wizard of Oz ”
 “ Nielsen ’ s problem is that she care about petty detail like , ‘ Is this illegal , ’ and ‘ Will this accomplish anything , ’ and ‘ Will I be remembered a one of America ’ s greatest monster ? ’ Trump ha no patience for that kind of dithering . He want maximum cruelty and he want it now ! ”
 Nielsen ’ s firing is part of a larger bloodletting at the Department of Homeland Security , where various senior staff member have lost their job in the past week . Bee pointed out that two week ago , the Fox News host Lou Dobbs called on Trump to replace the department ’ s leadership .
 In order to prevent Trump from taking any more advice from Dobbs , Bee said a Good Samaritan ought to help Trump find better thing to do with his weekend than watching Fox News .
 “ That aired two Fridays ago on Dobbs ’ s show , which Trump watch religiously . I ’ m not sure what ’ s sadder : the state of our government or the fact that the president doesn ’ t have one friend to hang out with on weekend . Please , someone , be America ’ s greatest hero and befriend Donald Trump ! ”
 Scientists on Wednesday released the first known photo of a black hole . The image wa blurry , but it clearly showed a fiery rim around a round dark spot .
 “ Scientists this morning revealed the first image of a black hole , which wa apparently taken on an early-2000s Nokia flip phone. ” — SETH MEYERS
 “ Behold , the dark hole ( also what cat owner see when they wake up ) ! ” — STEPHEN COLBERT
 “ It ’ s kind of beautiful , isn ’ t it ? Do you think this is where God keep his weed ? ” — JIMMY KIMMEL
 “ Americans saw that and said , ‘ I have no idea what a black hole is , but I could really go for a glazed donut. ’ ” — JIMMY FALLON
 Senator Bernie Sanders pledged this week to release 10 year of tax return , and he admitted that they would show him to be a newly minted millionaire . Jimmy Fallon joked that the democratic socialist crusader probably feel awkward about his new rich .
 “ Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders say that he ’ s going to release his tax return on Monday , and thanks to his book sale they ’ re actually expected to show that Bernie is now a millionaire . Bernie Sanders is a millionaire ! He ’ s pretty freaked out . He ’ s like , ‘ Oh my God , the 1 percent is coming from inside the house ! I am the 1 percent ! ” — JIMMY FALLON
 “ The guy who ’ s spent his life ranting against millionaire is a millionaire . That ’ s like finding out Smokey the Bear is a pyromaniac . You know what I ’ m saying ? It ’ s like finding out the Hamburglar is a vegan . You know ? It ’ s like Joe Biden telling u he spent 40 year teaching class on workplace harassment. ” — JIMMY FALLON
 Bee marveled at the strange dynamic of Kellyanne and George Conway ’ s marriage .
 Jimmy Kimmel once again became “ Judge James. ” This time he decided the fate of a dog caught up in a custody battle between two former lover .
 Adam Driver , who is starring alongside Keri Russell in the Broadway play “ Burn This , ” will talk to Seth Meyers on Thursday .

 There ’ s no reason for the federal government to profit from access to court document .
 By The Editorial Board
 The editorial board represents the opinion of the board , it editor and the publisher . It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section .
 One bright spot of the Trump era is a greater public understanding of the rule of law and the institution and individual who sustain it .
 But concerned citizen who wish to keep up with court case — not to mention journalist covering them — face a barrier : the byzantine and overly expensive Public Access to Court Electronic Records system , more commonly known a Pacer .
 Pacer , a 30-year-old relic that remains unwieldy to use , is a collection of online portal run by the administrative arm of the federal court system . It wa designed , at least in principle , to provide online access to the more than one billion court document that have been docketed in federal court across the country since the advent of electronic case filing .
 But the public can gain access to these public document online only by paying significant fee . Pacer charge 10 cent per page to view electronic court document — or up to $ 3 for document exceeding 30 page , which are common . It ’ s easy to burn up $ 10 just by looking up rudimentary information about a single case .
 This can translate to significant cost for news outlet . The Times ’ s newsroom ha in recent year paid ten of thousand of dollar in fee for access to federal court document . Such cost can be a burden on smaller newsroom , many of which have struggled financially in recent year .
 As Adam Liptak , the longtime Supreme Court correspondent for The Times , noted this week , Pacer ’ s fee structure is “ preposterous . ”
 It may be unlawful , too . The E-Government Act of 2002 say that court may impose fee “ only to the extent necessary ” to make public record available . That phrase is now at the center of a class-action lawsuit brought by nonprofit advocacy group . The group are challenging the fee structure of the Pacer system , which in 2016 took in $ 146 million , despite costing only a small fraction of that to operate . The litigation ha revealed that the federal court system us the surplus to fund expenditure — such a courtroom technology and court notice to law enforcement agency — that have nothing to do with enhancing public access or understanding of how the justice system work . The plaintiff are asking that the government not “ exceed the expense actually incurred in providing record upon request . ”
 Ruling against the government in the case , a Federal District Court judge last year marveled at this misuse of Pacer fee . “ The court doe not see how flat-screen TVs for juror or those seated in the courtroom , which are used to display exhibit or other evidence during a court proceeding , fall within the statute , ” the judge , Ellen Segal Huvelle , wrote .
 That ruling is now on appeal . A chorus of advocate — medium organization , former judge , First Amendment group , legal research technologist and former Senator Joe Lieberman , an original sponsor of the E-Government Act — have jumped into the dispute and sounded off on Pacer ’ s fee .
 There ’ s also an admirable bill that wa introduced last year in Congress , the Electronic Court Records Reform Act , that go a step further than what is being sought in the class-action suit . It would make all document filed with the federal court available free to the public . ( In 2017 , the Supreme Court , often a late adopter of new technology , made virtually all of it new court filing freely available online . ) The legislation also would mandate needed update to Pacer , including making document text-searchable and linkable from external website .
 These advancement would help ensure that the justice system is more transparent to all .
 The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letter to the editor . We ’ d like to hear what you think about this or any of our article . Here are some tip . And here ’ s our email : letter @ nytimes.com .

 HOUSE OF STONE By Novuyo Rosa Tshuma
 Zamani , the narrator of Novuyo Rosa Tshuma ’ s remarkable first novel , “ House of Stone , ” ha a troubled relationship with the past . For him there is history , and then there is “ hi-story , ” a subtle but important distinction for a man who want more than the incomplete , fragmentary tale his uncle passed on to him before dying .
 As an orphan born in the violent aftermath of Zimbabwe ’ s war for independence , Zamani see the past a riddled with loss and impossible-to-bear gap and silence that he must “ powder away ” in order to reinvent himself .
 The path Zamani take a he construct a new “ hi-story ” is a circuitous one . If he were an ordinary narrator , he would most likely mine and interrogate memory and photograph to construct the narrative he want . Zamani , however , is anything but ordinary ; when we first meet him he ha already woven himself into the fabric of another family , the Mlambos , whose son , Bukhosi , ha mysteriously disappeared .
 Zamani life on the Mlambos ’ property a a lodger in what he refers to a a “ pygmy room. ” Following Bukhosi ’ s disappearance he draw closer to the grieving parent , Abednego and Mamma Agnes , perversely referring to them a his surrogate mother and father and doing his best to fill the void left by their missing son . And yet , to be more than just a lodger Zamani need intimate access to Abednego and Mamma Agnes ’ s past , from their childhood memory of colonial Rhodesia to the buried , unspoken tragedy of their life during Gukurahundi — the post-independence strategy of ethnic cleansing that began under President Robert Mugabe .
 Gaining access to that history of profound loss is far from easy . The past is reluctant to give up it ghost , so Zamani must coax them out , first from Abednego and later from Mamma Agnes . He doe so through subtle manipulation and , when that isn ’ t enough , force and ultimately fear .
 In one of the novel ’ s more haunting scene , Zamani , in order to learn more of his surrogate father ’ s life , pours glass after glass down the recovering alcoholic ’ s throat , nearly drowning him in Scotch . With Abednego all but passed out , Zamani lean in close for a selfie . It ’ s torture masquerading a affection and belongs a much to the brutal “ fact-finding ” method of the colonial and postcolonial era a to our own era of state-sanctioned violence .
 Zamani ’ s action and ambition carry an obviously colonial overtone . Zamani , however , is too rich and complicated a character to be reduced to any single metaphor or symbol .
 He is elusive and conniving , earnest and manipulative , brutal and desperate . In his excess , he ha more in common with Saleem Sinai , the narrator of Salman Rushdie ’ s classic “ Midnight ’ s Children , ” than he doe with the orphan Pip of “ Great Expectations. ” He refers to Wittgenstein on history and in his usurpation of fact and story resembles Charles Kinbote in Vladimir Nabokov ’ s “ Pale Fire . ”
 Tshuma ’ s brilliant layering of competing image and metaphor is one of the many marvel of this wise and demanding novel . While Zamani may claim , over and over , that what he ’ s seeking is a full accounting of history at the most intimate level , the story that are slowly and painfully revealed suggest that something far more complicated is at work .
 Zamani , like Zimbabwe , is a product not only of independence but of the Gukurahundi massacre and the decade of cover-up that followed . We remember the liberation a heroic and say little to nothing about the dead left in it wake . Throughout this stunning novel a single question is repeated by the ghost of the missing Bukhosi : What happened ?
 Tshuma ’ s novel give a devastating answer to that question , but it doe much more than that . Zamani ’ s radical retelling of the past is a sublime performance of narrative possibility — presented with an excess of love and violence that at time is almost too much to bear . As Zamani extract the past , he bend and manipulates it for his own need . He consumes the private history of Abednego and Mamma Agnes , leaving a trail of devastation behind him .
 It ’ s a remarkable feat . Through Zamani , Tshuma show u how much work it take to efface the past , and , through “ House of Stone , ” she prof that those effort are no match for a novel a ambitious and ingenious a this one .
 Dinaw Mengestu is the author , most recently , of the novel “ All Our Names . ”

 With the closing of a Blockbuster store in Australia , the one in Bend , Ore. , will be the last to survive change in technology and shopping that reshaped the way people watch movie at home .
 By Tiffany Hsu
 Fifteen year ago , a movie fan could go into any of Blockbuster ’ s 9,000 store and walk out with a Steven Spielberg hit .
 Now , option are limited for those who want to rent a hard copy of “ Saving Private Ryan ” from somewhere other than a library . There are only two Blockbuster store left in the world . Very soon , there will only be one .
 The second-to-last Blockbuster , a squat blue-and-yellow slab wedged next to a real estate agency in Western Australia , will stop renting video on Thursday and shut down for good at the end of the month . Two store in Alaska , part of the final group of Blockbuster outlet in the United States , closed in July .
 That will make the Blockbuster in Bend , Ore. , one of a kind : a corporate remnant , just off the highway , near a cannabis retailer and a pet cremation service .
 [ Share your memory of Blockbuster in our comment section . ]
 But this is no elegy for Blockbuster , no lament for how Netflix killed the video star . There were plenty of those when the company filed for bankruptcy protection in 2010 , shriveled to 300 store and then mostly closed .
 This is about the ability of the Bend store , like sturdy link in other dying chain , to live on and avoid being turned into a pawnshop or a fast-food restaurant .
 Some Tower Records store still thrive in Japan long after their parent company declared bankruptcy and closed all of it American store . There is a Howard Johnson ’ s in Lake George , N.Y. , that is the lone survivor of what wa once the country ’ s largest restaurant chain .
 Such holdout have bucked the norm in the retail and restaurant industry , which have shed store by the hundred in recent year .
 The roll call of closing continued Wednesday , with the discount retailer Dollar Tree ’ s announcement that it would close up to 390 Family Dollar location this year . As of mid-February , retailer had announced 2,187 store closing in the United States this year , according to Coresight Research .
 But when Sandi Harding , the general manager of Bend ’ s Blockbuster store , heard that she would be running what is effectively the Lonesome George of video-rental chain , she posted a giddy message on Facebook : “ Holy Cow it ’ s exciting ”
 Blockbuster is such a throwback to another time that the trailer for “ Captain Marvel , ” which is set during the 1990s , open with the title character crashing through the roof of one of it store .
 The Bend store became a Blockbuster franchise in 2000 . It ha about 4,000 active account and sign up a few fresh one each day , Ms. Harding said . Some of the new customer are tourist who have traveled hour out of their way to stop in .
 Several call to the store ’ s landline on Wednesday were greeted by a steady busy signal or hold music ( the “ Star Wars ” theme ) . On sale inside wa Blockbuster-branded merchandise , including trucker hat , cup , even magnet made by a local teacher .
 The store ha several year left on it lease and a license agreement that it owner sign annually with Dish Network , which bought Blockbuster for $ 320 million in 2011 .
 “ It ’ s almost re-energized u , that we ’ re the last one , ” Ms. Harding said in an interview . “ They treat u like celebrity . ”
 A local beer maker , 10 Barrel Brewing , crafted a special beer , the Last Blockbuster , and served it at a party at the store . Two filmmaker raised nearly $ 40,000 on Kickstarter to finish a documentary about the location .
 One possible explanation for the store ’ s long life : Bend is in a region that the city ’ s mayor , Sally Russell , describes a having “ huge expanse with really small community ” that often do not have easy access to the high-speed internet necessary for content streaming .
 Many resident of outlying area stop at Blockbuster during their weekly trip to town to run errand , drawn in part by the store ’ s seven-day rental policy , Ms. Russell said , adding that the store ’ s last-in-the-world status could even give it a lift .
 “ It ’ s like with old vinyl , and how everyone want to have turntable again , ” she said . “ We get to a place where something out of date come back in — there ’ s definitely interest in keeping this almost-extinct way of enjoying movie alive . ”

 Best of Late Night
 By Giovanni Russonello
 Welcome to Best of Late Night , a rundown of the previous night ’ s highlight that let you sleep — and let u get paid to watch comedy . If you ’ re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV , sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendation straight to your inbox .
 Stephen Colbert returned from a weeklong break on Monday and dove into a takedown of President Trump ’ s rambling speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Saturday .
 It wa a historically long speech — but it most memorable moment may have come at the very beginning , when Trump shared a long , very tender embrace with an American flag onstage .
 “ He talked for two hour and two minute , making it ‘ the longest presidential oration in American history. ’ Which is impressive , because some of Obama ’ s pause were almost an hour. ” — STEPHEN COLBERT , quoting from an article in The Atlantic
 “ He is dry humping Old Glory ! I believe that is the first time a flag ha ever volunteered to be burned . Just full Kevorkian. ” — STEPHEN COLBERT
 Jimmy Kimmel made fun of the entire conference , which gather many of the major player in conservative politics but particularly those on the far right .
 “ CPAC , if you ’ re not familiar , is basically what would happen if Judge Jeanine Pirro headlined the Fyre Festival . It ’ s a lot of very angry white people. ” — JIMMY KIMMEL
 “ It is the largest gathering of people who believe vaccine are witchcraft in the world. ” — JIMMY KIMMEL
 Kimmel said he wasn ’ t impressed with the official name of the winter storm that swept the country over the weekend .
 “ We ’ re sending warm wish to those of you who are digging your way out of Winter Storm Scott . Why ’ d they name a storm ‘ Scott ’ ? I really don ’ t know . Probably someone at the Weather Channel forgot to get their nephew a birthday present. ” — JIMMY KIMMEL
 “ When I hear Scott , I think of a co-worker who us the microwave to heat fish . Scott isn ’ t a storm name. ” — JIMMY KIMMEL
 “ Scott ’ s the name of your mom ’ s new boyfriend , not a storm. ” — JIMMY KIMMEL
 Colbert wa on vacation last week , so he missed Michael Cohen ’ s congressional testimony — one of the biggest moment in the investigation into Trump ’ s tie to Russia and his activity on the 2016 campaign trail .
 Colbert zeroed in on a moment when Cohen described talking to the first lady , Melania Trump , on the president ’ s behalf about his reported affair with the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels .
 “ Always the sign of a healthy relationship . [ impersonating Trump ] ‘ Babe , I never cheated on you . Now , I would prefer any further question about my affection and my loyalty go to my lawyer , who ha prepared a signed affidavit attesting that I love you. ’ ” — STEPHEN COLBERT
 To put thing right in the world , James Corden and the comedian Reggie Watts traveled to Thailand ( and New Jersey ) and reunited the Jonas Brothers . Or something . ( Spoiler : They probably would have reunited anyway . In any case , they ’ ll be on Corden ’ s show all week . )
 According to the comedian Colin Quinn , Florida ’ s problem is simply that it peaked too early . And he doesn ’ t think much of the United States at large , either . “ This country , ” he said , “ wa just a nice way to pas time until we die . ”
 Samuel L. Jackson — whose current movie is “ Captain Marvel ” — will return to “ Jimmy Kimmel Live ” on Tuesday .
 Looking for something to watch on Tuesday evening ? Our pick for the day ’ s TV highlight include the season premiere of “ The Story of God With Morgan Freeman ” on National Geographic and “ The Bachelor : The Women Tell All , ” a two-hour special on ABC .

 Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina probably didn ’ t need to cheat to win re-election . So why did she ?
 By The Editorial Board
 The editorial board represents the opinion of the board , it editor and the publisher . It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section .
 Sheikh Hasina ha done marvel for Bangladesh over nearly 10 consecutive year a prime minister . Per-capita income in what wa one of the poorest and least developed country in the world ha grown by nearly 150 percent , and the proportion of the population living in extreme poverty ha dropped from 19 percent to about 9 percent . All the greater the pity that her achievement have been offset by a precipitous slide toward authoritarianism and an election in which Mrs. Hasina ’ s party won 288 of the 300 contested seat in Parliament , a preposterous 96 percent rate of victory .
 In the week and month before the Dec. 30 vote , local and international human right organization chronicled a relentless campaign of intimidation , ranging from violence and arrest of opposition candidate and protester to surveillance and a draconian digital security law that includes prison term for posting “ aggressive or frightening ” content . At least 17 people died in campaign violence . A Human Rights Watch report described “ a climate of fear extending from prominent voice in society to ordinary citizen , ” without any interference by an intimidated judiciary or election commission .
 In an interview with The Times in December , the prime minister appeared to share the delusion of autocrat everywhere that human right concern were peripheral to a developing country ’ s economic growth . “ If I can provide food , job and health care , that is human right , ” she said . “ What the opposition is saying , or civil society or your NGO ’ s — I don ’ t bother with that . I know my country , and I know how to develop my country . ”
 No one would question that Mrs. Hasina , who is 71 , know her country . Her father , Sheikh Mujibur Rahman , wa the first president of Bangladesh . She wa abroad when he wa assassinated in 1975 , and she returned in 1981 to take over the leadership of the Awami League , which she ha held ever since . Her party and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party , led by another powerful woman , Khaleda Zia , took turn in power until the last election , in 2014 , which the opposition party boycotted to protest change to electoral procedure , giving Mrs. Hasina an uncontested new term . Mrs. Zia wa jailed for corruption last year , and Mrs. Hasina is back for another term at the head of what ha effectively become a one-party state , ready to further tighten control .
 But why ? Why produce nonsensical election result when poll indicated that Mrs. Hasina would likely have won a fair election handily ? Mrs. Hasina ’ s every achievement will now be tainted by her authoritarian method and repressive measure ; her critic , driven into exile or underground , will become only more strident , and her foreign supporter more wary .
 The State Department , noting that the United States is Bangladesh ’ s largest foreign investor and largest single-country market , expressed concern about “ credible report of harassment , intimidation and violence ” during the campaign and urged the election commission to work with all side to address them . The European Union similarly called on Bangladesh to investigate the violence and “ significant obstacle ” that had “ tainted ” the campaign and the vote .
 Given Mrs. Hasina ’ s political and personal trajectory , she is unlikely to be moved by such admonition . But it is incumbent on country doing business with Bangladesh and cheering it rise from poverty to remind her and her ally at every turn that human right are not an imposition of an alien culture , but a critical element of development and progress .

 WASHINGTON — The new Democratic leadership of the House Veterans ’ Affairs Committee said Friday that it would investigate the influence exerted by three member of President Trump ’ s Florida beach club on the Department of Veterans Affairs .
 The move wa viewed a an early , and powerful , indication that the committee , which ha always been known a among the most bipartisan on Capitol Hill , could adopt a harder edge under the new Congress a empowered Democrats move to scrutinize the administration .
 The investigation wa announced in a letter to Robert Wilkie , the secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs , from Representative Mark Takano , Democrat of California , the new chairman of the committee . Mr. Takano requested document and “ information about alleged improper influence ” of the member , Isaac Perlmutter , Bruce Moskowitz and Marc Sherman , “ over policy and personnel decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs . ”
 Mr. Takano said the three men exerted inappropriate influence over procurement at the sprawling department .
 Mr. Perlmutter is the former chief executive of Marvel Entertainment , Mr. Sherman is a lawyer and Dr. Moskowitz is a doctor . The three do not posse special expertise in veteran health care issue , but were reported to be influential over Trump administration policy , including it plan to push the department ’ s health care system toward private provider . The three are frequently at Mar-a-Lago , Mr. Trump ’ s private club in Palm Beach , Fla .
 According to a report last year by the nonprofit investigative news organization ProPublica , the three pressured Mr. Trump ’ s first veteran secretary , David J. Shulkin , then peppered him with demand before ultimately working with personnel in the department to oust him . The group also pushed — in most case , unsuccessfully — for certain vendor to manage health care record , and had a direct line to the president .
 “ I think most Americans would agree that wealthy private citizen should not be having back-channel influence ” on veteran service , Mr. Takano said in an interview Friday . He said that he could use his subpoena power a a “ last resort ” if the requested document were not relinquished . “ This doesn ’ t have to be a drama , ” he said . “ It is a legitimate request . ”
 The three men released a joint statement in response to the committee action .
 “ We were asked by the president and , repeatedly , by the former secretary and his senior staff to assist the V.A . in enhancing the level of service it provides to our veteran , ” the statement said . “ Our primary focus wa to introduce the V.A . to expert in various area where V.A . staff asked for our help . We do not regret trying to do our small part , and even given the unjust and unrelenting criticism we have faced , each of u would step in to help our veteran again . ”
 A spokesman for the new veteran secretary said he rebuffed outside pressure of the kind ascribed to the three men .
 “ Although his predecessor may have done thing differently , Secretary Wilkie ha been clear about how he doe business , ” the spokesman , Curt Cashour , said in an email . “ No one from outside the administration dictate V.A . policy or decision — that ’ s up to Secretary Wilkie and President Trump . Period . ”
 People who speak regularly with Mr. Wilkie say he ha moved to keep the three men at arm ’ s length since taking over the department , but it is unclear what influence they may continue to have over Mr. Trump . Mr. Takano ’ s interest appeared to be focused on event predating Mr. Wilkie ’ s arrival at the department .
 This week , though , eight high-ranking Republicans and Democrats wrote a letter to Mr. Wilkie imploring him to “ be more open , transparent , complete and candid when engaging with Congress in the critical implementation stage of these program . ”
 But Republicans , who lost their majority in the House in midterm election last year , were hoping that the committee would continue to focus on bipartisan legislation and oversight of the agency on issue they agree need attention , like how it managed the new G.I . Bill and change to the health care system .
 “ That ’ s a waste of time , ” Representative Phil Roe of Tennessee , the highest-ranking Republican on the committee , said in an interview last week about the group . “ If they go big on that , it won ’ t be good . ”
 Some Democrats said they were also concerned that the committee might lean too far into their investigative function for a panel with extensive responsibility .
 “ We ’ ve got to do our oversight , ” said Representative Peter Welch , Democrat of Vermont . “ But what we have to be careful of is over-reading our victory . I would recommend coming out of the gate with something that ’ s good for veteran . ”
 The House on Friday passed a child care bill to help family of veteran .

 The Carpetbagger
 By Kyle Buchanan
 Part of the fun of the annual Oscar nominee ’ luncheon is seeing who ’ s talking to whom .
 At one point during Monday ’ s event , Bradley Cooper wa huddled in deep conversation with Spike Lee , while across the ballroom at the Beverly Hilton , Glenn Close made a beeline for Sam Elliott , affectionately dubbing him “ my husband in another life . ”
 And where else but at a gathering of Oscar nominee would you find the Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige , the ballcap-clad producer of “ Black Panther , ” flanked on one side by Lady Gaga and on the other by the Japanese auteur Hirokazu Kore-eda ?
 “ This is surreal , ” said Melissa Berton , surveying the starry scene . Though she wa a producer of the Oscar-nominated documentary short “ Period . End of Sentence , ” Berton primarily work a a high school English teacher , the sort of vocation that rarely lead to a Beverly Hills ballroom . “ I ’ m used to student and white board , ” she said a the “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” star Rami Malek swanned past u .
 Though it ’ s been reported that the academy may relegate category like Berton ’ s to commercial break and then edit those winner into a clip package shown later in the Oscar telecast , the nominee ’ luncheon is more egalitarian .
 [ Fill out your Oscar ballot here . ]
 Viggo Mortensen , up for best actor for “ Green Book , ” wa seated a far back in the room a a table full of sound-mixing nominee . Later in the afternoon , all the nominated guest assembled on row of riser to take a “ class photo , ” offering the rare opportunity for a visual-effects artist to pose alongside star like Amy Adams and Rachel Weisz .
 “ I had to buy a suit for this , because I ’ m usually down in the mud with a camera in my hand , ” said Skye Fitzgerald , who directed the Oscar-nominated documentary short “ Lifeboat. ” Like Close , he had also sought out Elliott , and their encounter left Fitzgerald beaming .
 “ I said , ‘ I admire your work so much , thank you for talking to me , ’ ” Fitzgerald recalled . “ He responded , ‘ You ’ re here , and you ’ re a star. ’ He literally grabbed my shoulder and hugged me ! ” Fitzgerald grinned , patting the same shoulder . “ That ’ s who I hoped he ’ d be , ” he said .
 Some nominee were more skeptical of all the pomp and circumstance . Your Carpetbagger wa seated next to Su Kim , a producer of the Oscar-nominated documentary “ Hale County This Morning , This Evening , ” who told me that her husband had declined to be her plus-one . “ I ’ m really uncomfortable at thing like this , so I get it , ” she said .
 Over salad and salmon , we talked about deep-pocketed company like Netflix and Hulu that had been flooding the documentary space in the hope of gaining an Oscar foothold . While their money can create more opportunity for filmmaker , Kim worried that it might also limit their creative control .
 For those reason she wa still mulling whether she would accept an invitation to join the academy ’ s documentary branch , if asked . “ But I wa talking to a colleague of mine who is a member , ” Kim said , “ and she said , ‘ How do you think anything is going to change if you don ’ t join ? ’ ”
 And even Kim can recognize the strange power of award season . When “ Hale County ” triumphed at the Gotham Awards in November , she broke her high heel : “ I didn ’ t expect to win , and I got so excited that I put a little too much pressure on my shoe. ” She still recall how stunned she wa when “ Hale County ” wa read in the list of Oscar nominee last month .
 “ I thought I wa not hearing thing right , ” Kim said . Then she got a congratulatory text message from a friend she hadn ’ t talked to in year , and the enormity of that moment finally hit her : “ I looked at the phone and thought , ‘ Oh my God , it ’ s real . He saw it , too . ’ ”

 Past Tense
 On the actor ’ s 92nd birthday , photo from early in his career show how he elegantly carried “ the terrific burden ” of the hope and aspiration of an entire people .

 As Sidney Poitier turn 92 today , we were inspired to check our archive , which we call the morgue , to help u illustrate how the storied actor ’ s successful career in Hollywood paved the way for other black actor in the film industry .
 Photos from a shoot with the New York Times photographer Sam Falk reflect the heavy weight of racial significance that ha borne down on Mr. Poitier and the character he ha played .
 Slide after slide show him in casual stance , sticking his hand in his pocket or propping his foot on a fire hydrant , but his expression is resolute , hardly shifting from one photo to the next , except for a slight smile he offer in one frame .
 The meaning behind his seemingly unfaltering countenance is reflected in his word . In Times article over the year , he describes feeling the heft of his career move , in one instance saying that he turned down offer to play subservient character , like butler , because he rejected how Hollywood stereotyped his race .
 “ I felt very much a if I were representing 15 , 18 million people with every move I made , ” he once wrote .
 Born on Feb. 20 , 1927 , Mr. Poitier had only a year and a half of schooling . He moved at a young age to Miami , where he began working to support himself .
 “ Bigotry — and poverty — were Poitier ’ s lot in youth , ” The Times wrote in 1959 .
 His first audition with the American Negro Theatre went poorly . He struggled to read the script , and his West Indian accent made him difficult to understand . So he bought a radio and spent hour at a time listening to the voice and training himself to enunciate word clearly . He also studied newspaper and magazine and taught himself to read .
 Ultimately , he wa hired by the theater .
 Read the article here .
 Mr. Poitier , won an Oscar for best film acting in “ Lilies of the Field . ”
 “ I guess I leaped six foot from my seat when my name wa called . You can call that surprise if you want to , ” he told The Times in 1964 with a relaxed chuckle .
 In speaking about how he got to what The Times called “ the pinnacle of stardom , ” he said :
 “ I have always thought of survival in term of my internal self . That is more important than external self . I wanted to be , in my own term , worthwhile . I wanted to be acceptable to myself . And I felt that way in acting . ”
 Read the article here .
 Twenty-five year later , Mr. Poitier looked back at how his career had progressed .
 By 1989 , his film character included the streetwise student of “ The Blackboard Jungle , ” the proper , collected schoolteacher of “ To Sir , With Love , ” the restless , frustrated Walter Lee Younger of “ A Raisin in the Sun ” ( a role he created on Broadway ) and the methodical but outspoken detective Virgil Tibbs of “ In the Heat of the Night . ”
 “ The most memorable and enduring of those role embodied the experience of many black Americans : an abiding faith in the country ’ s institution , coupled with frustration and anger directed at those same institution , ” The Times wrote .
 “ Historical circumstance have changed , ” Mr. Poitier said . “ During the period when I wa the only person here — no Bill Cosby , no Eddie Murphy , no Denzel Washington — I wa carrying the hope and aspiration of an entire people . I had no control over content , no creative leverage except to refuse to do a film , which I often did . ”
 “ I had to satisfy the action fan , the romantic fan , the intellectual fan . It wa a terrific burden . ”
 Read the article here .
 The New York Times Magazine marveled at Mr. Poitier ’ s diet — at age 73 , he had sworn off alcohol , red meat , milk and sugar , referring to an occasional scoop of ice cream a “ falling off the wagon . ”
 The Times wrote : “ He is 6-foot-3 , 200 pound , trim , fit and still smiling the incandescent smile that started his career five decade ago . ”
 Read the article here .
 An earlier version of a photo caption with this article misstated where the photo wa taken . It wa outside the Apollo Theatre in Midtown , not the Apollo Theater in Harlem . The article also misstated Mr. Poitier ’ s age in 1964 . He wa 37 , not 40 .

 A new FX series recreates the professional and personal relationship between Bob Fosse and Gwen Verdon . Here are some of the onscreen highlight from their career .
 By Aisha Harris
 The dynamic professional and romantic relationship between Bob Fosse and Gwen Verdon ha been dramatized in “ Fosse/Verdon , ” an FX series having it premiere on Tuesday and starring Sam Rockwell and Michelle Williams .
 It might just leave you scrambling to revisit — or discover for the first time — the brilliance of their work on screen : the exuberance , the precision , the sex , the oft droll humor . Fosse and Verdon collaborated across multiple entertainment medium , so there are plenty of piece to choose from . Here are some of the best .
 [ The why and how of Fosse/Verdon dance move . ]
 Stream it on Vimeo .
 Many of the move in “ Single Ladies ( Put a Ring on It ) ” bear a striking resemblance to this number , which Verdon and two dancer performed on “ The Ed Sullivan Show . ”
 Highlights : The casual head bob ; the high kick ( so many ! ) done with such ease . But Beyoncé isn ’ t the only huge pop star to have borrowed from Fosse …
 Rent or purchase it on Amazon .
 In a rare later-in-life onscreen performance , Fosse played the Snake in this musical adaptation of the French , pseudo-children ’ s novella .
 Highlights : His neck isolation , soft-shoe footwork and the all-black ensemble are an obvious inspiration for Michael Jackson ’ s signature move , a ha been noted for year . And Fosse truly had a thing for hat …
 Purchase it on Amazon .
 More hat ! And a song about … doing the mambo and feeling sick ? The lyric are nonsensical , but the rare image of Fosse and Verdon dancing together on screen is irresistible .
 Highlights : The furious footwork and pure joy that come across . But the real highlight of “ Damn Yankees ” is definitely …
 A striptease that ’ s a weird a it is sexy — maybe even more so ? But that ’ s why it work ; Verdon is completely game to lean hard into the playful nature of old-school burlesque a filtered through Fosse ’ s precise choreography .
 Highlights : Verdon ’ s signature , nasally vocal , which are a expressive a her move ; the manic , cartoonish baby step during the break . Seduction wa a common theme in Fosse ’ s piece …
 Stream it on Amazon Prime .
 The dancer and choreographer Ann Reinking , another collaborator ( and romantic partner ) of Fosse ’ s , ha described the characterization of the dance hostess like so : “ From the waist up you ’ re glamorous , you ’ re wonderful . But from the waist down , you ’ re tired and your leg are busted and your foot hurt. ” You can feel it seep through the dancer ’ slinky body ; much of this number actually involves intense stillness .
 Highlights : The overemphasized , mesmerizing isolated movement , which you can also find in …
 A stunning three-act caricature of the elegant upper class trying to be hip like the kid . According to Sam Wasson ’ s comprehensive biography “ Fosse ” — the basis of “ Fosse/Verdon ” — the “ Aloof ” section wa inspired by Arthur , a Mod-themed New York nightclub that catered to the like of John Wayne and Jacqueline Kennedy .
 Highlights : The stoic face and go-go inspired choreography , which demonstrate the 30-something Fosse ’ s willingness to engage with the trend of the time and make it his own , not unlike …
 Stream it on YouTube .
 The entire hourlong concert special is highlight after highlight , but this number , a cover of a song by soul singer-songwriter Joe Tex , stand out . In a hot red mini-dress and flanked by two male dancer , Minnelli command the stage with Fosse ’ s delightfully herky-jerky choreography .
 Highlights : The backup dancer , who are for some reason wearing wide-brimmed hat , white ruffled tuxedo shirt and what look like riding boot . Fosse wa excellent at envisioning movement for trio , a also seen in …
 Purchase it on Amazon .
 So much signature Fosse styling is in this number , including the hat-as-prop , slouched frame , shoulder roll . And even if the song ha no real bearing on the plot of “ The Pajama Game ” it will burrow itself in your brain .
 Highlights : Carol Haney , Buzz Miller and Kenneth LeRoy effortlessly dancing the contrast between tight , syncopated movement and bigger , more fluid one bursting with energy , kind of like …
 Rent or purchase it on Amazon .
 The visual emphasis is on the long line of Minnelli ’ s body and her dancer ’ , the deeply arched back , the extended and accentuated leg and arm .
 Highlights : Minnelli ’ s utter commitment and ease with the chair work ; the dark , smoky aesthetic of the cabaret , which Fosse would return to for …
 Purchase it on Amazon .
 What start off a a number that sound like it could have been plucked straight from “ A Chorus Line ” take a turn for the bizarrely tantalizing . An aviation theme is envisioned via an erotic lens , a Fosse imago a balletic orgy of sort . It ’ s strange , but the dancing is a marvel .
 Highlights : The classic Fosse language in the first part — the hat , glove , the tableau moving in sync .
 Want more Verdon and Fosse ? Other notable work include the jazzy duet “ Nowadays/Hot Honey Rag ” ; the Charlie Chaplin-esque “ Erbie Ferbie ’ s Twitch ” ; and the joyous , playful “ Alley Dance . ”
 An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of one of Bob Fosse 's collaborator . It is Ann Reinking , not Anne Reinking .

 • Colombia abre investigación contra uno de los fiscales encargados de implementar la paz . Carlos Julián Bermeo , fiscal investigador de la Jurisdicción Especial para la Paz ( JEP ) , fue imputado ayer junto con el exsenador Luis Alberto Gil y otras cuatro persona por presuntamente recibir 500.000 dólares a cambio de interferir en el proceso de extradición del exguerrillero Jesús Santrich , acusado de narcotráfico después de que la Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia acordaran abandonar la armas y el tráfico de drogas al firmar la paz en 2016 . A Bermeo , quien fue arrestado el viernes pasado , ayer le fue retirado el cargo en la JEP .
 • Una ‘ pequeña victoria ’ para la oposición venezolana . El líder opositor Juan Guaidó calificó así su retorno al país después de una semana fuera , pues no fue detenido en el aeropuerto pese a que salió de territorio venezolano cuando recae sobre él una prohibición de viaje . Guaidó , quien se juramentó presidente encargado en enero y afirma que Nicolás Maduro e un usurpador , aseguró durante una movilización en Caracas a su regreso que alrededor de setecientos militares han cambiado de bando y respaldado a la oposición en su intento por sacar a Maduro del poder .
 Maduro asumió un nuevo mandato a principios de enero a pesar de que la elecciones recibieron críticas de parcialidad de varios países latinoamericanos y europeos , así como de Estados Unidos y de la Organización de Estados Americanos , que ahora han reconocido a Guaidó como líder legítimo del país .
 • Estados Unidos endurece su embargo comercial a Cuba . El gobierno de Donald Trump anunció ayer que comenzará a aplicar , por primera vez desde que Estados Unidos estableció el embargo contra Cuba en 1960 , un apartado para que empresarios y compañías puedan demandar en la isla por la propiedades que hayan sido confiscadas después de la Revolución , que este año cumple su sesenta aniversario . La llamada Ley Helms-Burton existe desde 1996 , pero los presidentes anteriores a Trump habían suspendido su aplicación ya que implicaría que varias empresas pasen años en litigios .
 “ Hay do candidatos excluyentes : Mauricio Macri , Cristina Fernández de Kirchner . Todas la encuestas muestran que más de la mitad de los argentinos no quiere votar a Macri . Y que más de la mitad —otros , los mismos— de los argentinos no quiere votar a Fernández . Más allá de odios particulares o prejuicios varios , no hay duda de que los do se ganaron ese rechazo con cuidadosas gestiones de gobierno ” .
 El escritor y periodista Martín Caparrós describe por qué la próximas elecciones en Argentina son la muestra clara de “ un liderazgo roto ” con el actual presidente , Macri , y su antecesora y probable rival electoral , Fernández de Kirchner .
 Háganse a un lado , perros y gatos : la mascotas populares en redes ahora son la zarigüeyas , mapaches y mofetas [ en inglés ] . Una de la seguidoras de la comadreja Starfish explica el atractivo : “ Todos no vemos reflejados en un animal que solo quiere comer y husmear entre la basura . No más animales esponjosos : queremos los raros , los que fueron descartados por la sociedad ” .
 • Los legisladores demócratas abren una investigación oficial contra Trump . Los integrantes demócratas de la comisiones de Inteligencia , Relaciones Exteriores y Supervisión en la Cámara de Representantes estadounidense enviaron ayer solicitude de información a diversas agencias del gobierno después de iniciar formalmente una investigación sobre si el presidente Donald Trump ha obstruido la justicia [ en inglés ] . En particular , pidieron datos sobre la comunicaciones de Trump con el presidente ruso , Vladimir Putin ; varios integrantes del equipo de campaña del ahora mandatario están en juicio o han sido imputados por sus vínculos con Rusia y algunos demócratas creen que Trump intentó frenar esos casos judiciales .
 • Una sola palabra que ha resultado muy conflictiva en España . El país europeo está en el punto muerto de una crisis política debido al impacto que ha tenido el movimiento independentista catalán en la política nacional ; el presidente Pedro Sánchez , por ejemplo , tuvo que convocar elecciones anticipadas para finale de abril porque su coalición se desmoronó debido al desencanto de parlamentarios de Cataluña . Y puede que buena parte del conflicto se remita a una sola palabra incluida en la constitución de 1978 : nacionalidades . Esto e lo que dicen algunos de los redactores originales del texto al respecto .
 • Las redes sociales quieren competir con Bitcoin . Las empresas de redes y comunicaciones Facebook , Telegram y Signal están planeando lanzar sus propias criptomonedas para que sus usuarios , de por sí cautivos , utilicen la plataformas también para enviar dinero . El sistema le permitiría usar los servicios de mensajería para mover fondos sin importar la fronteras internacionales .
 • La mejor manera para superar tu adicción al celular . Los teléfonos móviles son sumamente prácticos , pero también sumamente adictivos : ¿cuándo fue la última vez que tuviste una conversación sin que alguno de los involucrados volteara a ver su celular ? ¿Qué tal la última ocasión en la que terminaste viendo redes sociales mientras esperabas para encontrarte con alguien ? Kevin Roose , columnista de tecnología de The New York Times , logró rehabilitarse . Así e como lo hizo ( una pista : alfarería ) .
 • Grandes pequeños influenciadores : la marcas que recurren a los niños . Los infantes utilizan cada vez más la redes sociales y plataformas como Instagram y YouTube ; empresas como Mattel y Crayola se han dado cuenta . Las compañías ahora están reclutando niños [ en inglés ] como Samia Ali , de 4 años , para promocionar sus productos entre los seguidores de la misma edad .
 • En esta serie , los perdedores son los que dan de qué hablar . En el mundo deportivo nadie quiere ser el derrotado ( bueno , a menos que se haya hecho alguna apuesta truculenta ) , pero siempre hay ganadores y perdedores . ¿Qué significa ser los segundos ? Para saberlo , te recomiendo la nueva miniserie documental de Netflix , Losers , con historias de quienes no llegaron a los libros de historia : desde un golfista que tenía el trofeo asegurado hasta que decidió hacer jugadas experimentales en el hoyo 18 hasta una patinadora que hizo un truco impresionante que fue calificado como ilegal , posiblemente por el color de su piel .
 • Más alto , más lejos , más rápido : ¿la Capitana Marvel alcanzará a cumplir con la expectativas ? Este viernes se estrena la primera película del estudio detrás de los Vengadores que tiene una protagonista , pese a que la imprenta de Marvel Comics tiene varios títulos con mujeres en el centro . Hablamos con la codirectora del filme , la autora de los cómics que lo inspiraron ( mi favorita , Kelly Sue DeConnick ) y con Brie Larson , la actriz principal , sobre el peso de la expectativas y la creencia de que los filmes de cómics protagonizados por una mujer no pueden ser taquilleros .
 El gobierno inglés cambió recientemente los lineamientos para que se debatan temas como la menstruación y la parejas del mismo sexo en la escuelas , lo que provocó protestas de varios padre de familia en el país . Sus quejas hicieron eco entre algunos de nuestros seguidores :
 “ Esa educación debe iniciar en casa , con la información desde la perspectiva y experiencia de los padre ” , afirmó una lectora en Facebook . Para otro lector , el programa representa “ un monton de idea vulgares amorales ” . Sin embargo , hay quienes celebraron los cambios : “ Desde mi punto de vista no prepararlos en todo esos temas e similar a aventarlos a un mundo sin herramientas para protegerse ” .

 Twenty year later , we still have n't partied like we did in 1999 .
 By Ross Douthat
 Opinion Columnist
 There ’ s a theory of human psychology that hold that the time you enter maturity becomes fixed in your mind a a civilizational peak — with everything since a falling-off that conveniently match your own stagger toward the grave . Thus it doesn ’ t matter if you came of age in the Great Depression or some other nadir ; because you were 18 then , it must have been a golden age .
 Some of u are lucky , though : Our solipsism actually match the wave function of history , and the moment we entered adulthood really wa a peak . That ’ s the case for my cohort , for Americans born around 1980 . Whether you choose to call u “ Xennials ” or “ Generation Catalano ” ( after the heartthrob on “ My So-Called Life , ” our first teen show ) , the important thing is that we became legal adult at the end of the 1990s , and bliss it wa in that time to be alive .
 Not that we knew it then , of course , because no punk 18-year-old know anything . But I ’ ve been thinking about how good we had it lately because we ’ re 20 year out from 1999 , and the cultural press is thick with reminder that it wa a pop-culture annus mirabilis — from the premiere of “ The Sopranos ” that defined a golden age of television , to the yearlong cascade of brilliant movie ( The Ringer recently wrote up a top 50 film list for ’ 99 ; in 2019 it wa a struggle to write up a top 10 ) from a Hollywood not yet captive to the superhero era .
 Widen the aperture a little , so that the “ Xennial ” cultural era cover 1995 to 2005 , and you get everything from the perfection of the sitcom ( late “ Seinfeld , ” season one of “ Friends , ” the silver age of “ The Simpsons , ” “ Arrested Development ” ) to the peak of HBO ( when “ The Wire ” and “ The Sopranos ” and “ Deadwood ” and “ Sex and the City ” were all airing ) . Oh , and those were also the day when George R.R . Martin could publish three “ Game of Thrones ” novel in five year , inventing all the good part of the TV show ’ s plot in an end-of-millennium rush .
 De gustibus non est disputandum , and if you prefer a zillion algorithmically-generated Netflix show and endless Marvel sequel to “ The Matrix ” and “ The Sopranos , ” then God bless you . But cold hard economic data also suggest that ours wa a uniquely blessed coming-of-age : a time of low unemployment , surging productivity , strong working-class wage growth — and all without a huge overhang of public and private debt .
 In March , a Time magazine writer , Charlotte Alter , attracted some conservative sneer on Twitter for explaining the youthful vogue for socialism by arguing that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ’ s generation had a coming-of-age “ defined by financial crisis , debt & climate change … No wonder she and her peer are moving left . ”
 The sneerer argued that the Ocasio-Cortezans exaggerate the burden borne by twentysomethings , which is fair — this is still a rich country whose young people are relatively privileged .
 But a a statement about generational experience , Alter wa basically right . If you were born around 1980 , you grew up in a space happily between — between era of existential threat ( Cold War/War on Terror , or Cold War/climate change ) , between foreign policy debacle ( Vietnam/Iraq ) , between epidemic ( crack and AIDS/opioids and suicide ) , and between two different period of economic stagnation ( the ’ 70 and early Aughts ) . If you were born later , you experienced slow growth followed by financial crisis followed by a recovery that ’ s only lately returned u to the median-income and unemployment stats of … 1999 .
 And even with under-4 percent unemployment , the difference between our economy and 1999 ’ s are notable : Our current expansion feature lower work force participation rate and weaker productivity growth , a fertility collapse instead of the modest 1990s baby boom … plus it ’ s all floated by deficit that seem necessary but aren ’ t a sign of deep economic health .
 But perhaps the best way to understand the lost world of 20 year ago is that it wa the just-enough-internet era . There wa just enough internet to boost economic productivity ( the Facebook-Amazon era ha not had a similar effect ) , just enough to encourage subcultural ferment , just enough to challenge cultural gatekeeper and give lonely teenager succor . It wa the early blogosphere instead of Twitter mob , serendipity instead of ruthless curation , geek culture a an insurgency rather than a corporate establishment , online a an escape for eccentric rather than an addictive dystopia for everyone .
 Still , we should have seen the bad day coming . The filmmaker of 1999 did , a Reason magazine ’ s Jesse Walker noted when The Ringer ’ s top-100 list came out . “ Election , ” “ The Matrix , ” “ Fight Club , ” “ The Blair Witch Project , ” “ Office Space , ” “ The Talented Mr. Ripley , ” even ( God help u ) “ The Phantom Menace ” … it ’ s all there , everything that followed , class anxiety and workplace alienation , end-of-history discontent and internet-fueled hoax , disputed election and virtual-reality prison , plus a tottering republic waiting for it Palpatine .
 We should have listened . Instead , we took that stupid red pill from “ The Matrix , ” and now we ’ ll never find our way back up .

 LONDON — As soon a they poured off the Tube at the Seven Sisters stop , the Victoria Line depositing hundred of fan every minute , they were on autopilot . Heads down through the station , turn left at the top of the escalator , out into the early evening light , and north .
 Tottenham Hotspur ’ s supporter have not walked this way for 689 long day , but they know the route by heart : past Tottenham Green , down the hill , onto the High Road . There , the street once again closed to traffic on matchday , they lingered a little , taking photo of the space-age structure looming above them , marveling at the speed and the scale of change . Now , everything would be different . And yet somehow so familiar wa the setting that it all felt the same . Tottenham Hotspur wa back home .
 That is how the club see the $ 1 billion stadium it inaugurated with a 2-0 win against Crystal Palace on Wednesday night : not so much a move a a return ; new and gleaming and modern , but somehow in keeping with tradition , too , a fusion of the future and the past .
 “ We are home , ” the club ’ s announcer said before the start of a brief opening ceremony . There wa genuine emotion in his voice . Thousands of flag , emblazoned with the slogan “ Welcome Home , ” fluttered in the stand .
 It is not quite that simple , of course . Those thousand of fan making the journey down the Seven Sisters Road have been waiting for this moment throughout their club ’ s long exile at Wembley : the day when they would step once again on familiar territory , when they might retrace the step of more than a century , when they would be back where they belong .
 They started arriving early , filling first the street and then the stand hour before kickoff , not just savoring the occasion , but getting their bearing , too . They needed to work out how long the line for security would take . They wanted to sample the bar , to find their seat , to take in the view , to try out the acoustic . The grid reference and the postal code might be the same , but the mechanic of a matchday , necessarily , could not be . A house doe not become a home overnight .
 That this stadium — named , for now , after the club — is beautiful is not in question . As part of the design process , Tottenham ’ s chairman , Daniel Levy , and Chris Lee of Populous , the stadium ’ s architect , visited hundred of stadium around the world : not just those that house soccer team , but arena that host other sport , too .
 They tried to incorporate element from those that impressed them into Tottenham ’ s new facility : the stadium ’ s centerpiece , the vast bank of it South Stand , owes a nod of inspiration not just to the Kop stand traditional in England but — a ha been much trumpeted in the last few year — to the Yellow Wall at Borussia Dortmund , widely regarded a the most intimidating grandstand in Europe .
 To an inexpert eye , though , there were plenty of other reference : the curved line of the stand are redolent of Olympique Marseille ’ s Stade Velodrome , redesigned for the 2016 European Championship , and Benfica ’ s Estadio da Luz ; the sense of proximity to the field , of fan towering over the player , is something that would be familiar to anyone who ha been to La Bombonera , where Boca Juniors play ; there is an echo in the layout , too , of the Allianz Arena , home of Bayern Munich .
 Those stadium are all very different , but they are united by the reputation they have for boisterous , deafening atmosphere , the holy grail of any modern arena . Something in their design — either deliberate or by chance — capture and trap noise . It wash down on to the field and swirl around the air . It enhances the experience not just for the fan in attendance , but for those watching on , living vicariously , at home .
 Levy and Lee wanted Tottenham to lay claim to the finest stadium in the world , a place where fan wanted to spend time — and , a a consequence , money — before and after the whistle . They took care to give the place a sheen of luxury , making sure everything from the toilet to the food were a level above anything a visitor might find elsewhere .
 But they knew , too , that what make a stadium great is not just the quality of it finish but the feeling it engenders ; they wanted to infuse it with a little of the magic that of Dortmund and Munich and Marseille , designing not just something to take the breath away , but a place to make fan scream their lung hoarse .
 Though design is a part of that — a anyone who ha been to the many soulless bowl on the outskirt of English market town would testify — it is not something that can be created out of nothing . Atmosphere can not be boiled down to an equation : this many fan multiplied by this much gradient divided by this distance to the field .
 It is something organic , something that develops over month and year , a composite of the character of the crowd and the experience they have lived through , the memory they share , and the nature of and expectation on the team . It doe not appear out of the ether .
 Spurs have done all they can to help that process along . At the end of the opening ceremony , with the team on the field — and Crystal Palace ’ s player looking entirely baffled by the whole farrago — the camera focused in on Harry Kane , Tottenham ’ s captain and totem . He wa gazing out at the stand , wearing the stoic but proud look of a father watching a child graduate . Well , he might : he ha waited long enough to see this day , and he had good reason to be pleased with the result . The place is everything Spurs hoped , and promised , it would be .
 It is not , though , everything it will be , not yet . It wa never going to be , not on it opening night . Spurs are back where they have always been , at the end of that long and familiar walk , left out of Seven Sisters and north , up the High Road . The setting is the same . The backdrop is comforting . But the building is different ; still , for now , a house , not yet a home .

 Of all the obstacle to initiating hospice care that have been cited , the devotion of wife to husband , or child to parent , is the hardest to quantify .
 By Mikkael A. Sekeres , M.D .
 I had been seeing my patient for 12 year . He and his wife frequently marveled over how much time had passed since we first met , a if celebrating his perseverance in standing down a terrible disease and the enduring friendship that ensued .
 He had myelofibrosis , a cancer of the bone marrow that wa particularly unforgiving . As the diseased bone marrow cell grow , they release substance that cause scar tissue to form within the marrow space — a process we doctor call fibrosis . The remaining normal bone marrow cell , sensing the unrelenting blight threatening their home , relocate to the spleen and , le commonly , to the liver .
 These organ swell to accommodate their new citizen , which can hurt . But in doing so , they also encroach on the stomach and intestine , reducing the volume of food they can hold . As a result , people with myelofibrosis sometimes die from the consequence of low blood count — bleeding and infection — but also of malnutrition , a the simple act of taking in adequate calorie for sustenance becomes impossible .
 Over the past few week , he had repeated hospitalization for fever and continued to lose weight . In the exam room , he sat in a wheelchair with his eye closed , sleeping off-and-on , his arm covered with bruise and belly swollen with his enlarged spleen . His wife and daughter sat next to him . I think we all knew the end wa near .
 His wife accompanied him on every visit . After more than 50 year of marriage , they were inseparable , and a testimony to the phrase “ opposite attract. ” She wa sunshine to his rain , Tigger to his Eeyore . If she commented on what a lovely summer ’ s day we were having , his retort would be , “ I ’ ll probably get a sunburn. ” When she celebrated his blood count improving from a new treatment we ’ d instituted , he ’ d reply , “ Well , they ’ re still not normal yet. ” She always laughed in response , glance over to me , and say , “ Oh , you know how he is ! ”
 And I did . She loved him for his parsimony of word , and for his gruffness , which wa partly an act to see how she ’ d respond , and so did I .
 Not for the first time , I raised the idea of hospice care . The two lived independently , with their daughter a few mile away .
 “ I can ’ t imagine how you ’ re caring for him alone , ” I said to her . “ Even getting him to the bathroom must be a struggle . ”
 “ It ’ s not so bad , ” she said quickly . “ We manage . ”
 “ If we initiated hospice , it might be easier for you , to have an extra person at home to help out , and make sure he ’ s not in pain . We could even get him medicine without your having to bring him to appointment here , ” I added , knowing that it took her an hour to get him dressed and into the car . He opened his eye briefly a we talked but didn ’ t say anything and closed them again .
 She shook her head . “ I don ’ t need anybody . ”
 “ Mom , you do ! ” her daughter interjected , eye welling with tear . “ You can ’ t handle him anymore . He ’ s too big to lean on you . He ’ s too sick . He could fall , and you wouldn ’ t be able to get him off the ground . I have to work during the day , so I can ’ t be there . Why won ’ t you let the doctor get you some help ? ”
 She shook her head again , resolute . “ I met this man when I wa 14 year old . We got married three year later . And I made a promise that I would care for him through sickness and health ’ til … ” She paused for a moment , choosing her word . “ Well , until the end . I am not letting a stranger into my house to help . I made a promise . ”
 “ You have been caring for him , ” I said , a gently a I could . “ That won ’ t stop with hospice . “
 She crossed her arm and thought about what her daughter and I had said . Then she turned to her husband .
 “ What do you think ? About hospice ? ” she asked him .
 He opened his eye at the sound of her voice . I wasn ’ t sure how much of this conversation he had been listening to . “ Whatever you say , ” he answered , and closed his eye again . I didn ’ t know how to interpret that , but his wife did .
 “ We ’ ll consider it , ” she said to me , in a way that really meant , “ We ’ ll pas on hospice . ”
 They left the exam room and walked down the hallway slowly , my patient ’ s wife pushing his wheelchair , his daughter carrying her coat and purse .
 It wa the last I saw of him . The following week , he had a cardiac arrest at home and died , with only his wife in attendance .
 Of all the obstacle to initiating hospice that have been cited , from physician delay to inadequate resource , this one — the devotion of wife to husband , or child to parent , and their reluctance to welcome another into that bond — is the hardest to quantify . She later told me it wa about a good a death a they could have hoped for , all thing considered .
 I think even her husband would have agreed with her on that .

 The installation , scheduled this month , are set for the famed avenue that ha been the site of weekly “ Yellow Vest ” economic-inequality protest .
 By Daphné Anglès
 PARIS — When the colorful , fantastical fountain by Jean Tinguely and Niki de Saint Phalle were unveiled in 1983 beside the Georges Pompidou Center , many Parisians complained , saying the structure were gaudy , provocative and clashed with the adjacent gothic St. Merri Church .
 Now , more than 35 year later , six new crystal-laden fountain are being readied for even more prominent placement , on the Champs-Élysées , the famed avenue that ha seen month of sometimes violent “ Yellow Vest ” protest over economic division and simmering class inequity .
 Designed by Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec , brother renowned for creating strikingly imaginative high-end object , the fountain are scheduled to spring to life late this month around the Rond-Point de Champs-Élysées , the busy traffic circle halfway between the Place de la Concorde and the Arc de Triomphe . The water is to gush downward from delicate Swarovski crystal branch atop tall , slender tower that rotate — so slowly a to be almost imperceptible . And at night , with the crystal lit from the inside , the branch and the water stream are expected to sparkle like diamond .
 “ We wanted them to seem like strange apparition , something subtle and delicate rather than eye-popping , ” Ronan Bouroullec said over coffee in their studio in Paris ’ s Belleville neighborhood . “ The challenge wa to find the right balance between the historical surroundings and something very contemporary . ”
 The timing of the new installation , however , ha raised concern . On Saturdays since November , the Yellow Vests , a nationwide movement against government policy that the protester say benefit the elite and penalize the working class , have been occupying — and at time vandalizing — the Champs-Élysées .
 “ For the Yellow Vests , the Champs-Élysées is perceived a the space of the elite and of power , ” said Danielle Tartakowsky , a professor of social movement at Paris 8 University .
 A ring of fountain wa first laid out at the same spot about 160 year ago a part of Baron Georges-Eugène Haussmann ’ s redesign of the city . In the 1930s , their spigot were swapped out with bird- and squirrel-shaped glass spout by the Art Deco artist René Lalique , which were in turn replaced in the 1950s by Max Ingrand , an artist and light-fixture designer . But in 1998 , crowd of soccer fan celebrating France ’ s World Cup victory trampled the ground , damaging the aging spigot and some of the piping , bringing the fountain to a standstill . They remained so for the next two decade ; now , 6.3 million euro ( $ 7.15 million ) ha been donated by business sponsor to replace them .
 The Bouroullec brother ( Ronan is 47 year old and Erwan , 42 ) , have made their name through elegant industrial product , and their limited-edition object are prized by art collector . They have been commissioned to design furniture for François Pinault ’ s private museum being created near Les Halles , and have designed work for public space , including a cloudlike canopy in the Miami Design District , park bench in Copenhagen and a chandelier in the Palace of Versailles .
 The fountain are the brother ’ first urban commission for Paris . “ The choice of the Bouroullecs is in continuity with a tradition in France ” of having designer of luxury product create item for public space , said Meredith TenHoor , an architecture historian and associate professor at Pratt Institute in New York .
 The fountain , part of an ambitious redevelopment of the Champs-Élysées , are financed primarily by business with commercial interest along the avenue . For example , Galeries Lafayette , one of the donor , is scheduled to open a store there on March 28 . “ We feel we are making a strong contribution to the cultural and commercial ecosystem that we will soon be part of , ” said Guillaume Houzé , the retail group ’ s head of communication .
 J.M . Weston , a luxury shoemaker with a boutique across the street from Galeries Lafayette ’ s new store , contributed through it holding company EPI . Other donor included a Qatari sovereign fund that owns real estate along the avenue ; Swarovski , which produced the crystal for the fountain ; and Dassault Aviation , the aircraft maker whose headquarters overlook the traffic circle where they are to stand .
 The fund-raising campaign wa spearheaded by Fonds Pour Paris , a private organization that also raised money for the production of Jeff Koons ’ “ Bouquet of Tulips ” sculpture , soon to stand in the garden of the Petit Palais , and ha commissioned Olafur Eliasson , the noted Icelandic-Danish artist , to redesign the Arc de Triomphe ’ s lighting .
 For Pierre-Antoine Gatier , a chief architect for historical monument who oversees the restoration of several Paris landmark , introducing contemporary design to Haussmann ’ s urban layout is crucial to the city ’ s identity . “ Paris is history , ” he said , “ but a city need to be alive and in touch with the evolution of mind . ”
 And for all their seeming delicacy , the fountain are engineered to withstand high wind — and other object . If hit by item thrown by protester , for example , Ronan Bouroullec said , “ the crystal would crack but not shatter . ”
 He said he hoped , however , that the fountain would be safe . “ Fountains are joyful , ” he said . “ They are about childhood and pleasure ; they are marvel . ”
 An earlier version of a picture caption with this article transposed the position of the Bouroullec brother . Erwan is on the left and Ronan is on the right . Another picture caption misidentified who wa working with a part of the fountain 's structure . It wa Ronan Bouroullec , not Erwan . Also , an additional picture caption omitted information about an image of the Rond-Point de Champs Élysées ; the fountain in the photograph were digitally rendered .

 Mets 2 , Nationals 0
 By Kevin Armstrong
 WASHINGTON — A beard on his face , a new catcher in front of him and Robinson Cano at his back : Plenty had changed in Jacob deGrom ’ s world between the time he won the National League Cy Young Award last fall and when he took the mound for the Mets ’ season opener on Thursday .
 He needed time to reorient himself at first .
 His schedule had also been upended in recent day . Coming out of spring training , he had to leave the team to attend a marathon negotiating session in Sarasota , Fla. , and had to rearrange his travel schedule so he could undergo a physical examination in New York before he wa reunited with his teammate in Washington .
 Though the diversion all resulted in a five-year contract extension worth $ 137.5 million , deGrom said the process had been taxing . He also had unfamiliar jitter .
 “ I wa really nervous , ” he said . “ There wa some pressure on me today . ”
 DeGrom , who had only a 10-9 record despite a 1.70 earned run average last season , welcomed support from all corner , including from the newcomer , a he worked through an adrenaline rush and early struggle with off-speed pitch for a 2-0 win over the Nationals .
 Catcher Wilson Ramos , making his Mets debut , kept deGrom on track . Cano , 36 , demonstrated why General Manager Brodie Van Wagenen traded for him in December with a home run in the first inning , stylish fielding in the third and an inside-out swing for a single that drove in the insurance run in the eighth .
 Cano ’ s work assured defeat for the Nationals ’ Max Scherzer , who ha won three Cy Young Awards and finished a the runner-up to deGrom in last season ’ s voting .
 “ That ’ s what it take to win , not just the standard routine play , ” Mets Manager Mickey Callaway said . “ You have to do the small thing right , but you have to have baseball awareness and make other team pay when they make a mistake , and Cano did that . ”
 DeGrom , who despite all his accomplishment had not been given the ball on opening day before , kept the Nationals off balance . His fastball reached a high a 98 mile per hour , and a changeup on a 3-2 count to Juan Soto , the Nationals ’ cleanup hitter , with a runner on third base in the bottom of the sixth yielded the last of deGrom ’ s 10 strikeout .
 “ One of the filthiest pitch I ’ ve ever seen , ” Callaway said . “ I kind of figured he wa going to throw it . He had him sped up . It wa the perfect time to do it . You just can ’ t lay off of it . It drop a foot and look just like a strike until the last second . An unbelievably well-executed pitch to a great hitter . ”
 In a game billed a a classic duel of ace , both pitcher looked ready for another year of competing for the title of best in the league .
 DeGrom , 30 , lasted six inning , throwing 93 pitch and yielding five hit . Scherzer , 34 , went seven and two-thirds inning , threw 109 pitch , struck out 12 Mets and gave up two earned run .
 The Mets ’ bullpen , which often faltered last year a the team went 77-85 , kept the shutout intact with strong work that included appearance from two off-season acquisition .
 Seth Lugo followed deGrom by striking out the side in the seventh . Jeurys Familia , back with the Mets after finishing last season in Oakland , handled the eighth without giving up a hit . Then closer Edwin Diaz , who became a Met in the deal with the Mariners that also yielded Cano , collected the save .
 “ That wa a hell of a trade by Brodie , ” Callaway said of the general manager .
 Van Wagenen , who wa in attendance , watched his off-season investment pay immediate dividend . Shortly after switching from life a an agent to management last fall , Van Wagenen had traded for Cano , one of his former client .
 “ It ’ s a perfect day , ” Cano said after the win . “ Being behind deGrom is always fun . ”
 Callaway and deGrom marveled at Cano ’ s awareness on defense , particularly in the bottom of the third , when Nationals center fielder Victor Robles stroked a double to left and then celebrated at second base with the motion of shooting an arrow into the sky . He advanced to third when right fielder Adam Eaton knocked a single .
 DeGrom proceeded to strike out shortstop Trea Turner . The Nationals ’ Anthony Rendon then chopped a ball to third baseman Jeff McNeil , who fielded it and threw to Cano at second to record one out . Cano , alert to Robles ’ s starting and stopping , threw to Ramos at home , who then had Robles in a rundown . Ramos threw back to McNeil , who sprinted after Robles before tagging him for the out . DeGrom expressed appreciation not only for the out but for the timing .
 “ I wa covering home there , ” deGrom said . “ I don ’ t know if this ball is going to get thrown to me , but I think you ’ re allowed to get run over at the plate . McNeil did a nice job of tagging him before he got to me . ”
 With the jitter gone and the opener won , deGrom said , “ Now just get back into my routine . ”

 Star Trek : Discovery
 By Sopan Deb
 The season finale of “ Star Trek : Discovery ” wa true to form : alternately impressive and head-scratching ; a visual marvel and yet muddled ; nostalgic and fresh . And by the end of the episode , Spock suggests that Starfleet should essentially erase the existence of the Discovery . Unintentionally , Spock wa voicing the thought of a vocal segment of “ Star Trek ” fan .
 Much of the episode , at least for me , recalled “ Star Trek : Nemesis , ” one of the more reviled Trek movie . There is an intensely long battle in which the Enterprise ( and the Discovery , in this case ) are massively outgunned by an enemy with the upper hand . The future of humanity is at stake . There is even an extended — and a bit pointless — boarding party when Leland beam over to the Discovery .
 But this battle played to a strength of “ Discovery ” : Olatunde Osunsanmi , who directed the episode , know how to create riveting tension . The fast cut , combined with the shaky cam , provided constant visual stimulation , almost taking the viewer on a roller-coaster ride . And unlike many “ Trek ” battle , this one , featuring a fleet of possessed Section 31 ship led by Leland against the Enterprise and the Discovery , felt realistic . In many starship fight in “ Trek ” lore , an enemy ship will fire one or two shot , and suddenly , one of the most powerful ship in the Federation will have it shield down — like in “ Star Trek : Generations. ” Here , both the Enterprise and the Discovery both take and deliver a wallop .
 I wa riveted by the episode — the stake felt real and drawn out — until the Klingons and the Ba ’ ul fighter showed up . This is where it went off the rail for me . I ’ ve been harping on this quite a bit this season : Ash Tyler is not supposed to be alive in the eye of the Klingons . His existence nearly cost L ’ Rell her chancellorship before it got off the ground . And there he wa on the bridge of a Klingon ship next to L ’ Rell . The notion that L ’ Rell could pull this off without significant opposition from other Klingons — or even from her own crew member — is questionable at best . And somehow , the Ba ’ ul and Klingons are able to come lend a hand , but no other Starfleet ship ?
 Certain inconsistency you can live with . Here , I wa distracted .
 Particularly when Burnham and Spock solve another grand mystery , which is when Burnham sent the red signal . It turn out it wa never from the future . She sent them from the present to bring them to this point , so that afterward , they can go into the future .
 This wa another instance that confused me . From my understanding ( and please email me if I ’ m incorrect ! ) , Control ( i.e . Leland ) wa coming for the sphere data and wouldn ’ t stop until they had it . This is why the Discovery ha to go into the future . It ’ s very existence is the problem , a Spock said in the first part of the episode . Yet , in the finale , Georgiou , following a long fist fight , tell the bridge that Leland ha been killed .
 “ Control ha been neutralized , ” she tell Saru .
 So why doe Discovery have to go into the future ? Why not put a pin in that plan ? The sphere data is valuable . To push an entire Starfleet crew into the future seems like a drastic step if the deadly enemy ha been offset — even if temporarily . It would also deprive the Federation of key asset : a time suit , the spore drive and some of it best officer . Spock also mention that the time crystal show a version of the future that can apparently be avoided . So why wa it such a big deal for Pike to take a crystal out of Boreth ? Wasn ’ t Pike told he wa locked into his future ?
 I liked that the episode wa more of an ensemble effort : Every crew member had a moment of some sort , even Cornwell , although her death seemed unnecessary . And knowing “ Discovery , ” she ’ ll find a way to have survived the blast .
 But the ending is where I found myself very baffled : Why did the Enterprise crew , and those associated with it , decide to lie to Starfleet about what happened with the Discovery ? There didn ’ t seem to be a logical reason to . Spock , in particular , given his character history , would seem to have a hard time not telling the truth about this . The Discovery just saved the universe ! Why hide their contribution ? Maybe Starfleet would authorize the construction of a new time suit to bring back the Discovery crew . ( And Spock , who suggests that everyone who know about the existence of Discovery should keep quiet , close the episode with a personal log which would reveal , or at least , acknowledge the falsehood . What if someone got a hold of it ? )
 It wa an uneven finale for an uneven show . Season 2 wa certainly an improvement on the first season but overall , “ Discovery ” still felt like it wa trying to find it footing . Ethan Peck wa always going to have difficult shoe to fill with Spock . Over the course of the season , Spock went from petulant to showing a warmth for Burnham , exhibiting a range that felt to me out of character for the Spock we ’ ve come to know . ( I did think it wa a nice moment when Burnham and Spock said good bye to each other . )
 But that ’ s where we leave off : The Discovery is presumably in the future . Spock is on the Enterprise . And what about the Control-As-Borg theory ?
 Speaking of which …
 • Lots of “ Discovery ” fan were convinced that Control is the origin story for the Borg . We don ’ t get definitive resolution on that in the finale . But maybe next season ?
 • We know there is going to be a Season 3 . We also know Anson Mount is leaving “ Discovery ” after this season . So where doe the third run of the show take place ? In the future ? Does it center on Spock ?
 • A shout out to Anson Mount and Rebecca Romijn ( Number One ) , who is also saying bon voyage to “ Discovery. ” They were both charismatic asset for the show . I ’ d love to see Tig Notaro come back next season a well .
 • Thanks for following along this season . It ’ s much appreciated .

 An Appraisal
 By Stacy Y . China
 Quick — name a transformative black television character .
 James Evans . Cliff Huxtable . Olivia Pope . Cookie Lyon . Annalise Keating .
 Neil Winters .
 You only paused if you did not grow up , a I did , watching “ The Young and the Restless . ”
 Kristoff St. John , who died this week at 52 , originated the role of Neil Winters on “ Y & R ” — a it is commonly referred to by it fan — in 1991 and played it up until his death . With 28 year in the show ’ s fictional Genoa City , St. John wa the second-longest-serving black soap opera actor , behind James Reynolds of “ Days of Our Lives . ”
 [ Read our obituary of Kristoff St. John , who played Neil Winters . ]
 Black men like Neil have been hard to come by on television . He wa a young , up-and-coming executive at Newman Enterprises , fresh out of Stanford . He wa self-assured without being arrogant , and down-to-earth without being a caricature or a clown . He wa ambitious , he loved his friend , and he got along well with all of those veteran , high-flying executive type .
 His obvious romantic interest wa Olivia — doctor , sorority sister , beautiful . His longtime love , though , turned out to be Drucilla ( Victoria Rowell ) , Olivia ’ s outspoken sister , who wa also lovely but decidedly rougher around the edge . Drucilla wa Cookie Lyon , minus the prison stint , before there wa a Cookie Lyon .
 I wa groomed to care — our mother raised my brother and me while CBS soap opera played in the background . I knew about the Spauldings and the Bauers on “ Guiding Light ” long before I knew most of my classmate ’ name at school .
 I wa more fond of “ As the World Turns ” and “ Guiding Light ” — CBS program sponsored by Procter & Gamble — but my mother and my brother were all for “ Y & R. ” It wa more glamorous ; it had fancier set and better lighting .
 When we got a VCR , “ Y & R ” had to be taped everyday , so they could watch it in the evening .
 This practice occasionally annoyed me , until Neil , Olivia and Drucilla arrived . Then I got interested . Black folk ! And black folk tackling issue of assimilation and acceptance . Could Neil take Dru around his work colleague , who were not ready for her bluntness ? Would it just be easier to woo Olivia and be done with it ?
 Neil and Dru became not quite a supercouple ( see Angie and Jesse of “ All My Children ” if you want that ) , but a memorable couple . They dealt with the outlandish stuff that all soap couple endure — infidelity , secret-keeping , family tension . But they were real with each other .
 They teased each other , they fought , they made up , they confided in each other , saying thing about the people on their job that they would never say in public . They talked about each other ’ s family member . And they could cut their eye at each other in a way that eliminated the need for page and page of script .
 They were hilarious , without trying to be hilarious .
 They were black . And working hard . And mostly stayed out of trouble . And they mostly loved each other .
 In the 1990s and 2000s , this wa rare .
 “ Y & R ” eventually created a whole complicated family life around Neil , while continuing to further his career . He went on to work at Jabot and at Chancellor Enterprises , the show ’ s other major corporation , and became chief executive at Newman for a time .
 After Drucilla disappeared in 2007 ( I know ! ) , Neil mourned profusely . Then he got on with life .
 He dated , he married , he divorced , he supported his daughter and his son . Whatever storm the Winters ’ extended family found itself in , there wa Neil , helping to hold it together .
 St. John wa still a young man on a veteran show . He could have had many more year a Neil , wrangling with a younger generation led by his child , Lily and Devon .
 Through it all , Neil wa not a thug , not a troubled child , not somebody the white people needed to save . He did not need “ help. ” He wa an equal . He wasn ’ t anyone ’ s charity project .
 All he needed wa a chance , and Genoa City gave him that .
 I stopped watching regularly long ago , but at least once a year , I ’ ll be home on a holiday with my brother and my mother , and one of u will turn on “ Y & R. ” We will marvel at how this one , or that one , is still on the show . We feel like we know them . We do , in a way . We ’ ve known them for over 30 year .
 I ’ m sorry that Neil will no longer be a part of that homecoming .

 The Carpetbagger
 By Kyle Buchanan
 “ Roma ” and “ The Favourite ” led the Oscar nomination Tuesday morning , but which expected nominee missed the mark ? Below , your Carpetbagger run through some of the highest-profile snub and surprise .
 [ Read more about the nomination | See the full list and vote for your favorite . ]
 Once upon a time , Bradley Cooper ’ s showbiz musical seemed like it had the stuff to go all the way during award season . Yet the film hasn ’ t picked up any high-profile win so far , and this morning , “ A Star Is Born ” wa snubbed for nomination in best editing and best director , two honor that should have been easy pickup . Cooper , who eschewed plenty of all-important acting round table this season to better focus on his debut a a director , may now go empty-handed on Oscar night : His best-actor competitor Rami Malek , the lead of “ Bohemian Rhapsody , ” ha all the momentum after winning at the Golden Globes .
 Marvel landed it first best picture nominee with “ Black Panther , ” which also performed well in the technical category , picking up a historic nomination for the production designer Hannah Beachler , who became the first African-American nominated in her field . Still , it sting a bit that the academy had two chance to honor the director Ryan Coogler , who also co-wrote the screenplay , and declined both .
 After becoming one of the youngest men to be nominated for best actor last year , Timothée Chalamet , the “ Call Me by Your Name ” star , found a rougher reception with “ Beautiful Boy , ” in which he played a troubled drug addict . The film wa met with mixed review and so-so box office , but Amazon still spent heavily on his supporting-actor campaign , to no avail . It wa a mixed morning for the streaming service : Though the “ Cold War ” director Pawel Pawlikowski made it into the best director race , “ Suspiria ” wa snubbed for best hair and makeup , and the rival Netflix easily picked up nomination after nomination . Speaking of which …
 Though Netflix show are regularly showered with Emmy nomination , best picture recognition at the Oscars ha eluded the company until now . On Tuesday , “ Roma ” earned Netflix it first nomination for Oscar ’ s top prize , a well a a great many other nomination , including lead actress for Yalitza Aparicio and supporting actress for Marina de Tavira , both of whom had been snubbed by the Screen Actors Guild . One notable academy snub ? Editing . Yes , Alfonso Cuarón ’ s film is mostly composed of languid long take , but an editing nomination is often considered a key milestone on the way to a best picture win . Then again , “ A Star Is Born ” didn ’ t crack the category , either .
 After a robust year for documentary at the box office , many pundit assumed that “ Won ’ t You Be My Neighbor ? , ” Morgan Neville ’ s documentary about the child ’ s show host Mister Rogers , would be the feel-good favorite . Well , don ’ t take your shoe off just yet : Neville ’ s film wa one of this morning ’ s most shocking snub . With “ Won ’ t You Be My Neighbor ? ” out , could the Ruth Bader Ginsburg documentary “ RBG ” become the new front-runner ? In addition to it best documentary nomination , it also picked up a nomination for best song .
 This race-relations dramedy pulled out an upset win at the Producers Guild of America last weekend , so I wondered if it might show up in some unexpected category on Tuesday , signaling real Oscar strength . While “ Green Book ” did score nomination for best picture and best original screenplay , a well a for the actor Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali , it didn ’ t crack the lineup for director or supporting actress . The Producers Guild honor usually foretells the winner of the best picture Oscar , but will that still hold true this year ? In a month , we ’ ll find out .
 An earlier version of this article misstated the Oscar category “ Green Book ” missed out on . It wa snubbed for director and supporting actress , but it did receive a nomination for editing .

 A small town in the San Francisco Bay Area is apparently unamused by improvement that one of it high-profile resident ha made to a distinctive property known a the Flintstone House .
 The town of Hillsborough , Calif. , perhaps seeking to avoid becoming the next Bedrock , ha sued it owner to force the removal of dinosaur statue , a sign reading “ Yabba Dabba Doo ” ( the catchphrase of the animated television show ’ s prehistoric patriarch , Fred Flintstone ) and other landscaping , according to a lawsuit filed last week in State Superior Court .
 Nestled in a hilly community of about 11,000 in San Mateo County , where home routinely sell for million , this particular residence , with it curving line , red and purple dome , multicolored mushroom and scattered animal statue , ha long attracted attention from neighbor ( no , not the Rubbles ) .
 One could even say it is “ a page right out of history . ”
 But at least in it current form , official and some resident do not to want the home , which evokes the 1960s cartoon , in their backyard . A panel of code enforcement official last fall declared many recent renovation to the home to be a public nuisance , according to a town order , and have asked a judge to do the same . The suit alleges that the homeowner did not secure the proper permit and approval for the change .
 “ It is one thing to spot this house when driving by on the freeway ; you might find it amusing , ” Mark D. Hudak , a lawyer for the town , said on Monday in an email . “ It is a different thing to be a neighbor and see it all day , every day . ”
 The home ’ s owner , the retired medium mogul Florence Fang — whose family once published The San Francisco Examiner and other newspaper — “ will fight ” to save it , her grandson Sean Fang said , according to a statement obtained by The Associated Press last week .
 “ I think the dinosaur are beautiful , ” Mr. Fang said in the statement . “ They make everyone smile and should stay. ” Attempts to reach Ms. and Mr. Fang a well a other member of the family on Monday were not immediately successful . A person who picked up the phone at the Florence Fang Family Foundation , a nonprofit organization , said only that Ms. Fang , who is in her mid-80s , wa consulting with her lawyer .
 “ The Flintstones , ” which ran for six season , tracked the misadventure of two modern-day Stone Age family , the Flintstones and the Rubbles . A movie version starring John Goodman and Rosie O ’ Donnell hit theater in 1994 .
 In 1976 , the Bay Area architect William Nicholson built the 2,700-square-foot home using a building technique known a monolithic dome construction , according to Atlas Obscura , a publication that highlight curious place . Over the year , the home fell into disrepair but wa later renovated and then painted orange , Atlas Obscura said . Eventually , photo show , the dome became red and purple . In 2017 , Ms. Fang bought the home for $ 2.8 million after about two year on the market , according to various report .
 Rather than cherry tree or a vineyard , Ms. Fang installed 15-foot dinosaur statue a well a a giant metal woolly mammoth and giraffe ; a garden of colorful , oversize mushroom ; and a rainbow and peacock sculpture , according to The Mercury News , of San Jose , last year .
 For decade , driver crossing an area bridge had marveled at the home , on Berryessa Way , and Ms. Fang told the newspaper last March that she had been one of them .
 “ Before , passing by , I always wondered who ’ s living in that house , ” she told the newspaper . “ Now I ’ m the one . ”
 In the front yard she installed a life-size statue of Fred Flintstone , a smaller statue of his pet dinosaur , Dino , and much more , the newspaper reported .
 She also made other modification to the property , like adding a retaining wall , step , gate and a parking strip , which the complaint , filed on March 13 , say create “ life-safety hazard . ”
 The complaint alleges that Ms. Fang kept working on her home despite being issued three notice telling her to stop and failing to procure various approval and building permit . As a result , she wa cited for multiple violation of the town ’ s municipal code , according to the lawsuit . After the hearing last October at which the home wa declared a “ public nuisance , ” Ms. Fang wa fined $ 200 for creating what official called “ a highly visible eyesore ” that wa “ out of keeping with community standard , ” according to the lawsuit . The suit alleges that Ms. Fang paid the citation fee , but ha not met any of the other requirement of the town ’ s order . As a result , the town ha sued to force her to comply .
 The “ large figurine ” Ms. Fang installed are so tall , they “ are classified a unenclosed structure , ” which require a permit , according to the order , handed down by the town ’ s administrative hearing panel in October . The order note the “ dense population ” of dinosaur , mushroom and animal positioned in the back and front yard , and make reference to one of Ms. Fang ’ s neighbor , who , according to the document , “ stated that the landscaping appeared to be outside the norm . ”
 “ The panel can not support a project that proceeds on a ‘ build first , ask for permission later ’ basis , ” the order said . Ms. Fang ’ s improvement , the panel added , were “ designed to be very intrusive , resulting in the owner ’ s ‘ vision ’ for her property being imposed on many other property and view , without regard to the desire of other resident . ”
 And that , Mr. Hudak , the lawyer for Hillsborough , said , “ is the heart of the problem . ”
 Ms. Fang , he said , “ ha imposed her vision for this property on the entire community , without going through the permitting process that would have allowed public input . ”

 LOS ANGELES — Skeletons in the social medium closet of movie star , director and screenwriter have started to haunt Hollywood on an almost weekly basis .
 Kevin Hart imploding a Oscar host after his past anti-gay ramblings on Twitter were rediscovered . Disney being caught flat-footed when old pedophilia and rape joke by James Gunn , the “ Guardians of the Galaxy ” filmmaker , resurfaced online . The studio behind “ Green Book ” racing to contain the fallout when a four-year-old anti-Muslim tweet by one of the film ’ s screenwriter began recirculating .
 Is a new “ reputation management ” firm a solution ?
 On Monday , one of Hollywood ’ s leading medium relation agency , Principal Communications , said it had started a sister company that would specialize in scrutinizing the background of entertainment figure before hiring decision were made . The new company , Foresight Solutions , will rely on the cybersleuths at Edgeworth Security , a Pennsylvania consulting firm staffed in part by former government intelligence expert .
 The service may strike some people a overly intrusive . But this kind of scrutiny is also logical for Hollywood . Nothing stay totally secret in the social medium age — even deleted tweet — and hundred of million of dollar rest on entertainment personality .
 “ These problem are only going to grow more intense , ” said Melissa Zukerman , a partner at Principal Communications , which ha client like Marvel Studios , Imax , Legendary Entertainment and the art film studio A24 . “ It ’ s the result of a collision of two thing : a new cultural intolerance for harassment and bias ; and the accessibility of everything , from a decade of Twitter post to video taken at high school party to college term paper . ”
 Ms. Zukerman and another Principal Communications partner , Paul Pflug , pointed to the furor that broke out on Friday around Ralph Northam , the Democratic governor of Virginia , after the discovery of a racist photograph on his 1984 medical school yearbook page . Mr. Northam first acknowledged that he wa one of the people in the image , which showed a person in blackface with another in a Ku Klux Klan robe . He later reversed himself and ha refused call for his resignation .
 With Edgeworth a it partner , Foresight will have the ability to review online information in 200 language , scour social medium network , search court record and even plumb the so-called dark web . Foresight will offer multiple service , but it core offering , Red Flag , involves exhaustively scrubbing a person ’ s online footprint and recommending how to remedy anything problematic — although the firm will stop short of saying whether a person should be hired at all .
 Take the situation with Mr. Hart and the Oscars . Had Foresight existed , the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences might have contacted the firm while he wa under consideration to host . Foresight ’ s research would have turned up his circa-2010 anti-gay comment . The firm would have flagged them for the academy and provided suggestion ( should the organization still want to hire him ) to address the matter : Have an apology ready , for instance , and perhaps ask Glaad , the L.G.B.T . advocacy organization , to ass whether Mr. Hart ’ s view had changed .
 “ How might something be used a a teachable moment ? ” Ms. Zukerman said . “ If you are really going to mitigate risk , you also have to take a hard look at what reparation look like . ”
 Ms. Zukerman and Mr. Pflug would not say how much Foresight ’ s service would cost .
 There are other P.R . agency ( for instance , Glover Park Group , based in New York and Washington ) and social media-related start-ups that offer version of this service . A relatively new company called Spotted , for instance , specializes in evaluating celebrity endorsement-deal risk . “ How well do you know your celebrity partner ? ” Spotted asks on it website .
 But Foresight stand out because of it partnership with Edgeworth , which is partly owned by the former chief executive of Legendary Entertainment , and because the service come from inside Hollywood . Mr. Pflug and Ms. Zukerman have deep root in the entertainment business , having worked at studio like Universal before founding Principal Communications with Hans-Dieter Kopal in 2006 .
 Despite it Edgeworth connection , Foresight will have self-imposed limitation . In announcing the company , the partner said they would “ not accept client actively trying to avert crime or discriminatory acts. ” Mr. Pflug emphasized that Foresight would also comply with privacy law and adhere to an “ aggressive ” code of conduct .
 “ Ethics and standard have to be major guidepost , ” he said .

 Eat
 By Samin Nosrat
 When I ’ m craving a lunch that ’ s special but not fancy , or when lunchtime catch me by surprise , I head to the tiny restaurant Standard Fare in Berkeley . Run by Kelsie Kerr , one of the chef at Chez Panisse who taught me to cook , Standard Fare is mostly kitchen ; at lunchtime , customer turn the wide sidewalk into an ad hoc dining room , perching atop a row of metal stool with bowl of soup and focaccia sandwich on their lap .
 My lunch mantra is “ a many vegetable a possible , ” so I usually order the vegetarian sandwich , which is always piled high with whatever green and vegetable catch Kerr ’ s eye at the farmer ’ market , all enriched and brightened by generous dos of sauce and vinaigrette . But when I stopped in a month or so ago , the daily special of cauliflower steak with turmeric-spiced chickpea sounded equally virtuous but more satisfying . Besides , I love caramel-sweet roasted cauliflower and will take any opportunity to eat it . I wa typically harried , hungry and running late , so I felt lucky when I snagged one of the few inside seat . As I turned to scan the kitchen and gauge how long it might take the cook to prepare my lunch , Kerr brought over a plate of fried cauliflower on a bed of fragrant spiced chickpea , all showered with herb and sizzled cumin seed .
 I hadn ’ t expected the cauliflower to be fried , but I wa delighted by the way the tender , golden crust shattered in my mouth . Fried vegetable , often overbattered and undercooked , tend to disappoint me with their tough or soggy crust . This cauliflower , though , wa savory yet light . And though it had clearly been battered , it wa also somehow sweet with the sort of browning that result from long , steady roasting . I looked back at the kitchen to thank the person who ’ d done such a nice job of preparing my lunch . But no one wa frying anything ! Fried food — especially when it ’ s battered — must be cooked to order and served immediately ; otherwise it grows limp a it cool . And while there ’ s plenty of pleasure to be taken in sneaking a bite of cold , leftover fried chicken from the fridge late at night , you can not serve soggy fried chicken — or soggy anything else — at a restaurant . Especially if you ’ re Kelsie Kerr , one of the most steadfast , exacting chef the Bay Area ha ever known .
 On my way out , I asked Kerr for her recipe . I wanted to know how she had managed the technical feat of producing cauliflower that boasted the best characteristic of both roasted and fried . “ Oh , ” she responded with a knowing chuckle that sent her freckle dancing , “ it ’ s Ella ’ s recipe. ” I wa stunned . I met Ella , Kelsie ’ s lithe , red-haired daughter , in 2001 , when she could barely walk . It took me a moment to get used to the thought that she ’ s now 19 and able to develop recipe that hold muster in her mother ’ s kitchen . I begged Kerr to email me the recipe .
 What she sent seemed simple enough . Made with a mixture of brown rice and tapioca flour , the batter lacked gluten , which explained the cauliflower ’ s delicate crust . When wheat flour is mixed with water , gluten strand develop and strengthen , giving structure to a batter or dough — a characteristic desirable in a crusty loaf of bread , but le so in a light pastry or crust .
 When I tried the recipe at home , the cauliflower ’ s thin batter turned an amber lace a it fried in coconut oil . By the time I flipped each slice , the batter no longer covered the entirety of the second side , but those exposed bit of cauliflower — hugging the hot metal of the pan — took on a dark caramel color , growing extra sweet along the way .
 “ When Ella wa a high school sophomore , ” Kerr told me when I called her for the cauliflower ’ s origin story , “ she invited some friend over for dinner. ” Not wanting to intrude where she sensed she wa not welcome , Kerr kept quiet even a she watched her teenager battering and frying the cauliflower in advance . “ I remember thinking there wa no way it ’ d still be crispy that evening , but I didn ’ t say a word. ” Then , when Ella served dinner , Kerr wa taken aback . “ I thought : Holy mackerel ! This is delicious , ” she recounted with delight . “ I knew it wa a keeper because it wa a fried dish we could make ahead in batch at the restaurant and warm to order . ”
 Culinary progeny often end up in the kitchen alongside their parent , but I didn ’ t remember Ella ’ s ever showing an interest in cooking . I asked Kerr if Ella ha always liked to cook . “ She ha , but she doesn ’ t like to take advice from her mother , ” she answered dryly . “ She prefers to learn from YouTube. ” I wasn ’ t sure I heard Kerr right , so I asked her to clarify . “ Yeah , she ha all of these different YouTube cook that she love to watch. ” Bursting into laughter , I marveled at the thought . Kerr ha been cooking professionally since 1981 — probably longer than some of those YouTube chef have been alive . She ’ s one of the most accomplished , knowledgeable chef in the country . And yet , her daughter is partial to watching other folk cook online . As a student of cooking , I find this maddening . As the daughter of a steadfast , exacting mother of my own , I find it entirely relatable .
 When I asked Kerr how it made her feel to be upstaged by YouTube , her generosity surprised me , “ That ’ s Ella , ” she said . “ She ’ s so casual in her cooking . I ’ ve learned to trust her because she always doe thing I find suspicious , and they always turn out delicious . ”

 SAVE ME THE PLUMS My Gourmet Memoir By Ruth Reichl
 Spoiled for choice , Ruth Reichl fret over a major career choice . Should she accept her dream job a editor in chief of a magazine she ha loved since childhood and risk becoming a corporate creature ? Or stay put in her imperial post a restaurant critic for The New York Times ?
 We know the ending to this foodie fairy tale , but it ’ s still fun to read “ Save Me the Plums , ” Reichl ’ s poignant and hilarious account of what it took to bring the dusty food bible back to life with artistic and literary flair through the glory day of magazine-making — from 1999 to the day in the fall of 2009 when she wa informed that Condé Nast had decided to close Gourmet ’ s pantry for good .
 The first course is served when Reichl is courted at a clandestine meeting with a member of Condé Nast ’ s brass at the Algonquin Hotel , followed soon after by lunch with S.I . Newhouse at Da Silvano , the medium mogul ’ s favorite downtown watering hole , where she discovers that Newhouse despised garlic ( so much that he banned it from Condé Nast ’ s Frank Gehry-designed cafeteria ) . Undeterred by this and other eccentricity , Reichl peel away the layer of drama that arrive with her new job . ( Caution : Former editor might experience indigestion while reveling in Reichl ’ s rich serving of publishing world intrigue . )
 She wondered whether she wa up to the task of managing a large staff of editor , fact checker and art director . As 10 year of inspiring Gourmet issue and now this memoir would attest , the answer wa an emphatic yes . Magazine junky will look back in amazement at the groaning board of perk that once were staple of the job . “ Apparently they pay for everything , ” Reichl informed her husband . “ Country club … hairdresser , travel . You name it. ” Other accouterment of the position included a private office bathroom and dining room , a limo and a driver named Mustafa .
 Reichl take u through her crash course in publishing lingo a she discovers the difference between “ teeosees ” ( table of content ) , “ adjacency ” ( ad situated next to text ) and “ inadequate sep ” ( when ad are improperly spaced ) . The ultimate indoctrination into the fraternity of fat expense account come at the airport when Reichl is checking into economy class and the architecture critic Paul Goldberger , standing in the first-class line with the New Yorker editor David Remnick , reprimand her : “ You ’ re at Condé Nast now . … You shouldn ’ t be traveling like that . ”
 Working mother will sympathize with Reichl ’ s description of the exhausting rhythm of a “ dream job ” — in her case , book tour , medium interview and advertising event . One particularly touching moment come when Reichl realizes that she can ’ t make more time in her schedule for her family and weighs the ultimate compromise : “ Children , I came to understand , need you around even if they ignore you . In fact , they need you around so they can ignore you . ”
 Tantalizing recipe provide punctuation to the career twist and turn . These include the Thanksgiving turkey chili she and her staff cook for rescue worker at ground zero and the spicy Chinese noodle her young son begs her to make for him on a rare night when Reichl is finally able to fix his dinner .
 Cooks will marvel at the tasting-kitchen coup when Reichl dazzle her new staff by guessing the origin of a recipe at a blind chocolate cake test — and even suggests using a better brand of chocolate ( Scharffen Berger ) . Readers will wince at Reichl ’ s discomfort when , at a signing for a book of recipe , she is confronted by a chef about a review that cost him his job . “ ‘ “ Bitter salad , ” ’ he quoted sourly — he had memorized the entire review . ‘ “ Mushy sole . Cottony bread. ” They fired me after your hatchet job , and I haven ’ t been able to find work since . ’ ”
 Hard a a restaurant critic ’ s job can be , Reichl learns that it isn ’ t nearly a draining a navigating the business side of a magazine . She begrudgingly accepts the necessity of making sale call with publisher . Of course , the upside of dealing with corporate type is having lunch at the Four Seasons , where Reichl is taken by Steve Florio , Condé Nast ’ s chief executive . Her description of the Grill Room ’ s caviar-stuffed “ Florio potato , ” along with her account of the publisher ’ s hostile relationship with Condé Nast ’ s waiflike editorial director , James Truman , is simply delicious .
 Reichl also recount the in and out of human resource : the revolving door of publisher , the firing and hiring of staff , and how she lured talent to the magazine — including brilliant writer like Ann Patchett , who put a turtle on her expense account to save it from certain death in a market on the Amazon , and David Foster Wallace , who delivers 10,000 controversial word on the Maine Lobster Festival . Magazine maker will appreciate Reichl ’ s recipe-like telling of how the art director Richard Ferretti reinvented Gourmet ’ s cover , infusing them with cinematic clarity and drama .
 When the stock market plunge in 2008 and the housing crisis threatens newsstand sale , Reichl and her staff take a counterintuitive path and head for Paris , jettisoning the Condé Nast ethos of spending a they create an entire issue devoted to budget travel and food . A three-course meal for only 12 euro foreshadows Reichl ’ s final release from Condé Nast ’ s golden handcuff . When the waitress take the menu away , announcing that she will decide what ’ s for lunch , Reichl reflects on the barrier money can create : “ The more star in your itinerary , the le likely you are to find the real life of another country . ”
 Of course , the French know very well that true luxury is measured in portion size , and Reichl eventually loses her appetite for the hefty perk of magazine life . But before she can sign off with her painful description of the “ terrible sense of failure ” that overwhelmed her when she lost her job , each serving of magazine folklore is worth savoring . In fact , Reichl ’ s story is juicier than a Peter Luger porterhouse . Dig in .
 Kate Betts , formerly the editor in chief of Harper ’ s Bazaar , is the author of “ My Paris Dream : An Education in Style , Slang , and Seduction in the Great City on the Seine . ”

 LOVE LETTERS
 The writer Victor LaValle reflects on the power of the Oscar-nominated “ Spider-Man : Into the Spider-Verse ” and it young hero .
 By Victor LaValle
 This Valentine ’ s Day , T asked five writer to compose a love letter ( of sort ) to an actor or fictional character who ha been nominated — or , in one case , passed over — this year for the 91st Academy Awards . Here , the writer Victor LaValle , who most recently coedited the anthology “ A People ’ s Future of the United States : Speculative Fiction from 25 Extraordinary Writers ” with John Joseph Adams , share a letter to the fictional character Miles Morales of “ Spider-Man : Into the Spider-Verse , ” which ha been nominated this year for best animated feature .
 Dear Miles ,
 My kid think you ’ re great , but I ’ m the one who love you . I ’ m 47 , my son is 7 and my daughter is 5 , but at the end of “ Spider-Man : Into the Spider-Verse , ” I ’ m the only family member who sat there in tear . In the movie you look like a teenager , but in reality you ’ re barely 8 year old . Back in 2011 two folk at Marvel Comics — the artist Sara Pichelli and the writer Brian Michael Bendis — created you . In the sea of Caucasity that wa ( and still is ) the comic book industry , you were long overdue . I know this is all a bit meta , but that history wa rolling through my brain when the movie ended . Meanwhile my son and daughter were too busy pretending to turn invisible or web-sling across the Magic Johnson Theater lobby to notice . I watched them playing and thought about myself at their age . I know , I know , nothing is duller than listening to an adult talk about how thing were “ back in the day. ” I ’ m going to do it anyway so go ahead and pre-roll your eye .
 I grew up loving Peter Parker , identifying with him . I ’ m a working-class kid from Queens ; wasn ’ t raised in a “ traditional family , ” whatever the hell that mean . But Peter Parker wa the “ boy next door ” and I wasn ’ t . How did I know ? Well , because in the world of comic — the only world that mattered to me then — a boy who looked like me never lived next door . Dennis the Menace ( to use a reference you definitely don ’ t know ) could barge into his neighbor ’ s home and television audience found it endearing , cute . But a brown-skinned boy entering someone else ’ s home without knocking ha never been adorable in America . ( I guess Urkel used to do it in the ’ 90 , but look how much they had to neuter that boy in order to make such a thing palatable . )
 Which brings me back to you .
 I loved your movie from the start , but I felt a particular kind of thrill when I watched you walking to school in your uniform , passing old friend alongside a basketball court in Brooklyn . I knew that walk , had made it myself throughout my childhood . I gasped because , finally , there you were : the boy next door . But this time you were the boy who life next door to me .

 I mentioned that my kid enjoyed the hell out of the film but didn ’ t come away with the same profound emotional reaction . At first I felt offended , sat them down for a lesson on the long , problematic timeline of American comic . Superman had to assimilate to find acceptance . Wonder Woman began , in part , a a bondage fetish character . And Luke Cage , most famous these day from his ( canceled ) Netflix series , used to talk like a blaxploitation character a written by a blaxploitation software program .
 Both my son and daughter nodded along a I lectured , but they weren ’ t listening . It ’ s me who had to reckon with the math . I spent 39 year without you , but you ’ ve been a part of my kid ’ imagination for their whole life . They didn ’ t get emotional because , for them , a brown-skinned Spider-Man with big , beautiful curly hair is a commonplace . NBD . Other people may take it for granted that they have a face like a superhero ’ s . I ’ m happy my kid get to feel that way . I spent too long without such a thing ; my big feeling about you reflect how much I needed it .
 So I apologize that at the cookout and family reunion you ’ ll have to put up with uncle and aunty who pull you close and hold you too tight and get a little teary-eyed when you come around . We ’ re just so proud of you . Forgive u . Or don ’ t . I don ’ t care .
 You ’ re still getting hugged .
 Love ,
 Uncle Victor

 He refused to become a celebrity in the era of relentless puffery and self-promotion .
 By Bret Stephens

 There ’ s a short scene near the end of “ Apollo 11 , ” the thrilling new documentary about history ’ s greatest spaceflight , in which Mike Collins , Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong make a TV broadcast on their way home from the moon .
 “ We ’ d like to give a special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft , who did the construction , design , the test , and put their heart and all their ability into the [ space ] craft , ” say Armstrong . “ To those people tonight we give a special thank you . ”
 The film cut to a shot of thousand of technician assembled in an immense hangar , beaming with pride . At the zenith of his fame , the hero prof his worth by honoring those to whom the glory is truly owed .
 I watched “ Apollo 11 ” twice this week , and came away with two very different impression . What awed me the first time wa scale : The crawler-transporter that move the Saturn V rocket to the launch pad at Cape Canaveral . The rocket itself , standing 363 foot tall . People lining up for mile to watch the launch . The shuddering noise and force of liftoff . Speeds accelerating to 24,000 mile an hour . Re-entry temperature hitting 5,000 degree Fahrenheit . The smallness of Earth , the stillness of the moon , the limitlessness of space .
 Everything is immense , mind-boggling . Having been born nearly a year after the last Apollo mission took flight , I have trouble wrapping my head around it . Reality isn ’ t supposed to be this epic .
 By contrast , what I mainly noticed the second time around were the intimate side of the endeavor . The look of suppressed nervousness on Collins ’ s face a he is being suited up on the morning of the flight . Biometric data showing Armstrong ’ s heart pounding at 156 beat a minute at the moment Eagle touch down on the lunar surface , belying his reputation a Mr. Coolstone . A shadow of deep melancholy that seems to overcome Aldrin a he speaks to his family once the mission is over .
 Three men are going to try to fly to the moon . Three billion people will lionize them if they succeed ; lament ( or mourn ) them if they fail ; mock them if they screw up . No pressure .
 How do they cope ? In last year ’ s biopic , “ First Man , ” Armstrong ( played by Ryan Gosling ) is portrayed a a 1950s guy stuck in a 1960s world . Repression is the key to his emotional composure , achieved at the expense of family life . The 2007 documentary “ In the Shadow of the Moon , ” which mix footage of the Apollo mission with interview with the astronaut ( minus Armstrong ) a older men , is more revealing . Everyone is his own man ; each one deal with his fear in his own way . There ’ s more than one formula for the Right Stuff .
 But “ Apollo 11 ” offer an additional insight , particularly when it come to Armstrong . Asked by a reporter to describe his feeling “ a far a responsibility of representing mankind on this trip , ” Armstrong brings the question down to size : “ It ’ s a job that we collectively said wa possible , that we could do , and of course the nation itself is backing u , so we just sincerely hope that we measure up to that . ”
 The answer is quintessential Armstrong : He ’ s the guy who prefers to turn poetry into prose . The one time he seems least himself is when he utters the line that ’ s supposed to immortalize him : “ That ’ s one small step for man , one giant leap for mankind. ” Dropping the “ a ” before “ man ” wind up being his sole extraterrestrial mistake .
 It ’ s not that Armstrong is incapable of eloquence . It ’ s that his manner of eloquence is direct , gracious and above all modest when everyone else — Walter Cronkite and Richard Nixon in particular — strain for grandiloquence . To borrow a line from Barack Obama , he know too well that he didn ’ t build that . His sense of his place in history is that he ’ s mainly an accident of it .
 And there lie the greatest marvel of the Apollo program : Not so much the size of the endeavor , or the machine that were built to accomplish it , but rather the quality of self-effacement among the men most associated with it success . Armstrong , easily one of the most celebrated men of the last half-century , refused to become a celebrity . He kept his politics to himself . He made no oracular pronouncement . He did not amass fabulous wealth .
 He stayed humble , and human , in the era of relentless puffery and self-promotion . This , too , feel a bygone a the Saturn V , the Right Stuff , and the “ one small step ” — and a missed .
 How do we reclaim it ?
 That ’ s a moonshot-scale question , but here ’ s a worthy contribution . As I wa writing this column , I got a call from Ken Burns , a friend and renowned documentary maker , who told me about a new prize endowed by Boston philanthropist Jonathan and Jeannie Lavine in collaboration with the Library of Congress and The Better Angels Society . The award , which is currently accepting application through June 1 , will annually grant $ 200,000 to a young documentary filmmaker in the final stage of producing a feature film .
 “ We are in a situation right now where we are dialectically preoccupied : red state or blue state , gay or straight , rich or poor , male or female , ” Ken told me by way of explaining the prize ’ s significance . He ’ s looking for an antidote . “ Films that will reach a broad audience and speak to the enduring theme of what we are and what we share in common. ” Winning entry , he added , will focus on American history , be nonpartisan , “ Homeric in scope but intimate in detail . ”
 “ Apollo 11 ” is such a film . Go see it . Now , more please .

 Composers have been hired for two forthcoming blockbuster about warrior woman — “ Wonder Woman 1984 , ” directed and co-written by Patty Jenkins , and “ Mulan , ” directed by Niki Caro from a screenplay by three woman .
 The composer : Hans Zimmer and Harry Gregson-Williams . Both , plainly , dude .
 More than just a missed opportunity to lend flinty female hero a female musical voice , the announcement were simply the latest example of woman being sorely unheard in film music . A 2018 study by the University of Southern California revealed that for the top 100 fictional film at the box office every year from 2007 to 2017 , only 16 female composer were hired , compared with more than 1,200 men .
 Another report , from the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film , showed that of the top 250 film at the domestic box office in 2018 , 94 percent were scored by men .
 “ The number are bleak , but the landscape isn ’ t , ” said Laura Karpman , a veteran film composer ( “ Paris Can Wait ” ) and a governor in the music branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences . “ People are reaching out in a way that I ’ ve never seen it my whole career . ”
 Karpman wa instrumental in expanding the diversity of her branch ’ s membership , which now includes the Russian composer Sofia Gubaidulina . Karpman also spearheaded the creation of a shortlist in the score category of the Academy Awards . “ Had we had a voted-upon shortlist last year , I think we would have more diversity , ” she said . Citing the composer behind “ Get Out ” and “ Mudbound , ” she added , “ I want to see Michael Abels and Tamar-kali on Oscar shortlists. ” ( Karpman spoke before the shortlist wa announced in December . It includes Terence Blanchard ’ s score for “ BlacKkKlansman ” — his first Oscar nomination if he move to the next round — but , ala , no woman . )
 Tamar-kali is one of several new voice in a persistently white male milieu . “ Mudbound , ” directed by Dee Rees , wa the Brooklyn artist ’ s first score , which she followed with the Netflix drama “ Come Sunday. ” She ’ s also reteaming with Rees for an adaptation of the Joan Didion novel “ The Last Thing He Wanted. ” As an Afro-indigenous woman in the New York punk rock scene , she said , she wa already used to being “ an outlier within the outlier . ”
 “ It just kind of fuel your creativity , ” she explained . “ The ethos mean even more to you , because you ’ re practicing it every moment — even in the pit , even at show . ”
 Like a handful of other female artist , Tamar-kali wasn ’ t pursuing film composition , but wa commissioned after a director heard her work . Mica Levi , a British rocker from the band formerly known a Micachu and the Shapes , wa nominated for an Oscar for “ Jackie , ” which followed her shivering , queasy breakout score for “ Under the Skin . ”
 The Icelandic cellist-composer Hildur Gudnadottir wa hired for “ Sicario : Day of the Soldado ” and the forthcoming “ Joker , ” starring Joaquin Phoenix — two patently “ macho , ” big-budget feature — largely because of her experimental electronic solo work .
 “ People approach me looking for a specific type of sound , or feeling , ” Gudnadottir said . “ They don ’ t come knocking on my door for , like , a John Williams score . So that also put me in a really good position , because I ’ m normally allowed to be myself . ”
 “ Joker ” buck the trend of high-profile superhero film going solely to male composer , a doe the coming “ Captain Marvel , ” starring Brie Larson . Pinar Toprak , a Turkish composer who wrote additional music for Danny Elfman on last year ’ s “ Justice League , ” is the first woman to score a Marvel film .
 “ Music , and art in general , it ’ s genderless , ” Toprak told me in April , “ because emotion are genderless . ”
 One of the few woman who scored a major studio film in 2018 wa Germaine Franco , with the R-rated bro comedy “ Tag. ” After assisting the Oscar-nominated John Powell for year , the Mexican-American composer drew attention for giving “ Coco ” much of it musical personality — she orchestrated Michael Giacchino ’ s score and wrote several of it song , although she wa not asked to compose the score . She ’ s currently working on the Tina Gordon Chism comedy , “ Little , ” starring Marsai Martin of “ black-ish . ”
 All of this raise the question of why most studio feature — even female-centric no-brainer like the “ Ghostbusters ” reboot and “ Ocean ’ s 8 ” — still go to men .
 The history of woman scoring film isn ’ t long . The pioneer wa probably Germaine Tailleferre , a French composer who co-scored a travelogue in 1926 . Thirty year later , the American Bebe Barron created the avant-garde electronic sound for “ Forbidden Planet ” with her husband , Louis .
 Wendy Carlos ’ s seminal synthesizer album “ Switched-On Bach ” led to her collaboration with Stanley Kubrick on “ A Clockwork Orange ” and “ The Shining. ” Angela Morley wa an Oscar-nominated composer whose credit included the 1978 animated feature “ Watership Down ” and the TV series “ Dynasty ” and “ Dallas . ”
 Shirley Walker wa a pianist who helped Carmine Coppola realize his score for “ Apocalypse Now , ” and went on to shape score by Elfman and Zimmer in the 1980s and ’ 90 a an in-demand orchestrator . Both men , classically untrained , credit her a a teacher .
 Walker , who died in 2006 , also composed her own score , notably “ Batman : The Animated Series , ” the “ Final Destination ” movie and the 2003 horror film “ Willard. ” Yet she could never break into the top-tier movie she wa helping men with .
 “ I don ’ t think she got in the door for the same meeting that the guy would get , ” said Lolita Ritmanis , a composer who wa mentored by Walker . “ I wouldn ’ t say she wa bitter . She wa a fighter till the end . ”
 The first woman to win an Oscar for best score wa Rachel Portman , for “ Emma ” in 1996 . ( The only other woman to win that prize is Anne Dudley , for “ The Full Monty ” the next year . )
 The film industry , Portman said , “ tends to be quite cautious. ” She added that director feel more comfortable with composer who have “ done something really similar-sounding before — which immediately make it very difficult to break in . And also this feeling that there ’ s safety if someone else ha hired someone before , which I think is particularly hard for woman . ”
 She said she had worked with only two openly misogynistic director , and noted the occasional “ delicious challenge ” of a filmmaker presuming she ’ s not capable of writing “ tough music ” — that is , for action scene or anything in a mode not stereotypically feminine . “ I ’ m like , are you kidding ? And I ’ ll just prove to them that I can . ”
 The woman interviewed for this article offered a variety of reason for the longstanding inequality : institutionalized sexism ; a lack of precedent and female role model to inspire girl to go into the field ; and the social conditioning of woman to be selfless caretaker and not seize the spotlight .
 Increasingly , woman are entering the profession , but are still outnumbered by men . The film scoring certificate program at the University of California , Los Angeles ha produced 120 graduate since 2013 , of which only 25 percent were female . Likewise , only a quarter of applicant to the film scoring graduate program at U.S.C . this year were female — although the school invited seven woman to join it 20-student program .
 ( Portman suggested that university pumping so many aspiring composer into such a small competitive field might itself be a problem . )
 Several workshop — including the Sundance Institute Film Music Program , which ha achieved gender parity the past two year , and the Ascap Film Scoring Workshop — are trying to provide more woman with real-world experience and access to the industry . Universal Pictures started it Film Music Composer Initiative to find talented woman and people of color . Winning candidate are writing orchestral score — and running recording session at Abbey Road — for short created by DreamWorks Animation .
 Nora Kroll-Rosenbaum scored the program ’ s first short , “ Bird Karma. ” She praised the initiative for providing opportunity , adding , “ That door ha been very much shut for a lot of people . ”
 There are also new resource for support . The Alliance for Women Film Composers wa founded in 2014 , and now ha close to 400 member . It ha raised the visibility of woman through concert and advocacy work , and provides solidarity in a lonely profession with no formal union . “ It ’ s a sisterhood , it ’ s a resource , ” said Ritmanis , president of the alliance . “ And although we are very much competitor , we are also each others ’ cheerleader . ”
 “ I think because of the global awareness of woman ’ s right , and # MeToo , and Time ’ s Up and all these different movement , ” she added , “ there is an interest and a call to action ” among studio and decision maker . “ People call me wanting to meet and figure out what they can do , and I do think that there ’ s a lot more opportunity for woman to be part of the big audition process ” for major feature assignment .
 As there should be , given their talent , said Doreen Ringer-Ross , an executive in the film music division of Broadcast Music Inc. , the performing right organization which manages the catalog of many of Hollywood ’ s top composer . “ The job of a composer is to be really sensitive , is to interpret the emotion of thing , musically , ” she said . “ And woman are traditionally great at doing that . ”
 Still , emerging composer face a double standard . Jesi Nelson ha been apprenticing with several male composer a she develops her own career , and she ’ s dealt with potential boss commenting about her leg or musician assuming that she ’ s somebody ’ s personal assistant when she ’ s actually running a recording session .
 “ I do get angry , and sometimes I ’ m just like , what ’ s the point ? ” Nelson said . “ If I ’ m working these ridiculous hour — seven day a week , 18-hour day — and it ’ s paying off for somebody to diminish everything that I ’ ve worked hard for in a few word based on my gender , like , why am I even doing this ? But I love it way too much , so I won ’ t stop . ”

 In 2018 , Arielle Charnas , who make her living a a social medium influencer , partnered with Nordstrom to create a fashion and accessory line inspired by her style blog , Something Navy . When the department store introduced the collection online last fall , it website crashed . Something Navy ’ s single-day sale outsold other Nordstrom collaboration , like those with Beyoncé and Rihanna .
 Ms. Charnas , 31 , plan to attend New York Fashion Week , including those for Tom Ford , Khaite , and Ralph Lauren . This mean that her 1.1 million Instagram follower will get a glimpse of the runway world , too . She life in the Flatiron district with her husband , Brandon Charnas , 33 , who work in commercial real-estate , and their two daughter , Ruby , 2 , Esme , 8 month , and their Cavalier King Charles spaniel , Dylan .
 15 MINUTES OF PEACE No matter the day of the week , Brandon and I wake up at 7 . We don ’ t hear Ruby and Esme stirring until 7:15 , and it ’ s nice to have a few minute alone to get ourselves together and make some coffee . Once Esme start cry , I go get her while Brandon get Ruby .
 BAGEL DELIVERY We are big breakfast people and all sit around our kitchen table and eat a proper meal . I order plain bagel from Tal Bagels , which I can ’ t get enough of , through Postmates a couple time a week , and Ruby and I will often eat those with cream cheese . Brandon usually make scrambled egg with pepper and onion . I ’ ll often purée some fresh fruit for Esme .
 VIDEO-PERFECT It doesn ’ t always happen , but I try to get in a morning workout . Luckily , we have a gym in our building , and I ’ ll go there to meet my trainer Megan Roup , who I have been seeing for two year . It ’ s a 45-minute session , and we ’ ll do 15 minute of toning and 30 minute of a choreographed dance workout . I film these routine and post them on my Instagram so we ’ ll do them over and over again until they ’ re good enough to post .
 SUNDAYS IN THE PARK Unless it ’ s snowing or raining , we ’ ll all head out to one of the several park around u and spend a couple of hour there . Ruby go on the swing and slide , and Esme go on the baby swing . She ’ s also into watching the big kid play .
 THREE GENERATIONS Brandon ’ s parent live on the Upper East Side and come downtown to meet u for Sunday lunch . There are so many great place around u , and it ’ s hard to pick a spot sometimes . Shake Shack is an easy go-to . Sadelle ’ s is another favorite . I may eat a bagel again because I am obsessed with them or will get their French toast or one of their salad . I am very very close to my in-law . They ’ re so caring and helpful with the kid , and it ’ s always fun to be with them .
 SIESTA After lunch , we head back to the apartment . Ruby will sleep for an hour and a half , and Esme will sleep for three hour . Brandon ’ s parent will come home with u , and we hang out on the couch and talk some more . Or we may watch a movie , or Brandon and his dad will watch football .
 PLAY Ruby wake up around 2:30 and is ready to play . She love playing with Dylan and can ’ t enough of anything Barbie . She ’ s also into art , and I ’ ll sometimes set up her easel for her so she can paint or color . When Esme wake up , she play with Dylan , too , or will watch Ruby play .
 DINNER Occasionally , I find the time to cook , but more often than not , we end up going out to a nearby restaurant . Our favorite is this Greek place Periyali . I get the Greek salad and chicken skewer . We also both get a glass of red wine .
 COOKIE , TUB , BED Ruby will have a warm chocolate-chip cookie that we bake using premade dough , and then I give them both a bath . Ruby brings all her Barbies into the tub , and Esme hang out in her bath chair . She go to sleep around 7 , and Ruby get into bed with me and watch a cartoon or other kid ’ movie .
 SECRET SAUCE With the girl down , Brandon and I climb into bed and watch hour of TV . We love murder mystery and Marvel movie like “ The Avengers. ” It sound strange , but our late-night snack is this chopped salad that our housekeeper make during the week . It ha lettuce , pepper and cucumber , and Brandon add in turkey and cheese and whip up this incredible dressing to throw on top . I ’ ve asked him what ’ s in it , but he is shady about the recipe . We watch until I fall sleep , which is around 11 .

 Jacinda Ardern , Nancy Pelosi and the power of female grace .
 By Tina Brown
 Ms. Brown is an author , host of the podcast TBD and founder of the Women in the World summit .
 It ha been another bad inning for male leadership . Besides the hourly flatulence of Trumpian twitterings and the addition of Brazil ’ s Bolsonaro to the confederacy of bullyboy power , we have been treated to a second wave of masculine mayhem . The reputation of the Patriots owner Robert Kraft , R. Kelly , the philanthropist Michael Steinhardt and even the sainted co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center , Morris Dees , are the latest to circle the drain . As Harvard ’ s Cornel West recently observed to Anderson Cooper , “ The brother are just out of control . ”
 Can woman save the world ? A ripped Captain Marvel can rescue u from intergalactic enemy , but down here on planet Earth a new paradigm of female leadership is emerging . A year ago , Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand wa famous for being a world leader who gave birth while in office . Then came the slaughter in the Christchurch mosque and overnight the gravitas in her angular face beneath a hijab became an iconic image of global humanity . As woman across New Zealand emulated her gesture of solidarity by donning head scarf , the Arab world took note . A portrait of Ms. Ardern wa projected across the world ’ s tallest building , Dubai ’ s Burj Khalifa , with the word “ Peace ” emblazoned above it in English and Arabic .
 Countries from Georgia to Ethiopia have recently elected their first female president . Women now lead industry where once the thin air wa inhaled only by men . For the first time , woman have the top job at the New York Stock Exchange and at Nasdaq . With the ascension of Kathy Warden to C.E.O . of Northrop Grumman in January , four out of five of America ’ s biggest defense company are run by woman . Chicago is about to get it first black female mayor , and the Democratic leading light Stacey Abrams just drew a line in the sand when she squelched the idea of running for vice president with the crisp rejoinder , “ You don ’ t run for second place . ”
 Among the 42 new woman sworn into Congress , young rock star like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez electrify all of u with their passion and verve , but it ’ s Nancy Pelosi — mother of five , grandmother of nine — who know how to make the tangerine toddler in the White House eat his spinach . It ’ s salutary to watch her corral her rebellious Democratic brood with committee treat and pacifying timeouts . “ Be calm . Take a deep breath . Don ’ t become like them , ” she told her angry caucus in an emotional post-Mueller strategy session .
 I don ’ t contend that woman are naturally and invariably better at running government than men . Witness the dismal sight of Theresa May stumbling on the glass cliff of Dover last week a , for a third time , her Brexit deal went down in defeat . Yes , the British prime minister may have been better destined to be deputy headmistress of a girl ’ school in some provincial city like Salisbury , measuring the length of her pupil ’ skirt with a ruler . But the 13 Tory grandee — all male , all white — who descended on Chequers to browbeat Mrs. May yet again this month were described by a bitter London Remainer friend of mine a “ bogus patriot in crumpled suit and yesterday ’ s underpants , loving the sound of their own voices. ” Plus Mrs. May found herself in No . 10 Downing Street only because these same feckless upper-class men decided to kiss off the European Union without a clue how to achieve it .
 At a minimum , we can at least argue that woman are afflicted by what Hillary Clinton , who ha spent a lifetime with someone who lack it , once called “ the responsibility gene. ” I can bet a bucket of Bitcoins that we ’ ll never learn that any of the four married woman plausibly seeking the Democratic presidential nomination are secretly sexting picture of part of their anatomy to a boyfriend .
 But there is a deep lesson here . During thousand of year of civilization , woman have evolved to deal with the intractable perplexity of life and find mean of peaceful coexistence where men have traditionally found road to conflict . Women have accumulated rich way of knowing that until recently were dismissed in male circle of power . The alchemy of what ha made woman the way they are is mysterious : Is it a result of century spent trying to survive and prosper in society where they ’ ve been viewed a lesser ? Or , until recently , of always being appointed the family caregiver , bearing and raising child , tending to elderly parent and disabled sibling , so often left to shoulder the unpaid burden of real life ? Women have learned and taught lesson about how to cope with seeming impossibility in way that men traditionally — and to this day — have not . Coaching a slow learner on homework after a day of hassle at the office provides a deep experience of delayed gratification . A woman ’ s wisdom come , in part , from the great juggle of her life .
 Until very recently , that kind of wisdom wa banished to folkways or deprecated a secondary . But a woman step into their new role , the value of that wisdom is beginning to emerge in unexpected way . Sometimes , it ’ s a viral cultural moment that reminds u . Who will forget the image of the stoically seated CBS anchor Gayle King intoning in a soothing tone “ Robert , Robert ” to a flailing , weeping , lying R. Kelly ?
 It ’ s past time for woman to stop trying to cram themselves into outdated NASA spacesuit designed for an alien masculine physique . Salvation doesn ’ t lie in pursuing traditional male path of ejaculatory self-elevation . In drawing on woman ’ s wisdom without apology and pushing that wisdom forward into position of power , we can soothe our world and , maybe , even save it .

 THE WALL By John Lanchester
 Earlier this year , The Times reported that President Trump ’ s pledge to build a border wall had been invented by his adviser a “ a memory trick ” to keep an unpredictable candidate focused on the issue of immigration . This tell u a lot about Trump , but it also speaks to the power of the wall a a symbol , which is both monumental in it simplicity and elusive enough to sustain any number of meaning , often based — a Ursula K. Le Guin note in “ The Dispossessed ” — on which side of it the observer happens to stand .
 This is the wall that fascinated Jorge Luis Borges , who marveled that the emperor who ordered the construction of the Great Wall of China also burned all of the book in his kingdom ; and Pink Floyd , who put it on the cover of an album about a celebrity who dream of becoming a dictator . John Lanchester ’ s new novel , also called “ The Wall , ” arrives at a moment in which the definition of a wall is a matter of national debate , and it actively invite such association . As the main character say on the first page , a he search for word to describe the wall of the title , “ You look for metaphor . ”
 The narrator is a young man with the Kafkaesque name of Joseph Kavanagh . He ha just arrived at the Wall , “ a long low concrete monster ” that run for thousand of kilometer around the periphery of an unnamed island nation , closing it off completely from the outside world . All citizen are required to serve there for two year a Defenders , forming the last line of resistance against the threat of an armed invasion . This recall the Night ’ s Watch of “ Game of Thrones , ” except that the country is recognizably Britain , and the enemy on the other side aren ’ t supernatural White Walkers , but human being in rowboat and dinghy .
 As in many dystopian novel , the narrative hint at it back story through the ominous appearance in the text of unexplained proper noun — the Change , the Breeders , the Others — before revealing that an environmental cataclysm ha produced rising sea level and extreme weather across the globe . Britain , which ha been spared the worst , us the Wall — a literal Brexit — to keep out both water and unwanted immigrant . As Kavanagh make modest plan for his future , fall in love and find small form of consolation , there are shade of Kazuo Ishiguro ’ s “ Never Let Me Go , ” but trouble lie ahead , and the second half turn into an ordeal that evokes Cormac McCarthy ’ s “ The Road . ”
 Like most of it literary precursor , “ The Wall ” open long after the Change , which allows Lanchester to present his society a a given , without having to worry about the detail of the transition — a luxury granted to novelist , if not politician . The catastrophe evidently happened over a short period of time , creating a historical dividing line a decisive a the Wall itself , and everyone know whose fault it wa : “ The world hadn ’ t always been like this and … the people responsible for it ending up like this were our parent — them and their generation . ”
 This kind of moral clarity ha little to do with the real devastation wrought by climate change , which promise to be just gradual enough to allow those who caused it to avoid blame during their lifetime . Lanchester ’ s vision of an agonized cultural reckoning seems like it own sort of wishful thinking , and even if we grant his premise , many of his conclusion — like the notion that most people would stop having baby out of sheer guilt — are le than persuasive . Yet if the novel succeeds only intermittently a a parable , it ’ s gripping a a story , especially when it leaf the Wall . As Lanchester put distance between himself and his gigantic symbol , the plot grows le constrained , and the last hundred page are full of tense action and sudden reversal that are mercifully unburdened by any allegorical significance .
 The result mark a step forward for Lanchester , a formidably intelligent author who ha sometimes stumbled over his undeniable gift . His debut , “ The Debt to Pleasure , ” wa so pleased by it Nabokovian conceit — a murderer ’ s confession posing a a cookbook — that it settled for a series of variation on the same dark joke . More recently , “ Capital ” wa a credible effort at a big social novel that wa so densely reported that it character barely had room to interact or change .
 For a certain type of realistic novelist , a shift to speculative fiction — which allows the writer to invent a well a observe — can be liberating . “ The Wall ” revel in this opportunity , but it occasionally falter under Lanchester ’ s decision , which echo “ Never Let Me Go , ” to keep most of his people slightly colorless , a if to contrast their ordinary inner life with their horrific situation . In practice , the narrator ’ s restricted voice prevents u from seeing his world a clearly a we should , and we learn frustratingly little about it most vulnerable actor — the climate refugee on the far side of the Wall .
 The novel gather momentum a it go , and few reader will stop until they reach it final page . Early in the book , Lanchester toy with the idea of “ concrete poetry , ” in which a poem is typeset to look like it subject , like a house or a Christmas tree . In it closing line , like the album of the same name , the novel double back on itself to take the shape of the Wall — but it life most vividly in the place where it meticulous structure break down . Lanchester construct a more elegant wall in prose than any politician could in concrete , but the limit that it imposes on itself are still barrier , no matter how artistically designed .
 Alec Nevala-Lee is the author of the group biography “ Astounding : John W. Campbell , Isaac Asimov , Robert A. Heinlein , L. Ron Hubbard , and the Golden Age of Science Fiction . ”

 For the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame ’ s class of 2019 , pop stardom is , roughly , a tale of two gender : Powerful woman who stand proudly alone , and well-behaved group of men with too many bass player to mention .
 For it 34th annual induction ceremony on Friday night , at Barclays Center in Brooklyn , the hall opened the pantheon to Janet Jackson , Stevie Nicks , Radiohead , Def Leppard , the Cure , Roxy Music and the Zombies — a crop of respected act that have each had a palpable impact on pop culture , and who arrived at the institution with a notable lack of controversy or internecine squabble .
 But it wa the woman who left the strongest impression this year , and who made the most powerful statement at the microphone .
 Nicks , the first woman to be inducted twice — she wa already in a a member of Fleetwood Mac — kicked off the ceremony with a rundown of her solo hit like “ Stand Back ” and “ Edge of Seventeen , ” and wa joined by Don Henley for “ Leather and Lace ” and by Harry Styles for “ Stop Dragging My Heart Around , ” taking on Tom Petty ’ s vocal while strumming a Telecaster . True to her style persona , Nicks ’ s black-and-gold shawl flowed behind her , a her right hand clutched a microphone with a lacy glove .
 “ What I am doing is opening up the door for other woman to go , like , ‘ Hey man , I can do it , ” Nicks proclaimed in her speech . Before she came to the microphone , Styles — wearing a sky-blue double-breasted velvet suit — called her “ the magical Gypsy godmother who occupies the in-between . ”
 Jackson — introduced by the singer and actress Janelle Monáe a “ the legendary queen of black girl magic ” — did not perform . But she drew roar from throughout the arena a she described staking her own path apart from the dynasty of her famous brother .
 “ As the youngest in the family , I wa determined to make it on my own , ” Jackson said . “ I wanted to stand on my own two foot . But never in a million year did I expect to follow in their footstep . Tonight , your baby sister ha made it in . ”
 While Jackson spoke at length about her family , she didn ’ t mention one of the hottest topic of the past few month — “ Leaving Neverland , ” an HBO documentary about two men who say Michael Jackson sexually abused them a child ; she never said Michael ’ s name .
 [ Never miss a pop music story : Get our weekly newsletter , Louder . ]
 And the boy ? Def Leppard thanked their parent . Robert Smith of the Cure cut short his own speech to get to it performance . Bryan Ferry wa apologetic for using his time at the microphone to name so many , many name , from fellow musician to mastering engineer .
 “ Quite a long list of bass player , I ’ m afraid , ” Ferry said .
 And Radiohead wa only partly present . Its leader , the singer Thom Yorke and the guitarist Jonny Greenwood , have barely disguised their disinterest at the institution of the Rock Hall — “ I don ’ t care , ” Greenwood once said when Rolling Stone asked him about getting in — and so the five-man group wa represented only by one of it guitarist , Ed O ’ Brien , and it drummer , Philip Selway .
 “ We may not be the greatest musician around , and we ’ re certainly not the most medium friendly of band , ” Selway said . “ But we have become very adept at being Radiohead , and when that connects with people it feel amazing . ”
 In performance , Def Leppard played bad-boy pop-metal anthem like “ Hysteria ” and “ Pour Some Sugar on Me ” like a well-oiled machine , matching the musical strength of the band ’ s 1980s heyday , but without the strutting and stage leap of it old video . ( But Phil Collen , the guitarist , looked like a toned street fighter a he played shirtless and with thick chain around his neck . )
 The Cure , representing the post-punk and 1980s indie-rock era , kept the crowd in rapt attention with a playlist that spanned hit like “ Lovesong ” and “ Boys Don ’ t Cry , ” a well a oddity like the song “ A Forest ” that are just a important to the group ’ s identity .
 In his speech introducing the band , Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails called the Cure his gateway to alternative and underground music in the ’ 80 , and marveled that Smith had used his “ singular vision to create the rarest of thing : a completely self-contained world with it own rule . ”
 The night ended with a jam session featuring member of Def Leppard , the Zombies , Brian May of Queen ( who inducted Def Leppard ) , Susanna Hoffs of the Bangles ( who inducted the Zombies ) and Ian Hunter of Mott the Hoople ( who appeared to just be in the arena ) singing along to that band ’ s 1972 hit “ All the Young Dudes , ” written by David Bowie .
 Highlights from the ceremony will be broadcast by HBO on April 27 .
 In past year , the Rock Hall induction ceremony ha often been marked by complaint and rant from artist ; three year ago , Steve Miller called the induction process “ unpleasant ” and said he felt disrespected .
 This year the artist maintained a polite decorum , even when explaining their ambivalence about the institution .
 Speaking to reporter backstage , Smith said he wa “ not quite sure about the whole thing ” and that his band had , in a way , “ been subsumed into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame . ”
 But at the same time , Smith said , “ there are so many people who have done this that I admire so hugely , who have inspired me so much , that it would be really , really wrong of me to be anything other than delighted . ”
 The sharpest criticism wa also the most encouraging , addressing the Rock Hall ’ s poor record of including woman . According to one count , of the 888 people who have been inducted over the hall ’ s history , just 69 of them , or le than 8 percent , have been woman .
 Wrapping up her speech , Jackson gave the hall a nudge .
 “ Rock & Roll Hall of Fame , ” she said , “ 2020 — please induct more woman . ”
 An earlier version of this article misstated which instrument Ed O ’ Brien play in Radiohead . He is a guitarist , not a bassist .

 The documentary “ Apollo 11 ” — playing in select IMAX theater now , before opening more widely in regular cinema on Friday — is one of the most rousing movie ever made about NASA and space exploration . The director Todd Douglas Miller and a team of archivist and editor found rare footage of the original manned lunar landing mission , and compiled it into a film that ’ s an immersive and inspiring record of the voyage , from launch to splashdown .
 But “ Apollo 11 ” is far from the only great documentary about humanity ’ s effort to explore beyond Earth ’ s atmosphere . The “ space doc ” is a small but fertile nonfiction cinema subgenre , populated by filmmaker who often partner with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to combine astonishing image with recollection from the small handful of men and woman who have dared to venture to the star .

 The gold standard for NASA documentary , this Oscar-nominated 1989 film is rich with the alien wonder of a trip to the moon . The director Al Reinert wa granted access to footage shot by astronaut during the various Apollo mission , and he and his editor ( led by Susan Korda ) cut them into an approximation of a single voyage , with a focus on scene that are eerie and awe-inspiring . With it score by the ambient music pioneer Brian Eno , Roger Eno and Daniel Lanois — and it narration provided by the original Mission Control audio recording , combined with reflective astronaut interview — “ For All Mankind ” evokes the grand science-fiction adventure of Apollo . ( For a more straightforward , le experimental account of the program , the 2007 British documentary “ In the Shadow of the Moon ” is also highly recommended . It ’ s available to stream for free on the ad-supported Tubi . )

 As a bittersweet bookend to “ Apollo 11 , ” watch this documentary about the final moon mission , and see how it changed the life of it commander , Eugene Cernan . The director Mark Craig keep his film fairly equally divided between the personal , professional and political side of Cernan ’ s NASA career . “ The Last Man on the Moon ” cover the public ’ s growing frustration with the expense of the space program , and also get into the technical complexity of that last trip in 1972 , and into how an astronaut ’ s job conflict with family life . This is the rare space-doc that ’ s also a poignant character sketch . And it doesn ’ t lack for great lunar footage , either . Apollo 17 had access to color video camera far beyond what Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin worked with , and the image Cernan and his crew captured on the moon are stunning in their clarity .

 When NASA launched it two deep-space Voyager probe in 1977 , the mission sparked conversation among scientist , artist , philosopher and ordinary folk , all wondering what information about Earth should be sent out into the universe , and what data — or even communication — might come back from the distant planet and star . The director Emer Reynolds ’ s documentary “ The Farthest ” describes the work that went into crafting these enduring marvel of mid- ’ 70 technology , which are still zooming away out there . The film is a reminder of the idealism and optimism of the people who worked in the space program over 40 year ago , and serf a a call to recapture their spirit and ingenuity .

 Manned space exploration ha slowed lately , but the nonprofit organization the Mars Generation ha been working since 2015 to keep the next wave of astronaut and rocket scientist ready anyway , just in case . The documentary “ The Mars Generation ” introduces some brilliant , space-obsessed teen , who take part in special camp designed to simulate what it might be like to travel to and even live on Mars . These kid are sometimes socially awkward , but always sweetly earnest . It ’ s heartwarming to watch them work together toward a goal they may never achieve in real life , unless the public broadly support another big , expensive project on the scale of the Apollo mission .

 How about a little historical “ what if ? ” In 1960 , the NASA adviser Dr. William Randolph Lovelace II began an experiment to see if ace female pilot could endure the series of physical and mental challenge he had originally devised for the “ Mercury Seven ” astronaut . When he discovered that some woman scored higher on some test than the men , the privately funded “ Woman in Space ” program started lobbying the medium and the U.S. government , arguing that in order to compete with the Soviets in the space race , America needed to overcome it deep-rooted sexism . The documentary “ Mercury 13 ” feature interview with some of the accomplished pilot and scientist who worked on this project , many of whom remain certain that the space program — and perhaps even the culture — might have been different if NASA had been more open to Lovelace ’ s experiment .

 Participants in virtual race run whenever they can , wherever they can , and say they still have some of the sense of being part of a crowd , even if they ’ re running alone .
 By Jen A. Miller
 On a recent Sunday morning , Kate Silvester ran a 5K . She didn ’ t have to worry about where to park to get to the starting line in time : She just headed out to a biking and running path behind her house and onto a back road .
 Her race wa a virtual 5K associated with the NYC Half , which wa run in New York the same day .
 Virtual challenge and run are part of a growing trend in recreational running : doing a race whenever you can , wherever you can , and still feeling a if you ’ re part of the crowd , even if you ’ re running alone .
 Bob Bickel , founder of the race registration platform Run Sign Up , said the organization saw virtual race pop up “ in earnest ” about five year ago . One of the first popular virtual run , he said , wa that of Jeff Galloway , a running coach who train runner using a run-walk-run method . In 2018 , 1,050 people finished Mr. Galloway ’ s virtual event , which included a 5K and half marathon .
 “ People are used to running with their apps , and I think more and more people are comfortable with connecting virtually , ” Mr. Bickel said , “ whether it ’ s on Facebook or Instagram or Snapchat , people can actually have friendship even though they don ’ t see each other . ”
 Ms. Silvester , 44 , of Plainsboro , N.J. , said her first virtual run came through the tracking app Run Keeper . In 2017 , she wa new to the sport , and she ’ d been using the app to track her progress . She saw that she could participate in a “ challenge ” event , where runner who donated $ 35 to Beat Nb , a nonprofit that fund research for the childhood cancer neuroblastoma , got a T-shirt for completing the run .
 She ’ d done traditional race before , but a a single mother of two who work full time , she liked the flexibility of something virtual .
 Virtual run are structured in various way .
 Disney ’ s Virtual Run 5K series started in 2016 and us the honor system . Runners can download bib to wear to do the virtual run . When they finish one — or all — of the three 5Ks in the series , they can download a finisher ’ s bib and are mailed a medal .
 “ It wa an interesting opportunity for u to really keep people involved with runDisney year round , ” said Faron Kelley , vice president of Disney Sports . Most on-site runDisney event are held in cooler month , so the Virtual Run 5K series is held in the summer . Last year ’ s series , which wa themed to “ The Incredibles , ” had about 18,000 participant . This year ’ s series , with registration opening on May 7 , is Marvel themed , with each 5K costing $ 40 ; doing all three , which includes a fourth medal for completing them all , cost $ 145 . RunDisney also put on a virtual Star Wars Half Marathon in the winter and early spring — for 2019 , it cost $ 59 ( and is open through March 31 ) .
 The Great Pumpkin Run virtual race series also us the honor system . For $ 35 , runner are mailed a race hoodie and a bib . Previously , the race sent race medal after runner submitted their time , but this year , Courtney Young , co-founder of the race , said medal will be mailed along with the hoodie and bib . “ People want that instant gratification , ” she said . Ms. Young said the race ha also worked with Strava , an exercise tracking app , but it ’ s not a requirement ; they trust that runner aren ’ t lying .
 The Great Pumpkin Run started a a traditional race series in 2012 , but the virtual option ha taken off since it wa introduced in 2016 . The first year , 300 runner did the virtual option ; last year there were close to 14,000 . “ I think it ’ s helping people get into the sport , ” Ms. Young said . It appeal to runner who may not be able to show up to a race on a certain time and day , or who are intimidated by running with other people in their first race .
 The New York Road Runners added virtual run to it race roster in 2018 , and this year it ha 12 , most themed to a holiday or event , like the Resolution Run 5K or the Valentine ’ s Duo 5K . It also had a virtual half marathon and 5K connected to last weekend ’ s NYC Half , the one Ms. Silvester ran .
 The New York Road Runners ’ virtual race are free , unless runner are using them a a way to get into a sellout race . In 2018 , the organization opened 500 spot for runner to run a virtual marathon , which , if they completed it , would get them a race medal and guaranteed entry into the New York City Marathon this year ( it cost $ 150 , compared to $ 295 to run in the actual marathon ; they also got a finisher medal but no finisher shirt ) . For guaranteed entry into the 2020 Brooklyn Half Marathon , runner can sign up for and complete each of six virtual race , at $ 20 per race . They also get access to a virtual trainer a part of their fee .
 While runner can use whatever GPS watch or app they want to track their run , they must upload it into the Strava app in order for it to count .
 The virtual run started with the question of “ how can we continue to engage and extend our impact across the global running community and provide way in which people can run with u without being here in New York City ? ” said New York Road Runners president and chief executive Michael Capiraso .
 For Ms. Silvester , Sunday ’ s virtual run wa part of her recovery from an injury . “ It wa only my third run since getting back from injuring my hip flexor , so I took it pretty slow and included walk break , but I did it , ” she said .
 She ’ s hoping to do the Brooklyn Half next year , which would be her first half marathon . “ It ’ s hard to picture myself getting to a half marathon in the next year or so , but it wa good to get back into running after a long break , ” she said .

 Adam Driver is a great disrupter .
 This volcanic actor ’ s entrance in the lopsided new revival of Lanford Wilson ’ s “ Burn This , ” which opened on Tuesday at the Hudson Theater , is prefaced by a fanfare of violent pounding . It is 5 a.m. , in a loft in Lower Manhattan . And it sound a if the Incredible Hulk , feeling very impatient , is in the hallway — or maybe a runaway cyclone .
 When the door open , what is revealed behind it doe not disappoint . With long , flailing limb and a face molten with anguish , Mr. Driver explodes into view with an outsize fury that make everyone and everything around him seem Lilliputian . And a production that ha so far felt pleasant and prosaic is flooded with the anarchy of life in extremis .
 The last time I can recall such an impressively violent Broadway entrance wa more than 30 year ago , when a rising actor named John Malkovich appeared in the same part . Playing a coked-to-the-gills restaurant manager named Pale , Mr. Malkovich seemed to morph overnight from quirky character actor into a leading man of dangerous sex appeal .
 Theater lover still talk about the excitement of that performance . And I would wager that decade from now , people will be speaking with the same gratified wonder of Mr. Driver ’ s very different but equally compelling Pale .
 Though he ha appeared on Broadway before , it ha been in supporting role in period British drama — “ Mrs . Warren ’ s Profession ” ( 2010 ) and “ Man and Boy ” ( 2011 ) — that fitted him like genteel straitjacket . With “ Burn This , ” directed by Michael Mayer and co-starring Keri Russell , he is finally allowed to unfurl onstage the distinctive energy and insight that have characterized his subsequent performance in film ( the current “ Star Wars ” series ) and television ( HBO ’ s “ Girls ” ) .
 That unleashed force is plied most artfully here to create a portrait of how grief unhinges , disarranges and heightens everyday life . Set in the late 1980s , “ Burn This ” ass the impact of the death of a young dancer named Robbie , Pale ’ s brother , in a boating accident .
 The tragedy brings Robbie ’ s roommate , Anna ( Ms. Russell , in the part for which Joan Allen won a Tony in 1988 ) and Larry ( Brandon Uranowitz ) , a well Anna ’ s boyfriend , Burton ( David Furr ) , into contact with someone they might otherwise never have met . That ’ s Pale , a product of working-class New Jersey who ha had little recent contact with the much younger , artistic-minded and gay Robbie .
 [ Adam Driver and Keri Russell on the appeal of ‘ Burn This . ’ ]
 The play begin shortly after Robbie ’ s funeral . Anna , who ha recently made the transition from dancing to choreography , ha returned to their apartment , a loft space a open a a dance studio and a lonely a a desert . ( Derek McLane designed the set , lighted with a brooding clarity by Natasha Katz . ) Having just met Robbie ’ s family for the first time , she ’ s marveling at how she could have known so little about someone she thought she knew so well .
 The opacity of people — even to themselves — is a leitmotif in “ Burn This. ” So is the hunger to reach beyond the ordinary , to see and feel on an epic scale . Burton , a rich-boy screenwriter , and Anna speak of creating work that wrests them from the rut of what they ’ ve always done . They need , in Burton ’ s word , “ to reach for the sun . ”
 As embodied by Mr. Driver , Pale isn ’ t reaching for the sun ; he ’ s a solar entity unto himself . You believe him when he say his normal body temperature is about 110 degree and that “ I got like a toaster oven that I carry around in my belly someplace . ”
 Addled with drug and drink , rabid with grief and guilt , Pale arrives — in the play ’ s second scene , to collect his brother ’ s belonging — a a flesh-and-blood example of life lived large . He ’ s an alien in the civilized Bohemia of the others .
 He ’ s even an alien to himself , wrestling in exasperation with his own body , which register emotion a physical pain , and the Armani-style dud he always wear . ( Clint Ramos did the era-appropriate costume . ) Even more than Mr. Malkovich did , Mr. Driver make u aware that real grandeur doesn ’ t always come in the expected , esthetically pleasing package .
 If Mr. Driver bestrides “ Burn This ” like a colossus — could he really be only 6-foot-2 , a Wikipedia ha it ? — everyone else seems to shrink beneath his shadow when he ’ s onstage . You could argue that this is appropriate .
 But earlier production — including the 2002 Signature Theater revival , which starred Edward Norton and Catherine Keener — made it clear that this drama is indeed a “ pa de quatre , ” to use the language of dance , about the distance among people . In Mr. Mayer ’ s version , the play might be titled “ Waiting for Pale . ”
 This is partly because Ms. Russell , a first-rate television actress ( “ The Americans ” ) , never seems in any way undone — not by sorrow , not by creative frustration and not by her character ’ s gravitational attraction to Pale , with whom she fall into bed almost immediately . She tell Pale that he scare her .
 Yet despite her physical daintiness in comparison to Mr. Driver ’ s looming heft , her Anna always seems in charge , like a nanny with an unruly , overgrown toddler . To borrow from Lady Gaga , Ms. Russell ’ s performance remains comfortably “ in the shallow , ” instead of in the deep end into which Anna is plunged .
 [ What ’ s new onstage and off : Sign up for our Theater Update newsletter ]
 When she deftly swap chummy barb with Mr. Uranowitz — who ably fill the now shopworn role of the sardonic but ultimately wise and caring gay confidant — “ Burn This ” can feel like a dry run for the long-lived TV series “ Will and Grace. ” And the most intriguing erotic chemistry here isn ’ t between Pale and Anna , but between Larry and Mr. Furr ’ s straight ( and very good ) Burton .
 I hasten to add that Mr. Driver isn ’ t grandstanding at the expense of the rest of the cast . Part of the pleasure of watching him come from seeing how this overwrought lug relates so awkwardly and unnaturally to others . When he kiss Anna goodbye , it ’ s with the stiffness of a little boy unaccustomed to display of affection .
 But this “ Burn This , ” which is steeped in the rich compassion for the lonely and lost that is the hallmark of work by Mr. Wilson ( 1937-2011 ) , only rarely stir the heart . In the ideal production , it creates the sense of fire meeting fire in a folie à deux between two ill-matched yet inexorably bound lover . What we have in this case is a one-man conflagration .

 The four film actor who won top honor from the Screen Actors Guild last year all went on to win the Oscar .
 So did the four who won the year before that .
 With this in mind , and the knowledge that actor make up the biggest voting branch in the academy , at least some of the winner at Sunday night ’ s SAG Awards should feel confident about repeating their victory at the Oscars next month .
 Take Glenn Close in “ The Wife ” and Rami Malek in “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” : After both added SAG trophy to Golden Globes they already picked up , they should be considered leading contender for best actress and best actor .
 [ Fill out your Oscar ballot here . ]
 Ditto Mahershala Ali , who won the SAG Award for best supporting actor for “ Green Book ” on Sunday and , after winning the same award two year ago for “ Moonlight , ” join Daniel Day-Lewis a one of only two men to win more than one SAG Award for film acting . Ali is now almost certain to take the Oscar in that category .
 But what of Emily Blunt , who won the supporting-actress SAG Award for her work in “ A Quiet Place ” but ha yet to score even her first Oscar nomination ? The fact that the academy continues to snub this popular performer may explain why the actor guild rallied to her defense , but it ’ s also another sign that the supporting-actress category offer one of this year ’ s most unpredictable race .
 “ If Beale Street Could Talk ” star Regina King ha taken home two televised award in this category — the Golden Globe and Critics ’ Choice Award — yet wa not even nominated by SAG or Bafta , the British award group that many consider to be an across-the-pond analogue to the Oscars . The only performer to ever win the Oscar despite snub from those two group is Marcia Gay Harden for the 2000 biopic “ Pollock . ”
 That would seem to open up a path to victory for Amy Adams , who ha earned six Oscar nomination in her career and is recognized again this year for playing Lynne Cheney in “ Vice. ” She ha never won the Oscar and most pundit expected that with King not up for a SAG , Adams would at least take that prize on Sunday . For Adams to still lose to Blunt may indicate that while she is well-liked by her fellow actor , Cheney isn ’ t the role they want to give Adams the Oscar for .
 There is still one more crucial stop on the way to Oscar , and that is the Baftas on Feb. 10 . Adams may finally take that award , given just two day before Oscar voting begin , or the race may throw u another curveball : Many Bafta voter have told me they are inclined to reward Rachel Weisz for “ The Favourite. ” No matter how locked up the other three acting category appear , at least the supporting-actress Oscar race will keep u in suspense until the end .
 The same go for best picture . Around half the time , the SAG winner for best ensemble go on to win the top Oscar , but two of this year ’ s biggest best-picture threat — “ Green Book ” and “ Roma ” — failed to crack SAG ’ s ensemble category . It ’ s incredibly rare to win best picture without that key SAG nomination , though one of the two film to ever buck that stat came just last year with “ The Shape of Water . ”
 SAG gave it ensemble award to “ Black Panther , ” the Marvel Studios phenomenon that recently became the first superhero film nominated for the best picture Oscar . Is that enough for “ Black Panther ” to cruise to the same Academy Award win ? I ’ m inclined to say no , because it ’ s borderline impossible for a film to win best picture without nomination for director , screenplay or any cast member — all category “ Black Panther ” couldn ’ t penetrate .
 Still , this is a wild , anything-can-happen award season , and even the two presumed front-runner come with significant baggage : No foreign-language film ha ever won best picture , potentially limiting “ Roma , ” while “ Green Book ” ha had to weather more controversy than any other contender and missed out on a best-director nomination .
 So the race remains fluid , especially because two other best-picture candidate — “ A Star Is Born ” and “ BlacKkKlansman ” — were nominated by the most industry guild , signaling strong across-the-board support even if both film have still struggled to notch a high-profile win . In a year when the particular of the Oscar ceremony itself seem impossible to pin down , perhaps it ’ s fitting that the best-picture race remains equally confused .

 Elias M. Stein , a mathematician who pioneered work in a field that wa originally devised to describe the vibration of string but that proved to have a wide range of application , including charting the fluctuation of stock market and gravitational wave , died on Dec. 23 at a hospital in Somerville , N.J . He wa 87 .
 The cause wa complication of lymphoma , his daughter , Karen , said .
 Dr. Stein “ had a knack of asking the right question , ” said Terence Tao , a professor of mathematics at the University of California , Los Angeles , who wa a graduate student of his . “ He had this great vision of where mathematics should go . ”
 Dr. Stein ’ s specialty wa harmonic analysis , which break mathematical function into a spectrum of simple component . It ha been known for a long time that a musical note , for example , is a combination of pure harmonic tone . The basic technique of harmonic analysis , devised century ago , were used to compute phenomenon like the orbit of planet , the vibrating of string and the property of radio signal .
 Dr. Stein showed how a similar approach could be applied to other problem and reveal hidden structure and pattern .
 Instead of trying to compute exact solution to a problem — which can be a hopelessly arduous task — harmonic analysis can often produce quicker but still useful estimate . “ It ’ s a very different style of mathematics , ” Dr. Tao said in an interview . “ He pushed this style of thinking . ”
 Charles Fefferman , a mathematics professor at Princeton who wa another of Dr. Stein ’ s graduate student , said some of Dr. Stein ’ s early work developed fundamental tool that later turned out to be useful in figuring out how to compress image and sound recording .
 Another equation that Dr. Stein studied ha since been applied to the fluctuation in stock price .
 Elias Menachem Stein wa born on Jan. 13 , 1931 , in Antwerp , Belgium . In 1940 , when he wa 9 , German troop invaded Belgium , and the Steins , who were Jewish , fled to the United States . Elias arrived with diamond in the sol of his shoe ; his father , a diamond merchant , had hidden them there .
 His family settled on the Upper West Side of Manhattan .
 Elias ’ s interest in mathematics wa kindled at Stuyvesant High School . In an interview conducted for the Simons Foundation in 2012 , he recalled that member of Stuyvesant ’ s math club had to do two thing . One wa to read an advanced mathematics textbook . The other wa to steal a math book from Barnes & Noble ’ s flagship store at Fifth Avenue and 18th Street .
 “ That is something I did , ” Dr. Stein said . “ As it turn out , it wasn ’ t a very valuable book . ”
 He pursued mathematics at the University of Chicago , where he received a bachelor ’ s degree in 1951 , a master ’ s in 1953 and a doctorate in 1955 .
 After working a an instructor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Dr. Stein returned to the University of Chicago a an assistant professor in 1958 . In 1963 he moved to Princeton , where he spent the rest of his career . He retired in 2012 , although he continued to teach class .
 He wa a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences . He received a National Medal of Science in 2002 , bestowed by President George W. Bush .
 In addition to his daughter , Dr. Stein is survived by his wife of 59 year , Elly Stein ; a brother , Daniel ; a son , Jeremy ; and three grandchild .
 Throughout his career , Dr. Stein advised more than 50 graduate student — a large number for a math professor . Two of his student , Dr. Tao and Dr. Fefferman , later won the Fields Medal , often considered the Nobel Prize of mathematics .
 Dr. Tao marveled at Dr. Stein ’ s well-constructed lecture . “ Math lecture are often very dry , ” he said . “ It ’ s always definition and theorem . He almost made it like an episodic TV show . Every hour had a setup , a good guy and a bad guy , and action , and the good guy win at the end . ”
 Lillian Pierce , a mathematics professor at Duke , took a class taught by Dr. Stein during her freshman year at Princeton . It wa a standard course taken by mathematics major about the underpinnings of calculus .
 “ It ’ s really because I took that class from him that I made the jump to think , ‘ Ah , I think I want to pursue mathematics above everything else , ’ ” she said in an interview . “ I then took all the course that he taught during those four year . ”

 Living With Cancer
 As a patient who grappled with an ostomy , I grieved the suicide of a 10-year-old whose family said he wa bullied for having one .
 By Susan Gubar
 We don ’ t always know the people we mourn . This winter , an online message board for people with ostomy filled with comment deploring heartbreaking news from Kentucky . A 10-year-old boy named Seven Bridges took his life in January , apparently because of bullying related to his having had a colostomy .
 This child ha something to teach those of u stunned by his death , I thought . But what ?
 Seven wa born with a birth defect that necessitated multiple surgery , including a colostomy : a piece of the colon pulled through the abdominal wall to create what is called a stoma . Stool , moving from the intestine through the stoma , collect in a pouch attached to the belly .
 News report said that Seven had the procedure reversed but continued to have trouble with leakage . His parent , Tami Charles and Donnie Bridges , told reporter that resulting odor triggered classmate ’ aggression .
 More specifically , they say that schoolmate subjected Seven , who wa African-American , to racist insult and choking . They had lodged complaint with the school and were looking forward to his making a fresh start in a new school for the sixth grade .
 But the damage took it toll before he had a chance to try : He hanged himself .
 It is impossible to register the horror of that event .
 Children with disability are often targeted by bully . What courage Seven must have evinced in his elementary school year , I marvel while recalling how disoriented I initially felt living with a stoma . An ostomy abrogates our fundamental assumption of bodily autonomy .
 I wa 64 when ovarian cancer necessitated an ileostomy , an operation involving the small intestine . The act of excretion could no longer be controlled . Evacuation occurs incessantly , from the front of the body . What should be inside and hidden — a bit of intestine — is outside and visible . Learning how to clean myself and replace the pouch required the supervision of a home nurse . I dreaded leak .
 Wasn ’ t I too well schooled to be ashamed of a medical intervention that saved my life ? No , not really . Self-loathing had me in it grip . Although hidden beneath clothing , the stoma made me feel defective .
 Even if Seven had found strategy to mitigate the self-shame that clamped down on me , the shame inflicted by others would have been appalling . Shaming is most effective with those liable to internalize it . Bullies frequently target schoolmate who have labored against feeling humiliated by whatever difference might mark them : looking fat or skinny , short or tall , foreign or queer . All sort of difference must be negotiated by all of our child at their , and our , peril .
 However , the difference manifested by an ostomy remains so taboo that it horrifies even educated adult . “ I would rather be dead , ” people say about the prospect of a bag . Excrement is conflated with the stink of mortality , the waste to which we will be reduced after death . For this reason , ostomy generally remain shrouded in secrecy . They are not easy to address .
 The fate of Seven Bridges lead me to reconsider the objection of a reader of my book “ Memoir of a Debulked Woman , ” who wa angered by my account of the mortification I experienced after ostomy surgery .
 Like many people with stoma , she prided herself on being a happy , productive individual . Ostomies , which relieve terrible abdominal pain a well a recurrent and debilitating diarrhea or constipation , free patient to actively pursue fulfilling goal . My testimony , she argued , would unduly alarm and harm those facing this operation .
 Is shame so toxic an emotion that articulating it promotes it ? Yes , I concede , shame may be contagious . In an effort to grapple with my shame , I express it and you , recognizing our commonality , catch it . Ought I therefore be ashamed of my shame and stifle it expression ?
 But silence can intensify shame , just a shame can intensify silence . On the school bus , it fails to wrest language from bully who engage in shaming .
 Regrettably , unashamed language sometimes also backfire . If a school counselor had instructed Seven ’ s classmate on his medical state — would he have wanted that ? — they might have empathized with him . Or they might have misused the conveyed information to hone their attack . Perhaps we need more talk in school not about victim but about bully whose abusive behavior ward off intimation of their own abiding sense of shame .
 In fact , though , Seven ’ s story focus my attention on the often invisible burden of child , adolescent , adult and senior who undergo temporary or permanent ostomy : those born with congenital birth defect a well a those dealing with injury or with inflammatory bowel disease , ulcerative colitis , diverticulitis , Crohn ’ s disease , or bladder , colorectal and gynecological cancer . About 500,000 Americans .
 Seven ’ s story discloses the vicious vise of shame and the need for resource to escape it .
 Instantly I go into didactic overdrive . Younger and older patient should be encouraged to meet periodically with mentor — ostomy nurse ( bless them ! ) tend to be brilliant , but seasoned patient a well — who can assist with the physical , psychological and social trial that arise . Seven Bridges did not have the time to discover that the longer one life with a stoma , the easier it becomes … partly because of the information , advice and camaraderie now available online .
 After notice of his death appeared on news outlet , teen and young adult who had undergone ostomy operation began conveying their condolence and promoting body acceptance by recounting their own struggle with shame . On Instagram , under the hashtag # BagsOutforSeven , some shared photo of themselves with pouch . Their brazen dignity rebuff not only stoma stigma but also the practice of stigmatizing any sort of physical difference .
 They undoubtedly realize , a I do too , that we are all so much more than our embodiment . Let ’ s commemorate Seven Bridges for his transmission of obdurate truth with which we must contend . His parent honor him with their tradition , a I seek to honor them with mine . May his memory be a blessing .
 Susan Gubar , who ha been dealing with ovarian cancer since 2008 , is distinguished emerita professor of English at Indiana University . Her latest book is “ Late-Life Love . ”

 LOS ANGELES — “ Everything the light touch is our kingdom . ”
 It ’ s a line from Disney ’ s “ The Lion King , ” spoken by Mufasa to young Simba a they sit atop Pride Rock . And on Wednesday morning , just after midnight on the East Coast , it seemed to describe the Walt Disney Company itself , a the conglomerate closed it $ 71.3 billion acquisition of 21st Century Fox asset . It is now an entertainment colossus the size of which the world ha never seen .
 The ripple effect may not become clear for year . Analysts say that Disney could force smaller studio to merge a they scramble to compete . It will have greater leverage over theater owner when it come to box office split . And Disney ’ s plan to use Fox content to forcefully move into streaming could slow the growth of Netflix .
 “ This deal definitely reshapes the landscape , ” said Michael Nathanson , a leading medium analyst .
 Disney now owns most of Rupert Murdoch ’ s former empire , including the 20th Century Fox movie and television studio , which includes the “ X-Men , ” “ Avatar ” and “ Simpsons ” franchise ; Blue Sky , the “ Ice Age ” animation studio that is based in Connecticut ; the National Geographic and FX cable network ; most of the streaming service Hulu ; and Star , a fast-growing television-service provider in India .
 Disney had been a mere behemoth , dominating sport television through ESPN , controlling the global theme park business and running Hollywood ’ s No . 1 movie operation , with studio that include Marvel , Pixar and Lucasfilm . But the company decided that it needed to bulk up even more a the tech giant aggressively moved into Hollywood . The competition now includes Apple , which is scheduled to unveil it television and movie plan on Monday .
 “ This is an extraordinary and historic moment for u , ” Robert A. Iger , Disney ’ s chief executive , said in a statement on Tuesday .
 Mr. Iger ha staked his legacy on this deal , and he had to fend off an aggressive play by Comcast on two continent to gain control of Mr. Murdoch ’ s trove . ( Mr. Iger ultimately lost Sky , the British pay-television company . ) The acquisition is the largest in Disney ’ s 96-year history , dwarfing even the 1995 purchase of Capital Cities / ABC . That cost $ 19 billion ( about $ 32 billion in today ’ s money ) and , because it included ESPN , served a a growth engine for Disney for two decade .
 The Fox asset are meant to do the same for Disney in the year ahead . Disney is now trying to become le dependent on cable channel like ESPN , which are in slow , steady decline owing to cord-cutting . Instead , Disney ha decided to move into the rapidly growing realm of online video , a direct-to-consumer business defined by Netflix . Mr. Iger belief that the Fox asset will enhance that plan , which includes a streaming service called Disney+ later this year .
 “ The pace of disruption ha only hastened , ” Mr. Iger told The New York Times in an interview when the deal wa announced . “ This will allow u to greatly accelerate our direct-to-consumer strategy , which is our highest priority . ”
 The challenge are daunting . Mr. Iger and his lieutenant need to persuade investor to start viewing Disney more like a technology company , where near-term financial turbulence is often overlooked . Integrating the Fox asset will bring headache that include substantial layoff — analyst project more than 3,000 — and the melding of two starkly different corporate culture . When the deal wa announced in December 2017 , James L. Brooks , a creator of “ The Simpsons , ” posted an image on Twitter that showed an angry Homer Simpson strangling Mickey Mouse .
 To win approval from antitrust regulator around the world , Disney had to agree to modest concession .
 It is already deep in the process of selling Fox ’ s 22 regional sport channel , a move required by the Justice Department . The Yankees teamed with Amazon this month , for instance , to buy the YES Network , which serf the New York metropolitan area , for roughly $ 3.5 billion . To appease European regulator , Disney agreed to divest a stake in A+E Networks , which include the History channel . ( Disney will retain 50 percent ownership of the division in the United States ; Hearst owns the other half . )
 The final sticking point came from Brazil and Mexico . Regulators in those country are forcing Disney to sell Fox Sports , a competitor to ESPN that hold extensive right to televise soccer match . Brazil ’ s antitrust regulator , Cade , said in a statement that operating both channel would give Disney too much control of the sport TV market in the country . Mexico ’ s telecommunication regulator , IFT , held a similar view and added stipulation about Disney ’ s ownership of the National Geographic and Nat Geo Wild channel .
 At Disney ’ s annual meeting this month , Mr. Iger said the 20th Century Fox and Fox Searchlight label — trumpet fanfare included — would continue to exist . That decision pleased Hollywood , but it could lead to consumer confusion since Mr. Murdoch retained ownership of the Fox broadcast network , a chain of local Fox television station and his crown jewel , Fox News . Those business , along with the FS1 sport channel , were rolled into a new publicly traded company , Fox Corporation , on Tuesday .
 Paul D. Ryan , the former Republican congressman from Wisconsin who served a speaker of the House from October 2015 to January 2019 , joined the Fox board on Tuesday . Other board member include Mr. Murdoch and Roland A. Hernandez , a former chief executive of Telemundo . Mr. Murdoch ’ s oldest son , Lachlan , serf a the new company ’ s chief executive .
 The Murdochs are expected to receive roughly $ 12 billion in proceeds from the Disney deal , according to Bloomberg . Shareholders in the asset that were sold to Disney had the option to accept Disney share or cash out . Disney said on Friday that , based on initial result of that process , holder of about 52 percent of share asked for cash and 37 percent asked for Disney share . The balance did not make a request .

 Director Ryan Coogler and his female department head helped bring “ Black Panther ” to life . Will they get the credit they ’ re due ?

 On a Thursday evening in October , a the Oscar campaign for “ Black Panther ” began to unfurl , Kathleen Kennedy took the microphone in a packed room of award voter . The Lucasfilm president had volunteered to host a reception for “ Black Panther ” at the London hotel in West Hollywood , and her eye alighted on the 32-year-old director Ryan Coogler .
 “ Ryan Coogler ’ s dream and courage have made ‘ Black Panther ’ one of the most significant film to be released in the last decade , ” said Kennedy , who noted that the critically acclaimed superhero movie ha grossed well over a billion dollar , smashing preconceived notion of how a black-led blockbuster could be received across the world .
 “ Ryan , you are a good man with a good heart , ” Kennedy said , quoting from the film . “ And it ’ s hard for a good man to be a king . ”
 Several foot away , Coogler ’ s wife , Zinzi , and the Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige beamed with pride . Coogler , on the other hand , looked like he wanted to sink through the floor .
 A few day later , when I met Coogler for coffee , he burst out laughing at the memory of his modesty . “ It ’ s easier to listen to compliment about somebody else , ” he said . Indeed , Michael B. Jordan told me that he and his “ Black Panther ” co-star Lupita Nyong ’ o take constant delight in praising Coogler to his face , “ just to make him squirm . ”
 Other director might bask in accolade , but Coogler , a high school football star who switched vocation in college to pursue a film career , ha never quite shaken the humility drilled into him by sport . “ It ’ s so rare to get compliment from your coach , ” he said . “ You ’ re kind of trained to not hear that , and even on a touchdown , you want to hear your coach say , ‘ You should have stuck your foot down earlier than you did . ’ ”
 When it come to award season , Coogler is of two mind on the subject . “ You don ’ t ever want to get too comfortable sitting in room and listening to people telling you how great the work is , ” he said . At the same time , Coogler is aware that if “ Black Panther ” score major Oscar nomination , it could open the door for more director of color . To what extent should he play the game ?
 Coogler ’ s friend , the director Ava DuVernay , said , “ Many of u are conflicted about what award season is and what it mean , even more so when we tell story of a certain kind , and when we ’ re filmmaker of a certain kind. ” Only a handful of black director have been nominated for an Academy Award , and never more than one in the same year .
 This season , another prominent contender is the “ BlacKkKlansman ” director Spike Lee , an idol of Coogler ’ s with whom he could make Oscar history . Still , the fact that Lee ha never before been nominated for a best director Oscar say plenty about why Coogler is justifiably wary of award season and why , it ’ s rumored , he turned down the invitation to become an academy member himself . ( When asked about it , he wouldn ’ t say . )
 Just a few year ago , Coogler and Jordan earned Oscar buzz for their “ Rocky ” revival “ Creed , ” yet the only person nominated from the film wa Sylvester Stallone , one of 20 all-white acting nominee in 2016 , the second consecutive year of # OscarsSoWhite . Decision maker at the academy have taken great pain since then to diversify membership , but will they come around on Coogler ?
 Despite the fact that he ha made a landmark film , organization like the Golden Globes and the Directors Guild of America have so far excluded the “ Black Panther ” director from their final five . True to form , Coogler is le concerned with his own chance and would rather take advantage of this award season to tout the contribution of his crew , many of whom would also make history if they find favor with Oscar .
 “ I ’ m not a painter or a novelist — I work in an art form where I have a lot of help , ” Coogler said . “ I ’ ve got hundred of people helping bring this film to life , and a lot of people on the street don ’ t know that . ”

 MOST SUPERHERO MOVIES only have one significant role for a woman , and that is another mold that “ Black Panther ” is happy to break : Though the film ’ s lead is T ’ Challa ( Chadwick Boseman ) , the young king of Wakanda seek the counsel of many wise woman around him , providing Nyong ’ o , Danai Gurira , Letitia Wright and Angela Bassett with prominent part .
 Coogler , too , like to surround himself with accomplished woman , and the crew of “ Black Panther ” is unusual among blockbuster for it large number of female department head . They include the director of photography Rachel Morrison and production designer Hannah Beachler , who both worked on Coogler ’ s first feature , “ Fruitvale Station , ” a well a Ruth E. Carter , the veteran costume designer responsible for Wakanda ’ s striking look .
 “ We liked to joke that we were his Dora Milaje , ” said Morrison , referring to T ’ Challa ’ s female bodyguard . “ Me and Hannah would probably both take a bullet for him . ”
 The 40-year-old Morrison , who became the first woman ever nominated for a cinematography Oscar last year , for “ Mudbound , ” is also the first female director of photography to work on a Marvel Studios film . Beachler , 48 , wa the first woman to work a a production designer for the superhero studio .
 “ I loved looking around every day at all these woman in position we ’ ve worked so hard to get to , ” Beachler said . “ Because of that , we worked extra hard for Ryan and for the opportunity we ’ d been given , but we can do this . We are professional alongside our male counterpart . ”
 The 58-year-old Carter ha been working a a costume designer since Spike Lee ’ s 1988 film , “ School Daze , ” yet the many female department head of “ Black Panther ” felt to her like the start of something new .
 “ We cut past any of the normal bureaucracy of male dominance , where they may want to overtake the conversation or need to be leader of the idea , ” Carter said , praising Coogler ’ s willingness to listen to woman . “ You don ’ t have to be overbearing to get your point to him — he ’ s open in that way . With that calmness and humility , the gate open : ‘ Hello , I have this to offer . ’ ”
 Coogler is quick to duck credit for employing so many woman in major role . “ In each one of the circumstance where I ’ ve worked with these incredible filmmaker that happen to be woman , they were the best people for the job , ” he said . Then why is it so hard for other director to follow suit ? “ I don ’ t know that I get it myself , ” Coogler said . “ If you aren ’ t opening up to find people who are truly the best , then that can limit you . ”
 While the rest of Hollywood try to make it film set look more like the real world by employing inclusion rider , Coogler ha simply hired diverse crew and cast all along . With collaborator like Morrison and Beachler , a well a actor like Jordan , Coogler see what they have to offer and make the industry see , too . “ But if you think that ’ s easy , you don ’ t know anything about Hollywood , ” DuVernay said .
 She noted that even before “ Black Panther , ” Coogler wa using “ Fruitvale Station ” and “ Creed ” to center black men who are not periphery player but hero , lover , father and son — a rarity in this industry . “ He ha this effortless thing about him , ” said DuVernay , “ this breezy quality that make people feel comfortable even though he ’ s pushing the envelope inside a system that doe not make it easy to tell those kind of story . ”
 Carter ha another way of describing the director . “ He come from Oakland , he wear his high fade with locs on the top , and he play football so he ha an athletic build , but he is a gentle spirit , ” she said . “ And a gentle soul is not something we ’ re accustomed to celebrating in black men . ”

 THERE ARE ALL sort of way to make a movie . Many director are notorious screamer , and even some of the most respected auteur in Hollywood direct defensively , a though the other people on set might water down their vision instead of contributing to it .
 Coogler go about thing differently . “ My experience is that most director who lead with ego are not so secretly very insecure or self-conscious , ” Morrison said . “ Ryan ’ s comfortable in his own skin and confident in who he is , and that allows him to turn to his D.P . and ask what she think of the script , or ask the writer what he think of the cinematography . ”
 “ For Ryan , it ’ s important to have a lot of different perspective around the table , not just his , ” said Beachler . She recalled a moment on “ Black Panther ” when a line gave her pause and Coogler suspended shooting the scene to discus her concern . “ He took the time to make sure I felt good about it , and safe , ” Beachler said . “ And that doe not happen on other set . ”
 For Coogler , this approach is common sense . “ The more angle you have when you ’ re making something , the more it help the film cut through , in my opinion , ” Coogler told me . “ I think that ’ s why this is made for the audience , at the end of the day : Film is a collective experience . ”
 It ’ s been that way for Coogler ever since he grew up in the Bay Area , when his parent would throw movie-marathon house party for him , his two brother , and their cousin . “ I wa watching high-quality stuff at an early age , ” Coogler said , crediting his mother , Joselyn , for helping him become a cinephile . “ We used to joke and call her IMDb , because before IMDb even came out , she used to say , ‘ You see that actress there in the back corner ? She played this person in that TV show . ’ ”
 When Coogler speaks about the crucial people who have helped him develop a a filmmaker , many of them are woman , including his wife , Zinzi , who weighs in on casting decision , and a college teacher , Rosemary Graham , who encouraged Coogler to take up screenwriting and still read many of his draft . According to Jordan , his longtime friend and muse , giving female perspective priority is a throughline that began in Coogler ’ s childhood and extends throughout his work .
 “ The strongest warrior in Wakanda are the woman , and the smartest , ” Jordan noted , likening that lineage to the matriarchy found in many African-American community . “ That ’ s how it is in our household and our culture , and that ’ s what our family dynamic is made out of . ”
 Even today , Coogler continues to live in the Bay Area near his parent . “ I ’ m thankful to have a big family that ’ s still honest with me , ” he said , noting that “ Black Panther ” pivot on the conflict between T ’ Challa and Jordan ’ s orphaned Killmonger , both of whom he can sympathize with . “ The fundamental difference between those two character , ” Coogler said , “ is that one grew up with a community that loved him and nurtured him , and the other had the opposite . ”
 Having been so nurtured , perhaps it ’ s no surprise that Coogler want to pay it forward . In 2007 , Coogler , about to begin film school at the University of Southern California , told the East Bay Times about what he hoped to achieve in Hollywood . Instead of settling down in Los Angeles someday , his goal wa to bring the film industry back to the impoverished part of Richmond and Oakland , where he grew up .
 “ It will be something the people can point to and kid can see it , saying , ‘ I can do that , ’ ” the young Coogler said then .
 As my coffee with Coogler concluded , I pulled the article up on my phone and noted that at the end of “ Black Panther , ” this is exactly what T ’ Challa doe . After grappling with the Oakland-born Killmonger and coming to understand the crucible he wa forged in , the young king fly to his defeated enemy ’ s home city , where he start a high-tech outreach center that will inspire the community . By making “ Black Panther , ” then , Coogler ha moved through T ’ Challa to realize a long-held goal .
 As I told him that , Coogler blinked . “ That ’ s a lot , ” he said , having never considered the connection . “ That ’ s a lot . ”
 And then he let out a laugh . It wa a laugh I ’ d heard Coogler deploy every time he wa paid a compliment , a laugh he us when he doesn ’ t know how else to react . And then , after letting himself take in the idea for just a moment , Coogler moved on .
 “ Hopefully , there ’ s more to do , ” he said .
 An earlier version of this article misstated the age of the production designer Hannah Beachler . She is 48 , not 51 .

 White House Memo
 By Mark Landler
 On a day when a fresh snowfall blanketed the White House , there wa something apt about President Trump cozying up by a fireplace with a leader of a picturesque Alpine country .
 But Mr. Trump ’ s Oval Office meeting on Wednesday with the leader , Chancellor Sebastian Kurz of Austria , had le to do with sleigh ride and hot chocolate than with their shared appeal to nationalism and determination to crack down on immigration .
 Mr. Kurz vaulted to power in Austria in late 2017 with an anti-immigration message that challenged Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany , after her country took in thousand of refugee who streamed across southern Europe from Syria and other war-torn Middle Eastern nation .
 At 32 , Mr. Kurz is the youngest leader of a government in the world . He is serving in a coalition with Austria ’ s far-right Freedom Party — a turn of event that alarm liberal in Europe but ha made him extremely attractive to Mr. Trump and his aide .
 He is a “ rock star , ” said Richard A. Grenell , the United States ambassador to Germany , who invited Mr. Kurz to lunch in Berlin . He is “ one of the rising star in the sovereignty movement , ” said Stephen K. Bannon , Mr. Trump ’ s former chief strategist , who ha tried to build a front of populist leader across Europe .
 On Wednesday , Mr. Trump granted Mr. Kurz a one-on-one meeting and an expanded session with his senior aide — the kind of attention that leader of smaller country almost never get , save for the prime minister of Ireland around St. Patrick ’ s Day .
 As Mr. Trump and Mr. Kurz sat in front of the fireplace , the president mostly marveled at Mr. Kurz ’ s age — the chancellor is five year younger than Mr. Trump ’ s son-in-law and senior adviser , Jared Kushner .
 “ He ’ s a very young leader , I have to tell you , ” Mr. Trump said , turning to his guest . “ You are a young guy ; that ’ s pretty good . ”
 Leaning forward in his chair , Mr. Kurz interjected , “ But the problem with the age is getting better from day to day . ”
 “ Someday you won ’ t be saying that , ” the president said , in what for him wa a grandfatherly tone .
 Mr. Trump and Mr. Kurz later discussed trade tension between the United States and Europe , a the White House nears a decision to impose tariff on German automobile . Austria is a producer of car part , and Mr. Kurz ha proposed himself a an intermediary between Mr. Trump and Ms. Merkel , whose relationship — never warm — ha hardened .
 “ The conversation wa tough , ” said Martin Engelberg , a senior aide to Mr. Kurz , who noted that Mr. Trump also pressed his guest on Austria ’ s reliance on natural gas from Russia . Mr. Engelberg said the two leader did not discus immigration , and he rejected the suggestion that cultivating Mr. Kurz wa a way for Mr. Trump to divide the European Union . “ The chancellor is absolutely a committed European , ” he said .
 As the leader of a country with fewer than nine million people , however , Mr. Kurz can do little to head off a trans-Atlantic trade war . Mr. Trump ’ s decision to meet with him wa mostly about what Mr. Kurz symbolizes in a Europe with which the president ha had an increasingly antagonistic relationship .
 “ For better or for worse , he is the chancellor of a German-speaking country that is in a coalition with the hard right , ” said Constanze Stelzenmüller , an expert on Europe at the Brookings Institution . “ They might see Kurz a a normalizer of the right . ”
 Shortly after he arrived in Germany , Mr. Grenell enraged his host by telling Breitbart News that he wanted to encourage a new generation of conservative leader in Europe — an obvious dig at Ms. Merkel . He singled out Mr. Kurz , a native of Vienna who rose up in the center-right People ’ s Party before seizing on the issue of Muslim immigration to carve out a sharper identity and appeal to nativist sentiment .
 “ He wa swept up in the wake of the migration crisis , ” said Eugen Freund , a member of the European Parliament from Austria . “ If there hadn ’ t been a migrant crisis , there wouldn ’ t have been a Sebastian Kurz . ”
 Mr. Freund , a former broadcaster who is a Social Democrat , said there were important difference between Mr. Kurz and Mr. Trump , aside from their age . The president is freewheeling and blunt ; the chancellor chooses his word carefully . The president vilifies the news medium ; the chancellor ha cultivated journalist in Austria , earning positive coverage .
 “ He is more like Bill Clinton than Trump , ” Mr. Freund said .
 Mr. Kurz is not the first young European leader to beguile Mr. Trump . He befriended President Emmanuel Macron of France before their relationship soured on trade and climate change , among other issue . Nor is Mr. Kurz the only nationalist to get the president ’ s attention .
 Mr. Trump ha cultivated other European populist , including Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy . And the United States recently held a summit meeting on the Middle East in Warsaw — a reward for Poland ’ s right-wing government , which ha sought close tie to Mr. Trump .
 But expert said there wa little evidence that these effort have helped the United States achieve tangible policy goal , and they have only deepened the rift with ally like Germany and France .
 “ That policy of embrace ha failed utterly , ” Ms. Stelzenmüller said . “ The Warsaw summit showed in brutal clarity the internal contradiction of U.S. policy towards the right in Europe . It showed that this policy undercut American interest and credibility . ”

 The only reaction I had ever had to pizza wa “ I want to eat you right now ! ” But last November , for the first time in my life , my stomach turned at the thought of eating a slice . The preceding two year of nonstop travel , event , special dinner and meal on the go had taken their toll on my body . The day I had been dreading had arrived : It wa time for an elimination diet .
 Because I ’ d already planned to take a monthlong solitary sabbatical in the high desert , I figured I ’ d do a cleanse then to give my digestive system a break . All I really wanted wa to get healthy enough to be able to gleefully eat pizza again . Alone in the desert , I wouldn ’ t have to face the temptation that restaurant and social gathering might pose . So with signature obsessiveness , I researched clean for week before settling upon one approved by none other than Our Lady of Wellness herself , Gwyneth Paltrow . And even though the diet seemed to eliminate pretty much everything , I found myself looking uncharacteristically forward to three week of monastic dietary rigor . The cleanse prescribed nutritional shake for breakfast and dinner , but I knew the biggest challenge would be eating only a single solid dairy- , gluten- and sugar-free meal — lunch — each day .
 Like a chump , I paid an absurd amount of money for 42 packet of shake powder and 63 packet of supplement to last the duration of the diet . And truthfully , I wa pretty optimistic about the whole thing — vividly imagining my new future a a vegan with a high-fiber diet and a gut full of good bacteria — until I tasted my first shake . Spiked with Stevia , it wa intolerably sweet . I sighed . It wa going to be a long three week .
 That evening , a my stomach began to growl , the sunset beckoned me outside . The desert gloaming wa a marvel . Every inch of sky glowed in shade of neon pink and orange , interrupted only by the outline of the occasional Joshua tree in the distance . The brilliant light wa a stark contrast to the bone-chilling January air . Shivering , I headed inside , looking forward to dinner . Then I remembered the frozen , too-sweet shake on the menu .
 Each day , I began to dread that sunset spectacle , awesome a it wa , because it signaled the arrival of yet another disappointing meal substitute . I suffered through a few nightly shake before I realized I wasn ’ t going to survive the cleanse without a hot , savory dinner . I figured I could veer from the tyranny of the shake a long a I adhered to the constraint dictated by the cleanse . I ’ d stocked the freezer with pint of homemade chicken stock , so on my first night of mild disobedience I defrosted one , seasoned it with salt and drank it gleefully , feeling it warm me from within . Emboldened , the next night I added a handful of the baby spinach I ’ d bought to add to my shake , along with some cilantro and a squeeze of lemon . That ’ s better , I thought , a I sipped the vivid green soup directly from the bowl , pleased with the brightness of the lemon and the freshness of the herb . And yet I still wished it were a little creamier .
 As a professional cook , I ’ d learned that you should always start a puréed soup with onion cooked in butter or olive oil before adding chopped vegetable to the pot and letting them soften . Then , liquid — sometimes water , sometimes stock , milk or coconut milk — is added , and everything simmer . A little cream , bread or flour or even a potato to lend some body to the soup . Finally , after puréeing , the soup is strained through a fine sieve and the seasoning are adjusted . Ever the obedient student , I ’ ve made puréed soup like this for nearly 20 year .
 But the rule of the cleanse turned everything I ’ d learned about classical cooking upside down . Without potato , flour , other starch or dairy to lean on , I had to look elsewhere to thicken and enrich the soup . In the desert I didn ’ t have access to the perfect produce available in the Bay Area , but I easily found frozen fruit and vegetable , boxed baby spinach and lettuce , fresh herb and chicken for stock at the local grocery store . Now I let the short list of food I could eat determine the bound of my creativity . With each passing evening , I began to look increasingly forward to my soup , trying all sort of different combination of vegetable , herb and stock . But I kept returning to that spinach soup loaded with cilantro and lemon . There wa something satisfying about it , even if it wa a little thin .
 One night , looking through the pantry , I spotted some tahini I ’ d brought from home and wondered what a spoonful or two might do for my spinach soup . I ’ ve always loved the combination of spinach and sesame — one of my favorite Japanese dish is blanched spinach dressed with goma-ae , a toasted sesame sauce . And when cooking for vegan friend , I often rely on the creaminess that tahini dressing lends to salad and roasted , caramelized vegetable . Could it do the same for my soup ? I stirred some into the pot , and I watched with a smile a the tahini dissolved into the broth , and then , a it always doe , began to tighten the liquid .
 I puréed the soup and tasted a rich , verdurous spoonful , humming with pleasure at the way it coated my tongue . Would a little more tahini , in another form , improve the dish ? I made a simple sauce with garlic , cumin and chile and drizzled it on top . There . I finally found what I wa looking for : a soup that tasted vegetal yet rich , tangy yet creamy , spiced to just the right point . It might have been created to adhere to an elimination diet , but abundance wa all I tasted .
 The true test of deliciousness , though , came once the cleanse wa over . I still crave this soup once a week — almost a often a pizza .

 Middle East Memo
 By Katie Rogers
 WARSAW — It wa supposed to be a summit meeting of historical adversary that gathered to unite against a common foe , Iran . But any expectation that nation with deep-rooted conflict of their own would display a newfound amity seemed troubled from the start .
 For a number of Trump administration official , including Mike Pence , a vice president who ha gained much of his foreign policy experience on the job , solving the problem seemed to be a simple a sharing a meal .
 “ I believe we are beginning a new era , ” Mr. Pence said Wednesday night at a dinner in the Polish capital , Warsaw . It wa part of a summit meeting organized by the Trump administration that drew together official from Middle Eastern country — including Israel , Saudi Arabia , Qatar and Yemen — that are known for being on opposing , not cooperating , side .
 The vice president said he looked forward to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and the foreign minister of Bahrain , Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates “ all breaking bread together and , later in this conference , sharing honest perspective on the challenge facing the region . ”
 Such camaraderie , while heavily encouraged by the visiting Americans , did not always show itself in public .
 This wa clear from a string of pained interaction — or lack of interaction — that began when a Saudi diplomat positioned himself about a far from Mr. Netanyahu a possible during a photograph session of the participant . Israel and Saudi Arabia have long collaborated on intelligence sharing in private — if not in public display of friendship .
 Things did not improve during a working lunch later in the day , when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wa mistakenly referred to a the vice president of the United States . This happened minute before the actual vice president attacked three of America ’ s closest ally , Britain , France and Germany , a dozen of dignitary tucked into their lunch of cod loin .
 And that wa just what played out in public .
 At a private meeting on Thursday , Jared Kushner , the president ’ s son-in-law and the senior adviser overseeing the administration ’ s still-undisclosed Middle East peace plan , sat at a table with Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Pompeo , according to people present .
 At the other end of the room sat a cluster of official from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates , country that have their own regional problem . That includes a blockade of Qatar by a Saudi-led coalition that accuses the Qataris of abetting terrorist activity .
 A Qatari official wa also seated at their table .
 Facing Mr. Netanyahu during that meeting , those official tried to contain themselves to cursory nod when they happened to agree with something . Officials have been painfully aware of the potential of their interaction to leak , though part of the discussion did anyway .
 Aside from Israel , most nation sent foreign minister or other emissary rather than head of state . The White House ha not released the name and title of all those who attended , and it did not immediately respond to a request on Thursday to supply that information .
 In any event , White House official have marveled over the willingness of adversary to sit in the same room together , hailing the fact that anyone from the region showed up a a historic accomplishment .
 One person who observed the meeting described the mood inside a “ let ’ s give it a chance ” — not exactly the optimistic tone Mr. Pence struck at the pre-summit dinner .
 The diplomatic calculation that Mr. Pence made throughout the event — and not always to great success — seemed to play out in real time a he weighed the benefit and cost of working with such an uneasy set of ally .
 This showed itself during Mr. Pence ’ s speech on Thursday , when he launched into a point-by-point castigation of Iran , pausing briefly to chew out Germany , Britain and France .
 The three nation had “ led the effort to create mechanism to break up our sanction ” on Iran , Mr. Pence said , before adding that the “ time ha come for our European partner to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal . ”
 The extraordinary assertion — quite awkward , too , given the European attendee — may have been an attempt at the spontaneity now closely associated with the Trump administration ’ s art-of-the-deal approach . Mr. Pence ’ s prepared remark , which circulated just before the speech , did not contain the explicit demand for ally to withdraw from the 2015 accord .
 The nuance-free calculation also showed up in comment the vice president made about the October killing of Jamal Khashoggi , the Saudi dissident strangled last fall in the Saudi Consulate in Turkey .
 In his lunchtime remark , Mr. Pence forcefully defended the role of a free and independent press , saying that the administration continues to “ demand that all those responsible for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi be brought to justice . ”
 Hours later , asked by a reporter about the Trump administration ’ s stance on who wa ultimately responsible for the killing , Mr. Pence defended Saudi Arabia a an ally .
 The country , he said “ play an important role in the new alignment that you see developing across the Arab world , including with Israel , in confronting and containing and bringing economic and diplomatic pressure on Iran . ”
 With the Trump administration ’ s first major diplomatic event under his belt , Mr. Pence prepared on Thursday evening to depart for Germany , where he wa scheduled to speak at the more established Munich Security Conference .
 In an annual report , the conference organizer have pointed out that a key source of anxiety among America ’ s traditional ally wa the forceful , at time erratic way in which the administration asserts itself on the world stage .

 My extremely fun job ( really ! ) combine three of my greatest love : cleaning , voyeurism and problem-solving .
 By Jolie Kerr
 Times Insider explains who we are and what we do , and delivers behind-the-scenes insight into how our journalism come together .
 The New York Times is full of dream job : Pete Wells get paid to eat at restaurant ; Sebastian Modak is about to travel around the world ; Will Shortz is living his eighth-grade dream of making a career out of puzzle . But my job is the most fun of all .
 I am The Times ’ s go-to cleaning contributor . ( Yes , one exists ! ) Most people , when they hear the word “ cleaning , ” do not immediately think of fun , but , truly , those people are missing out . I do all manner of work related to cleaning : big , broad-scope guide on how to clean your entire home ; narrow , niche article about thing like caring for Halloween costume ( you ’ ll want to get another use out of that Sexy Gritty ensemble , naturally ) ; and reported feature in which I get to the bottom of why all vintage clothing store smell like , well , vintage clothing store .
 You will , of course , want to know how I got this way and what , exactly , qualifies me to do this work . Well , I know an awful lot about cleaning , and I ’ ve been writing about it for almost eight year for publication including Esquire and Jezebel . I ’ ve been working with The Times since 2017 . But more important , there ’ s a combination of empathy , humor and a desire to solve problem that make me especially suited for this job . I ’ m a fixer . A family member once said , awed after I ’ d intervened in a Thanksgiving cooking disaster in the making , “ Jolie , you ’ re like the Wolf from ‘ Pulp Fiction. ’ ” It ’ s the greatest compliment I ’ ve ever received .
 You might be surprised to learn that , like “ Pulp Fiction , ” being a cleaning expert is hilariously profane . ( Here come the part where you begin to understand , or understand not at all , based on how much you enjoy a dirty joke , why I ’ m so certain I have the most fun job at The New York Times . ) Your life are quite often booze- and sex-soaked ; even more often , because of toddler and college student and pet , they are pee-soaked . And you write to me about these problem ! I find it endlessly fascinating and amusing and also quite touching to be trusted with your messy life .
 In your hand , even the most mundane of household furniture , the humble couch , can be fodder for hilarity , a one reader recently demonstrated . His email opened chirpily enough , “ Hi Jolie ! ” Then , a turn toward the dark : “ I ’ m currently stuck to my couch , so I figure it ’ s time to solve this mess . ”
 As it turn out , the joy in reading about cleaning isn ’ t really in the solution themselves , though they can be funny . ( Using a paste made of meat tenderizer — the unseasoned stuff , please ! — for removing set-in blood stain from mattress ? True story ! ) Rather , it ’ s in marveling at the marvelous mess people have made for and of themselves . And so , you read . ( Or listen , if you ’ re a podcast enthusiast . I have one of those ! It ’ s called “ Ask a Clean Person . ” )
 Here ’ s the downside to my job : I can not be all thing to all people . This hurt me in the tenderest part of my tender heart , because , truly , the joy of the job — other than the joy that come along with the voyeurism of learning how , exactly , you fused your rear end to the sofa — is helping people . But I can know only a much a you tell me ; absent the richness of a full life ’ s context , my advice will always be imperfect . I do , however , endeavor to provide solution and option that fit three sometimes opposing criterion : the best solution to a problem ; a budget-friendly approach to cleaning and caring for your belonging ; and an eco-friendly and/or nontoxic option , because that matter to a great many people .
 But those burden are mine , and mine alone , and a we ’ ve established , your burden are much more interesting . So let ’ s return to the matter of the viscous couch . The problem , you see , wa that it owner , in a misguided attempt to restore it good look , had doused the cushion in leather conditioner , and then placed them on his roof to bake in the sun . He essentially seasoned it like a cast iron skillet ! The solution , then , wa to head to the kitchen for a Dobie Pad with which to scour the stickiness away — a trick I learned about from spending , oh , a few thousand hour watching car detailing video on YouTube and can now pas onto you . But should you find yourself stumped in the face of a cleaning conundrum , don ’ t fret ! Just write to me .

 It doesn ’ t seem likely that Netflix and DC Universe , competitor in the field of subscription streaming video , get together to plan their schedule . So chalk it up to coincidence that Netflix is releasing “ The Umbrella Academy ” on the same day ( Friday ) that DC Universe is releasing “ Doom Patrol , ” while you note that the “ Doom Patrol ” comic book were a primary model , along with “ X-Men , ” for the “ Umbrella Academy ” comic .
 Or chalk it up to our apparently bottomless appetite for superhero team , which television happily feed : The new series join DC Comics title like “ Legends of Tomorrow , ” “ Titans ” and “ Black Lightning ” and Marvel show like “ Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. , ” “ Runaways , ” “ The Gifted ” and “ Legion , ” to name a few . On the horizon are a couple of heavyweight , HBO ’ s “ Watchmen ” adaptation and Netflix ’ s “ Jupiter ’ s Legacy . ”
 So what do these two handsomely produced new show add to the conversation ? Continuing proof that comic book and TV show have very different vocabulary , and that converting the first into the second requires hard choice . The most enjoyable adaptation commit to traditional TV value ( “ Black Lightning ” on CW ) or go all in on replicating the comic book experience ( “ Legion ” on FX ) . Shows that fall in between often exhibit a particular variety of lifelessness — they ’ re action thriller in which the action feel forced and they ’ re family drama in which we don ’ t really care about the family .
 Which brings u to “ The Umbrella Academy , ” based on the comic series created by Gerard Way ( the multitalented artist who wa also lead vocalist of My Chemical Romance ) and Gabriel Bá . Like “ Doom Patrol , ” which Way ha generously cited a an influence , it ’ s about a superpowered band of outsider assembled by a possibly mad , definitely abrasive genius who double a father figure .
 And , in this case , a actual father : Reginald Hargreeves ( Colm Feore ) adopts the seven future member of the Umbrella Academy team a baby , shortly after they ’ re all born on the same day to mother who didn ’ t appear to be pregnant . Frequent flashback show them being harshly raised and trained in a dark , many-chambered mansion , giving the show some Harry Potter schoolboy flavor . That motif is emphasized by the prominence in the story of Number Five ( Aidan Gallagher ) , who return from the future trapped in his 13-year-old body ( though he ’ s aged several decade beyond his 20-something foster sibling ) and spends the 10-episode season dressed in his hunter-green , short-pants school uniform .
 The show ’ s primary mode , however — a the estranged team member reunite for their father ’ s funeral and find themselves under attack by mysterious assassin , one played by Mary J. Blige — could be called “ Legion ” lite . ( The show ’ s creator , Steve Blackman , wa an executive producer on that FX series . )
 It take stab at hallucinatory , Gregory Crewdson-like visual setup , and it go for a hybrid futuro-retro production design — the killer receive their order in pneumatic tube that pop up wherever they happen to be . The soundtrack , ranging from They Might Be Giants to the Hollies to Nina Simone , feel annoyingly self-conscious .
 [ Plan ahead for the month to come with our culture calendar . ]
 Its attempt to capture the visual and narrative virtuosity of the comic are halfhearted , though , and we ’ re left with a polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story : saving the world a a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentment and family dysfunction ; teenage alienation a an apocalyptic force that ha to be brought under control . The first episode introduces the stock character ( loyal son , too-perfect daughter , rebel , cynic , screw-up ) in lively fashion , but then the story bog down in anemic mystery and filler , like a risible detour into the Vietnam War .
 It ’ s easy enough to watch , at least until the requisite season-ending big battle , a pale echo of “ Carrie. ” And there are performance that keep you interested , including Kate Walsh a a kind of time lord , Cameron Britton a a philosophical hit man and especially the 15-year-old Gallagher ( of Nickelodeon ’ s “ Nicky , Ricky , Dicky & Dawn , ” ) , who ’ s remarkably assured a a hard-bitten 58-year-old in a middle-schooler ’ s body . He carry the show a far a he can .
 The news about “ Doom Patrol ” is provisionally better , though much le definitive , since only two episode were available . Selectively drawn from the long-running DC series and adapted for TV by Jeremy Carver ( “ Supernatural ” ) , it ’ s about an older group of misfit than those in “ Umbrella Academy , ” and it work in a satirical , high-concept mode rather than teenage melodrama .
 The dilapidated hero present for the show ’ s inception include the self-explanatory Robotman and the bandage-swathed Negative Man , voiced by Brendan Fraser and Matt Bomer , along with Elasti-Woman ( April Bowlby ) , whose power and curse is an extreme form of elephantiasis , and Crazy Jane ( Diane Guerrero ) , with a many power a personality . They have their own mansion , in the rural Midwest , where they ’ re overseen by their own eccentric genius ( Timothy Dalton ) .
 “ Doom Patrol ” operates inside big quotation mark , with Alan Tudyk ( who play the villain Mr. Nobody ) providing an arch , self-referential narrative in which he anticipates critic ’ reaction to the show and intones , “ Let the pretentious title sequence begin . ”
 Dressing up the standard superteam trope with this kind of metafictional framework could get old fast . But a show that give you a donkey who spell out message in big green cloud of flatulence get at least one more week from me .

 “ Game of Thrones ” star past and present filled Radio City Music Hall earlier this month for the world premiere of the first episode of the fantasy saga ’ s eighth and final season , which debut Sunday on HBO . But in their speech before the screening , the creator David Benioff and D.B . Weiss gave some of their deepest thanks to someone who most of the crowd probably wouldn ’ t recognize .
 “ We only made it this far because of Bernadette Caulfield , the greatest producer alive , ” Benioff said .
 [ Read our complete guide to “ Game of Thrones ” and sign up for our newsletter . ]
 Caulfield , an executive producer for the show , isn ’ t a familiar to fan a Benioff or Weiss or actor like Emilia Clarke ( who play the dragon queen Daenerys Targaryen ) , Sophie Turner ( Sansa Stark ) and Lena Headey ( Cersei Lannister ) . But for those people , she is the real star of “ Game of Thrones . ”
 “ She ’ s the beating heart of our show , ” Clarke said .
 “ The woman that I want to grow up to be like , ” Turner said .
 “ The true Mother of Dragons , ” Headey said .
 “ The single best thing that ever happened to the show , ” Benioff and Weiss wrote in a joint email .
 Even a writer and showrunners have become celebrated in this age of intensely dissected series , television is still made mostly by the unsung — all those name in the credit that turn the script into actual television .
 This is especially true for “ Game of Thrones. ” With it sprawling tale unfolding in a wide variety of environment , it wa almost certainly the most technically complicated series ever made , at time running five unit ( film crew ) simultaneously , on multiple continent , to complete a given season on time .
 And they rarely shot simple scene — “ Game of Thrones ” became a sensation partly through gobsmacking sequence involving elaborate battle , people on fire and the occasional bear . It inhabited cliff , crypt and cave in Northern Ireland . It closed city street in Spain and Croatia to film riot , insurgency and a nude walk of shame . It took a crew into an Icelandic blizzard to capture the world beyond the Wall .
 [ Less blabbing , more stabbing : Read how spectacle won “ Game of Thrones . ” ]
 Whatever your feeling about the show itself , it is inarguably a marvel of scale and execution . ( Over eight season , it used nearly 13,000 extra in Northern Ireland alone . ) And if you ask nearly anyone associated with it who the linchpin holding the entire thing together wa the answer is “ Bernie . ”
 “ Without her , the whole thing would have collapsed under it own weight long ago , ” Benioff and Weiss said .
 “ Well , I wish I wa that important , ” Caulfield said when I reached her in England , where she ’ s working on Joss Whedon ’ s new series , “ The Nevers , ” for HBO . “ But obviously it take a major team to put it together . ”
 That team included her “ wingman , ” the producer Chris Newman , and the show ’ s production designer , Deborah Riley , among many , many others . But Caulfield wa the person in charge of everything , the creator said , overseeing all aspect of the production , from the enormously complex logistical planning to the budget and production schedule to the “ health and happiness of the crew . ”
 For Caulfield , however , the task wa relatively straightforward . “ My job is to make whatever they write on the page come to the screen , ” she said .
 Caulfield grew up in upstate New York and went to high school in Rochester , where she also worked in local theater . When a movie filmed in the area in 1981 , she signed on a a production assistant and wa bitten by the show-business bug — she moved to Los Angeles within a year . As she rose through the industry rank , she worked with some of the most esteemed producer in Hollywood , including Steven Bochco ( on “ Brooklyn South ” and “ Philly ” ) , Michael Mann ( “ Robbery Homicide Division ” ) and Ridley and Tony Scott ( “ The Good Wife ” ) .
 She honed her multiple-unit chop a a producer on “ The X-Files ” and then later on the HBO polygamy drama “ Big Love. ” As that show wa wrapping up in 2011 , she heard about “ sort of a fantasy , medieval piece ” the network wa shooting in Britain . She joined “ Game of Thrones ” for it second season , replacing the outgoing producer Mark Huffam .
 It ’ s easy to forget now , given the cavalcade of spectacle “ Game of Thrones ” ha become , that it wa a much quieter show in the early day . The dragon were glorified lizard and the first big combat sequence , the Battle of the Blackwater , didn ’ t come until the end of Season 2 .
 Season 3 brought sign of the expansion to come , with new world and more extreme element , like the bear that Brienne of Tarth ( Gwendoline Christie ) squared off with in one gonzo sequence .
 “ Gwendoline said , ‘ I can ’ t believe I ’ m working with a live bear here ! , ’ and David said , ‘ I know , I didn ’ t believe that Bernie would actually do this , ’ ” Caulfield recalled , laughing . “ I didn ’ t think I had any option but to do it . ”
 [ Read our “ Game of Thrones ” Season 8 preview . ]
 As the story and budget grew , from $ 5 million per episode in the early day to a much a $ 15 million in Season 8 , so did the production . If it wasn ’ t explicitly a goal for the show to top itself each season , that wa the practical result of a story that grew from a clash of clan to a transcontinental war to — this season — a battle against an undead army for the survival of humankind .
 “ She created a production that could effectively scale up from season to season without losing either it efficiency or it heart , ” Benioff and Weiss said . “ There are so many version of ‘ Game of Thrones ’ that would have fallen apart under the strain of producing 10 increasingly big hour of television on a 12-month schedule . Pretty much every version except the Bernie version . ”
 When Caulfield wasn ’ t on some far-flung set or checking out the action on any of the six stage at the show ’ s Belfast studio , she wa in the production office planning — prepping new director , new shoot , new country . “ It really wa the Game of Meetings , ” she said .
 But it wa her “ gruff love of every damn person on the show , ” Benioff and Weiss said , that made her beloved by the people she wa ordering around in often extreme condition .
 “ I know how heavy cable is ; I know what the crew ha to go through — I ’ m actually married to a dolly grip , ” she said . “ Sometimes he ’ d say , ‘ You love your crew more than me. ’ Probably at that moment I do , because I have to . ”
 The most emotionally taxing day were the one that involved lighting people on fire . Stunt coordinator will generally say fall are the most dangerous , but the shoot that stick in Caulfield ’ s memory is the scene in the fighting pit of Meereen in Season 6 , when the big dragon Drogon — on set represented by a long pole with a ball on the end — torched multiple victim . The execution of the scene involved a flamethrower on a dolly rolling past , igniting multiple stunt performer .
 “ They say they don ’ t worry and they love doing it , but I think they ’ re all crazy , ” she said .
 The maternal dynamic extended to the actor , whose growing fame led to ever more demanding schedule to juggle a the show itself became more physically strenuous . “ She literally wa the mum of the whole thing , ” Clarke said .
 “ It wa like , ‘ Listen , I know we ’ re in the middle of a field and it ’ s 3 a.m. and it ’ s the second month of night shoot and everyone ’ s exhausted and everyone ’ s screaming at you because you are the person that everyone come to for everything , but can I just talk to you about this Dothraki line I ’ ve got next week ? ’ ” she added . “ And she will . ”
 Caulfield ’ s angst antenna bordered on the uncanny , they say . Nikolaj Coster-Waldau , who play the redeemed rogue Jaime Lannister , recalled a time when a stressful personal situation had him on the brink of an on-set tantrum .
 “ Suddenly she wa next to me very gently saying , ‘ Hey are you O.K . ? ’ ” he said . “ And just the way she said that made me look at myself from the outside and see that I wa about to turn into one of those horrible actors. ” He continued , “ So I am really grateful that she stopped me from becoming a complete fool . ”
 Caulfield acknowledged that whatever considerable scheduling , weather and budgeting obstacle she overcame on “ Game of Thrones , ” her most important attribute on a production full of ice and fire and many flavor of human toil , wa her emotional intelligence . “ I do feel like I ’ m sensitive to seeing somebody who ’ s not smiling a much , ” she said .
 “ I still run into a lot of different crew , and you know , you hug them like you don ’ t want to let go , ” she said . “ A lot of people felt like it wa time to move on , but I also think if it went on another five year , everybody would have hung in there for five year . Because it meant that much to all of u . ”
 An earlier version of this article described in error the attendee at the “ Game of Thrones ” premiere . Bernadette Caulfield wa present , not absent .

 In a rundown school in Nekoosa , Wis. — population 2,500 — an old trainer try to keep the hope of small-town boxer alive .
 By James Card and Photographs by Lauren Justice
 NEKOOSA , Wis. — At an abandoned school in a paper mill town in central Wisconsin , a piece of white paper is taped to a side door . Written in black marker it read : “ RAPIDS BOXING. ” Climb a stairway to the third floor and there ’ s another handwritten sign .
 “ Restroom , ” it read . “ No resting allowed . ”
 At the end of a dark hallway , you hear the drumming of a speed bag and the squeaking of shuffling sneaker . They are interrupted every three minute by the buzz of a timer . Before entering , however , there ’ s one more sign to consider : “ First 3 Rules of Boxing . ”
 1 . Hands Up .
 2 . Hands Up .
 3 . After punching , bring your hand back fast and high .
 Then come the final bit of instruction : “ Annual Gym Fee . $ 20 . Pay Ken or Karel . ”
 Ken is Ken Hilgers , 69 , a grandfather and retired paper mill powerhouse operator who will teach the art of boxing to any child who walk through the door .
 In a time when high school boxing team are unheard-of and university boxing program have faded , this gym is home to one of the small-town club that have kept the sport alive in the Upper Midwest .
 “ They are a dying breed , ” Hilgers said of rural gym like his . “ We used to have a boxing club in every town . We used to compete every single weekend . ”
 Dale Horn , a successful boxer trained by Hilgers in the 1970s , had more than 100 amateur bout and won five state championship . In contrast , Hilgers pointed to Taylor Smith Jr. , a burly 10-year-old who wa pounding away on a heavy bag a if it had stolen his lunch money .
 “ Taylor here ha been looking for a bout for a year , ” Hilgers said . “ We haven ’ t found him an opponent of the appropriate age and weight . ”
 Taylor ha trained at the club for the past three year , one of 15 child who are here twice a week and form the core of the Wisconsin Rapids Boxing Club .
 In 1975 , when Hilgers started training at a Y.M.C.A . near here , the place had an abundance of boxer , and he had the most successful junior Olympic boxing team in Wisconsin .
 “ They were all star in their school system , and I ’ ve never had a run of athlete like that since , ” Hilgers said .
 He estimate that 1,300 boxer have been a part of his club over the year , and 30 of them became state champion . The most famous wa Steve Zouski , who went on to post a 31-18 record a a professional . He got in the ring with the former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and George Foreman .
 In 1986 , Zouski caught Tyson , then 19 and 18-0 , on his way up . Zouski wa knocked out at 2 minute 39 second of the third round at Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale , N.Y . It wa the only time he lost by knockout . The next year , he wa the first opponent Foreman , then 38 , faced after being retired for 10 year .
 Foreman ’ s age didn ’ t matter : The referee stopped the fight in his favor early in the fourth round at Arco Arena in Sacramento .
 Hilgers still marvel at how Zouski could take a punch .
 “ I knocked him down in practice once by mistake , ” he said . “ When he got up , his eye were an entirely different color . He started at the belt and worked his way up . Let me tell you , I never attempted to knock him down again . ”
 Hilgers ha taught boxing in odder place than this abandoned school .
 The club wa at a National Guard Armory for a year , and spent time in a senior center that wa eventually condemned .
 “ We worked out one winter there without any heat , ” Hilgers said of the senior center . “ We had to supply our own . What a winter ! Everybody smelled like kerosene and diesel fuel . ”
 Now , the old Nekoosa High School is it home .
 The ring at the center of the room is surrounded by a plywood ledge littered with glove and tiny dumbbell . Old headgear and boxing glove are reused a padding , duct-taped to the red , white and blue corner post . The rope , frayed and buffered with pipe insulation , are secured by more duct tape .
 Two heavy bag , three double-end bag and a slip bag hang from an A-frame structure repurposed from the paper mill . The speed bag is mounted on a wood and cast iron structure made by Medart that might be more than 100 year old .
 “ If we didn ’ t get this site , I wa going to quit , ” Hilgers confessed .
 But then two young brother , Evan and Will Stenerson , walked through his door , and he conjured dream of more title run . They were hardworking and eager to absorb Hilgers ’ s knowledge . Last year , Evan lost a close decision to a reigning state champion .
 “ The kid came up to me and said I deserved the belt , and he handed it to me , ” Evan Stenerson , 13 , said , referring to his opponent .
 Now the belt hang in the gym .
 Will Stenerson , 14 , ha a 7-2 record , and the teenager ’ younger brother , John , 9 , followed them to the gym and train here now , too .
 “ Boxing make you a lot more brave , '' Will said . “ It get your courage up . ”
 On one winter day in the gym , Hilgers nodded at the man in the ring holding punch mitt for Will Stenerson . The man , 24-year-old Nick Maher , may also be the future of the gym — a a successor to Hilgers .
 Maher wa one of the club ’ s most successful amateur and , along with his two brother , formed the backbone for Rapids ’ s multiple state , regional and national title .
 “ He ’ s obviously a really good coach , but there is a lot more to keeping everything in line here , ” Hilgers said .
 Maher is not ready for Hilgers to leave , but he share his old trainer ’ s commitment to keeping the gym alive .
 “ This is where I grew up , ” Maher said . “ If you ’ re not in Madison or Milwaukee , and you don ’ t want to go to a fitness gym and get trained like a machine , you have to go to the little town that have these gym with three or four guy in it , and those are the club that are molding boxer into national champion . ”

 WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused Cuba and Russia on Monday of propping up President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela in the Trump administration ’ s most explicit argument yet that his government is a dictatorial regime kept alive by two American adversary .
 Mr. Pompeo ’ s comment came amid a devastating power outage that ha plunged many of Venezuela ’ s most populous area into darkness , spoiling food in a nation where little is available .
 He denied Mr. Maduro ’ s accusation that foreign power — a clear reference to the United States — had any role in creating the blackout that ha brought the country to the brink of social implosion . Instead , Mr. Pompeo said , the blame lie squarely with Havana and Moscow .
 “ When there is no electricity , thank the marvel of modern Cuban-led engineering , ” Mr. Pompeo said in comment laced with sarcasm . “ When there ’ s no water , thank the excellent hydrologist from Cuba . When there ’ s no food , thank the Cuban communist overlord . ”
 He also said the Russian government had used two of it major news medium outlet , RT and Sputnik , to “ divert attention ” while converting Venezuela ’ s gold reserve into cash .
 “ The Kremlin is standing with it Venezuelan crony , ” Mr. Pompeo said , “ against the will of the people of a sovereign nation to protect a Moscow-friendly regime . ”
 The United States ha previously described Cuba and Russia a Mr. Maduro ’ s enablers , but never with the specificity Mr. Pompeo offered on Monday . His statement , made at the State Department , came a few hour after the Treasury Department imposed new sanction on a Russia-based bank that it accused of helping Mr. Maduro ’ s government circumvent earlier American financial penalty .
 The bank , Evrofinance Mosnarbank , is based in Moscow and is jointly controlled by Venezuelan and Russian state-owned company . The Treasury said the bank ’ s asset grew more than 50 percent last year , even a the United States escalated it sanction against Venezuela and a European financial institution severed tie with Caracas , the capital .
 At a moment when President Trump is beginning to accuse potential Democratic rival of embracing socialism , Mr. Pompeo , a former Kansas conservative congressman who ha lost none of his partisan edge , said socialism and cronyism were at the heart of Venezuela ’ s problem .
 “ Nicolás Maduro promised Venezuelans a better life in a socialist paradise , ” he told reporter . “ And he delivered on the socialism part , which ha proved time and time again is a recipe for economic ruin . The paradise part ? Not so much . ”
 There ha been a running debate inside the State Department and American intelligence agency over just how much to reveal about secret finding against Russia and Cuba , the latter of which Mr. Pompeo called “ the true imperialist power ” in Caracas .
 Mr. Pompeo said Caracas sends up to 50,000 barrel of oil to Cuba daily , a figure some expert question given the dysfunction in Venezuela . In turn , Mr. Pompeo said , Mr. Maduro benefit from Havana ’ s “ expertise in repression to keep his grip on power . ”
 “ It ’ s a match made in hell , ” he said . Nonetheless , he argued that support is increasing for Juan Guaidó , the previously little-known opposition legislator who is now recognized by the United States and more than 50 other nation a Venezuela ’ s legitimate leader .
 “ We wish thing could go faster , but I am very confident that the tide is moving in the direction of the Venezuelan people , ” Mr. Pompeo said .
 As he spoke , the situation in Venezuela grew more desperate . In barely operating hospital , patient begged doctor to be kept alive .
 Monday wa the fifth day since Venezuela ’ s power system went down , plunging most of the country , including Caracas , into sporadic darkness and dampening hope of imminent resolution .
 “ We ’ re going to arrive at a moment when we ’ re going to eat each other , ” said Zuly González , 40 , a resident of Caracas ’ s Chacao district .
 The blackout wa just the latest crisis to befall a country that seems to have one after another . Hyperinflation and a failing economy led million to flee before the desperation of recent day . But Venezuela ha been further torn since January , when opposition political leader refused to acknowledge Mr. Maduro ’ s re-election .
 On Thursday , the San Geronimo B substation in the center of the country , which supply electricity to four out of five Venezuelans from the massive Guri hydropower plant , went down .
 No date ha been set to restart the plant and most worker were told to stay home on Monday , said two of the substation ’ s worker and a manager at the national power monopoly , Corpoelec . Their name have been withheld to protect them from government reprisal .
 The nearby San Geronimo A backup substation , which conveys a lesser amount of power from the smaller Macagua hydropower plant , operated intermittently on Sunday . Supplies from Macagua and a few unreliable thermoelectric plant allowed the government to send sporadic power to Caracas throughout the day .
 The government said the blackout wa caused by an unspecified fault at Guri , which provides 80 percent of the country ’ s electricity . Mr. Maduro and his minister have insisted the blackout is the result of sabotage and cyberattacks organized by the United States and the opposition , without providing any evidence .
 Outside expert said there wa little evidence of a cyberattack or other external trigger to blame . And energy expert , Venezuelan power sector contractor and current and former Corpoelec employee have dismissed accusation of sabotage , saying the blackout wa the result of year of underinvestment , corruption and brain drain .
 When visited on Sunday , the substation ’ s usual buzz of high-voltage cross current had been replaced by total silence . A cow roamed amid the transformer . Several National Guard soldier and a unit of police commando were at the substation , but no employee were there .
 The substation is vital “ to supply the country in a stable way , ” said José Aguilar , a Venezuelan power industry expert based in Chicago . Its paralysis mean power is unlikely to be restored nationally until Tuesday at the earliest , he said .
 The government declared Monday a holiday for school and public worker .
 What caused the blackout ha been a source of speculation . A Corpoelec union leader , Ali Briceño , told reporter on Friday that a brush fire under a power trunk line destabilized the grid and caused Guri ’ s turbine to shut down . The government ha struggled to restart the turbine since , he said .
 Other expert said the magnitude of the blackout indicated the problem wa caused by a major failure inside Guri ’ s turbine . A Corpoelec supervisor involved in dispatching Guri ’ s power said he wa told by the plant ’ s manager on Thursday that the plant ’ s equipment wa damaged .
 After analyzing power level across the country , Mr. Aguilar , who consults reinsurance company on Venezuela ’ s power sector , said the government ha tried to restart Guri four time since the start of the blackout on Thursday .
 The latest attempt led to the explosion of a secondary substation near Guri on Saturday .
 “ Every time they attempt to restart , they fail and the disruption break something else in the system , destabilizing the grid yet further , ” Mr. Aguilar said .
 “ Obviously , they are hiding something from u , ” he said of the government .
 An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a hydropower plant . It is Macagua , not Matagua .

 Who ’ s champion of the race to the bottom ?
 By Gail Collins
 Opinion Columnist
 The vote are in , and the winner of the Worst Trump Cabinet Member competition is …
 Wilbur Ross !
 First time a secretary of commerce ha ever won the title . Don ’ t let me hear you complaining that this administration hasn ’ t accomplished anything .
 The Ross victory is a little suspect , since it came right after he gave an interview in which he expressed befuddlement about why furloughed government worker were going to food bank and homeless shelter when they could — you know , just go see their banker and take out a loan .
 Do you think he wa making a play for first place ? Nah , that wa just Wilbur being Wilbur , the guy who happily marveled that when Donald Trump visited Saudi Arabia “ there wa not a single hint of a protester anywhere. ” When reminded that the Saudi government ha a way of making protester disappear , Ross admitted “ in theory that could be true ” but quickly added , “ there wa certainly no sign of it . ”
 Until then Ross ’ s biggest claim to cabinet fame wa perhaps his habit of falling asleep at meeting . Hey , the man is 81 . Give him a break .
 Coming in a close second wa Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen , followed by that perennial favorite , Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos .
 Nielsen , who one reader called “ the queen of mendacity , ” got vote for her work separating thousand of family at the Mexican border . The Trump immigration policy were on so many people ’ s mind , they put Stephen Miller in fourth place even though he ’ s not actually in the cabinet .
 Miller , a 33-year-old senior adviser to the president , is a longtime enemy of bipartisan immigration reform who ’ s a chief architect of Trump ’ s wall-mania . So it ’ s sort of pleasant to mention , just for the heck of it , that lately Miller ’ s seemed to be trying to fight premature balding by spraying some kind of black stuff on the top of his head .
 Our voting result are not entirely scientific , given reader ’ demand to be able to vote for two , three or 12 different contender . ( “ Why not give it to them all ? My daughter played softball and everybody got a trophy . ” )
 DeVos , a former Worst Cabinet Member winner , ha faded a bit a her ineffectiveness appeared to mitigate some of her bad intention . Nevertheless , it ’ s clear our reader have been keeping an eagle eye on what she ’ s been up to , however fumbling the effort . One voter cited “ her disinterest in addressing the national student debt crisis ; her support of private institution ’ shady loan practice ; her bungling of college campus sex policy ; her complete lack of knowledge and interest in classroom achievement. ” And that wa just the first part of the letter .
 Other high-rankers in the Worst contest were Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin . Some reader mentioned Pompeo ’ s cheerful visit to Saudi Arabia that wa highlighted by “ his boys-will-be-boys willingness to overlook the savage murder of Saudi Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi . ”
 Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson got quite a few vote despite a certain lack of , um , public presence . ( “ What happened to Ben Carson ? No , seriously . What happened to him ? Did he fall asleep in a chair somewhere ? Did he ever get out of that elevator ? ” )
 Ditto Secretary of Energy Rick Perry , whose most notable recent achievement wa being the cabinet member who stayed away from the State of the Union address so he could run the country if everybody else got assassinated .
 We do not want to pursue this thought for any number of reason .
 There were virtually no vote for either the head of the Department of Interior or the Environmental Protection Agency . Ryan Zinke and Scott Pruitt were big Worst contender in the past , but they ’ re gone now , thrown into the darkness for various embarrassment along the line of super-expensive trip on the public dime and , in Pruitt ’ s case , telling an aide to inquire about purchasing an old mattress from a Trump hotel .
 Now Trump ha announced that he ’ s nominating David Bernhardt to be his new secretary of the Interior . Bernhardt is a former oil lobbyist whose biggest interest in public land appears to involve drilling on them . I ’ ll bet we hear a lot more of him next time around .
 The list go on and on . There ’ s hardly a cabinet member who doesn ’ t seem to be driving reader crazy . Some of them are losing sleep over the fact that Senator Mitch McConnell ’ s wife , Elaine Chao , is running the Department of Transportation while her family run an international shipping company . ( “ I ’ m not convinced she would win a prize — there are so many corrupt contender . But she might get a ( dis ) honorable mention. ” ) Chao is also a big fan of privatizing thing — including the Federal Aviation Administration .
 Truly , we should give a shout-out to Donald Trump for creating such a memorable bunch of top official . “ I have followed politics a very long time … and this is the first time I can actually name more than one or two cabinet people from memory , because they are so freaking dangerously bad , ” moaned one reader .
 Think about it . How many member of the Obama cabinet can you recall ? Even when George W. Bush wa hanging out with Dick Cheney , did you know who wa running the Department of Commerce ?
 At least we ’ re all paying attention .

 Aroldis Chapman wa nicknamed the Cuban Missile for a reason . The Yankees ’ lanky left-handed closer from the Caribbean island ha long been the most prominent face of the velocity explosion in modern baseball . Ever since he broke into the major league in 2010 , few pitcher could match his 100-miles-per-hour fastball .
 Until last season . A month on the injured list with left knee tendinitis sapped some power , and his average fastball speed dipped slightly from the previous season , to 98.9 m.p.h . He wa still among the hardest thrower in baseball , but for the first time since 2013 , Chapman wa not top : St. Louis Cardinals relief pitcher Jordan Hicks , nine year younger , claimed the title with a 100.5-m.p.h . average , according to Fangraphs .
 “ That ’ s no problem for me , ” Chapman , 31 , said in Spanish recently , adding later : “ I ’ m not 20 or 22 anymore . The year pile up — not by choice . ”
 So some eyebrow , including those of the injured and inconsistent Yankees , were understandably raised when Chapman began this season — albeit in the early April chill of the Northeast — throwing fastball a slow a 92 m.p.h . It wa yet another potentially worrying issue for a Yankees bullpen that ha not lived up to lofty expectation , and for the depleted roster in general .
 But Chapman himself wa not concerned — and with reason . In keeping with past early-season buildup , his speed ha ticked up each outing , reaching 98 to 100 m.p.h . with ease in his two most recent appearance . In the admittedly small sample size of seven game , his average wa back up to 97.1 m.p.h . entering Friday night ’ s 6-2 win over the Kansas City Royals .
 “ As I get more work , I feel much better and my arm ’ s better , too , a well a my velocity and my pitch , ” said Chapman . “ Little by little . A lot of people worry about velocity , but I ’ m not worried about it . ”
 But a his average pick up with the temperature and inning , where will it ultimately settle ?
 Chapman , a five-time All-Star , is still an outlier given how long he ha held his velocity . Yet a he continues aging , not even Chapman think he will average 100 m.p.h . for an entire season anymore . Nor doe he want to , especially with the resurgence of his wipeout slider .
 “ My first few year , yes , I wa trying to throw hard ; it ’ s what I had , ” he said . “ But through the year , your mentality start changing . My objective now isn ’ t to throw a hard but to pitch . For example : tossing inning with a few pitch a possible or throwing first-pitch strike to every batter . ”
 There were time last season , a Chapman ’ s velocity hovered around 97 m.p.h. , that Larry Rothschild , the Yankees ’ longtime pitching coach , thought it might the new norm .
 “ But then you ’ d see the big number , ” Rothschild said . “ As it warms up and he get out there , you ’ ll still see them . But he ’ s thrown a lot of fastball at a very high velocity , so at some point , you ’ re going to see a little bit of a dip . ”
 It feel preposterous to doubt whether 97 m.p.h . is enough : Many professional pitcher are unable to throw that hard , let alone average it for an entire six-month season — and for many year . The average fastball in baseball last season wa 92.8 m.p.h. , according to Fangraphs . But Chapman is so freakishly athletic that he set a new norm .
 “ The year have gone by , and back then , ‘ the Cuban Missile ’ wa good , ” he said . “ But before , how many pitcher were throwing that hard ? Maybe two or three pitcher throwing over 100 . ”
 There are more now who can reach it , even starting pitcher . Chapman marveled at Hicks ’ s arm , which uncorked a 105 m.p.h . fastball in a game last May , matching Chapman for the fastest pitch in recorded baseball history . “ And there are some hard thrower who haven ’ t reached the big league yet , ” Chapman said .
 Even though Chapman ha mitigated his aging process by bulking up his once-gangly 6-foot-4 frame , his arm will continue to lose power over time . His fastball ha already induced fewer swing and miss each year ( 2017 and 2018 were his lowest rate since the start of his career ) .
 Still , a Chapman pointed out , even 96-m.p.h . fastball would be more than enough to succeed in the major — a long a he still get out . And in his seven outing this season , he mostly ha , allowing two run , taking one loss , striking out nine and walking one .
 Because they had sizable lead on Friday , the Yankees ( 9-10 ) didn ’ t need Chapman . Starter C.C . Sabathia allowed one unearned run over five inning , and the bullpen did the rest . Outfielders Brett Gardner and Mike Tauchman each homered , helping the Yankees overcome three error in the field .
 For Chapman , one thing that ha helped him evolve is his slider . Before departing via free agency after last season , reliever David Robertson helped Chapman tweak the grip on his slider , which led to sharper movement , and it proved successful in the second half .
 Chapman used his slider a career-high 25 percent of the time last season , partly at the Yankees ’ urging . Opponents hit .106 against it , and whiffed 62 percent of the time they swung — the highest rate for a slider among relief pitcher in baseball last season , according to Baseball Prospectus .
 And so far this season , the third of Chapman ’ s five-year , $ 86 million deal with the Yankees , he is using the slider even more : about 31 percent of the time . He said he had never felt better with it .
 “ That ’ s why the slider is not only a pitch here and now while he still ha electric stuff , but I think , a long a he want to do this and he ’ s healthy , that give him a pitch that ’ s going to give him longevity , ” Yankees Manager Aaron Boone said last month , adding later : “ It really impressed me last year when he started to use it more . There were time he wa able to strike that pitch better than his fastball . ”
 That is not to say that Chapman ’ s trademark pitch is feeble just yet . After seeing fastball of 95 and 96 m.p.h . from Chapman in the ninth inning of an April 6 game , Baltimore Orioles outfielder Trey Mancini struck out on a 98 m.p.h . offering down the middle of the plate .
 “ It seemed even harder , ” Mancini said . “ I thought that it wa probably 100 , just from the eye test . It ’ s still an electric pitch . He ’ s a really tall guy and when he release it , the ball seems like it ’ s right on top of you . ”
 Two day before that , Mancini saw three slider from Chapman , lining out on the final one .
 “ A lot of people don ’ t know : His slider is a pretty darn good pitch , ” Mancini said . “ And with age or anything like that , that slider is still going to make that fastball look really hard , even if it ’ s slightly le hard than it used to be . ”

 The Carpetbagger

 You know thing are going wrong with the Oscars when even Lin-Manuel Miranda get upset .
 The “ Hamilton ” star , who ha long cultivated a reputation a Twitter ’ s crown prince of positivity , reached his breaking point last week after it wa reported that the Oscar broadcast would run only two performance from the five nominated song .
 Most Oscar producer would regard this year ’ s best-song lineup a a rare gift , since many of the tune hail from box office behemoth and can be sung by big star . Still , on the telecast , the academy ha reportedly chosen to feature only “ Shallow ” from “ A Star Is Born ” and “ All the Stars ” from “ Black Panther . ”
 [ Here ’ s the complete Oscar ballot . ]
 Among those left in the cold are Jennifer Hudson , a consistent awards-show powerhouse who would have sung “ I ’ ll Fight ” from the documentary “ RBG , ” and Emily Blunt , the popular star of two of last year ’ s biggest hit , who could have performed “ The Place Where Lost Things Go ” from “ Mary Poppins Returns. ” The notion of excluding these artist from the broadcast didn ’ t sit well with Miranda , Blunt ’ s “ Mary Poppins Returns ” co-star .
 Miranda wa referring to another recent Oscar controversy , the decision to soldier on with no host for the show after Kevin Hart stepped down over offensive tweet , but the truth is that Oscar conflagration are happening on a regular basis these day , and many are of the academy ’ s own making .
 Take another decision , tweeted by the Variety reporter Kris Tapley on Sunday , to award the winner of the best-cinematography Oscar during a commercial break . The academy is exploring this option for several of the tech category to cut the length of this year ’ s show , and while those acceptance speech will probably be edited into the broadcast later that night in some kind of truncated form , reporter at the ceremony will be announcing the winner on social medium long before the home audience get to see them .
 Blowback to this idea wa fierce and immediate , with many blasting the academy president , John Bailey , who is himself a cinematographer . “ I ’ m offended by the proposed change to the telecast , ” tweeted the director and academy member Gina Prince-Bythewood ( “ Beyond the Lights ” ) . “ Filmmaking is a collection of craft and The Academy is the only award show that honor and amplifies all . As it should be . ”
 It should be , but will it ? At this point , the Oscars seem almost ashamed to put on a show . There will be no host nor overarching comic sensibility , most of the musical performance have apparently been cut ( including the nominated “ Ballad of Buster Scruggs ” song “ When a Cowboy Trades His Spurs for Wings ” ) , and plenty of worthy category will be shunted to the margin . Given the mandate by ABC to trim the length of the telecast , we can expect acceptance speech to be ever more quickly curtailed , and I ’ ll be surprised if we still see clip of the nominated performance , the sort of thing that might introduce some of these smaller movie to a wider audience .
 In other word , the Oscar telecast ha become an entertainment program determined to divest itself of all entertainment .
 Does the academy understand why we still tune into this show ? When I think back on the Oscars of yesteryear , I remember moment , not minute : a speech that surprise , a musical performance that connects , an unplanned line that becomes a part of history . If the academy isn ’ t going to leave room for those moment to happen , it might a well issue a press release instead of a broadcast .
 The Oscars ought to take a few cue from the Super Bowl , another mammoth entertainment event that refuse to be ashamed of it size . When the Super Bowl is broadcast this Sunday , producer won ’ t be forced to choose between either the national anthem or the halftime show , or eliminate overtime if the game go long . They understand that people want the Super Bowl to be a maximal a possible , a communal watching experience that give u plenty to talk about . Why can ’ t the Oscars be a unabashed ?
 Even the Super Bowl ’ s most annoying feature — endless commercial interruption — ha been rebranded a one of it greatest strength : You now watch not just to see which team prevails , but to debate what high-profile ad won the night , too . Instead of apologizing for the Oscars ’ length , ABC could take similar advantage of it by stuffing the commercial break with exclusive footage from “ Avengers : Endgame ” or “ Toy Story 4 , ” two film to be released by the network ’ s fellow Disney subsidiary Marvel and Pixar .
 There are plenty of other organic , exciting way to work those blockbuster into the broadcast , and they can even help restore some of the category the academy want to cut from the show . Is a sound-mixing Oscar the most scintillating thing to present during the telecast ? On it own , perhaps not , but what if you could show a clip of Beyoncé and Donald Glover mixing their duet of “ Can You Feel the Love Tonight ” from the forthcoming redo of “ The Lion King ” ? The presentation might take a little longer , but I doubt anyone would complain .
 So let ’ s embrace that attitude : Instead of apologizing for the show ’ s length , the academy should resolve to pack the Oscar broadcast full of major moment , no matter how long it go . Instead of antagonizing the craftspeople who should be celebrating the biggest night of their career , the Oscars should find a way to honor them by making every presentation a blockbuster event .
 As a kid , Lin-Manuel Miranda tuned in to the Oscars simply because he loved a movie , and there wa no show on earth that loved movie more . It ’ s time for the Oscars to prove they can still be that show .

 WASHINGTON — In a major test case , Medicare is poised to cover a promising but expensive new type of cancer treatment , with significant restriction meant to hold down the cost .
 Cancer patient , doctor and drug company are urging the Trump administration to remove the restriction and broaden coverage so more patient can benefit from the treatment , known a CAR T cell therapy , or CAR-T . But insurance company are pushing for the restriction .
 The treatment is manufactured specifically for each patient , and many more such “ personalized medicine ” are in the pipeline . Medicare ’ s final decision , expected in the next few week , will influence commercial insurer and state Medicaid program , which often follow it lead .
 Medicare and other insurer typically pay for drug a they are used , from month to month and year to year . By contrast , the CAR-T treatment generate high cost up front , but the benefit could last for year .
 The Food and Drug Administration ha approved two CAR-T product to treat certain blood cancer : Kymriah , made by Novartis , with a list price of $ 373,000 or $ 475,000 , depending on the type of cancer , and Yescarta , made by Gilead Sciences , with a list price of $ 373,000 .
 The treatment have been remarkably effective in some patient who had a dismal prognosis after exhausting other option . Researchers around the country are conducting more than 450 clinical trial to explore other us of CAR-T medicine that work in similar way .
 The Trump administration ha proposed covering CAR-T therapy when it is prescribed by a cancer specialist and given in a hospital to Medicare patient whose cancer ha not responded to other treatment like chemotherapy and radiation . Medicare would also cover the treatment for patient whose cancer return , causing a relapse after a period of improvement .
 Seema Verma , the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , ha described CAR-T a “ an entirely new approach to treating serious and even life-threatening disease . ”
 Dr. Francis S. Collins , the director of the National Institutes of Health , said that harnessing the power of a patient ’ s immune system in this way wa a “ marvel of modern medicine. ” But “ because of the need to personalize the preparation of cell for every patient , ” he said , “ cost are quite high , and it could be truly challenging to scale up use of the technology . ”
 Officials will increasingly confront such challenge a they try to ensure that Medicare beneficiary have access to the latest treatment at an affordable cost .
 CAR-T therapy sound like science fiction . Immune cell — T cell — are removed from a patient ’ s blood , sent to a laboratory where they are genetically engineered to recognize and attack cancer cell , and then sent back to the hospital for infusion into the patient .
 The total cost of treatment , including the CAR-T infusion , doctor ’ service and hospital stay , can easily exceed $ 750,000 .
 “ This look like a big price tag , ” said Dr. Caron A. Jacobson , director of a cell therapy program at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston . “ But when you actually consider what you are paying for over the course of someone ’ s lifetime , and you think about the cost of other therapy that this is replacing , it actually is not astronomical . ”
 There is no national Medicare policy for covering CAR T cell therapy . The request for a Medicare coverage decision came from one of the nation ’ s largest insurer , UnitedHealth Group , which expressed concern that “ CAR-T therapy could create significant financial risk ” for the government and for private Medicare Advantage plan .
 UnitedHealth is the largest provider of Medicare Advantage plan , with about five million people enrolled in it plan . The private plan receive a fixed monthly payment from the government to provide the full range of service covered by Medicare .
 America ’ s Health Insurance Plans , a trade group for insurer , also urged caution , saying , “ There is currently limited evidence for CAR-T therapy . ”
 But Bonnie Falbo of Charlottesville , Va. , a caregiver for her 70-year-old husband , who ha multiple myeloma , said : “ This treatment is one that could save his life one day . Immunotherapy is the future of cancer care . Approving payment for this therapy right now will save the life of patient who have run out of other option . ”
 Advocates for patient and physician group said the coverage policy proposed by the Trump administration wa too limited and could delay lifesaving treatment for cancer patient who were very ill .
 “ We have a new therapy , a result of year of research , and it ha been approved by the F.D.A. , ” said Kirsten A. Sloan , a vice president of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network . “ Let ’ s make sure people have access to it . Let the doctor decide which patient should be eligible . A patient ’ s health care provider is in the best position to determine when and whether a patient will benefit from CAR T cell therapy and should not be limited by a narrow coverage policy . ”
 Ted Okon , the executive director of the Community Oncology Alliance , an advocacy group for cancer doctor and patient , said the coverage criterion proposed by the Trump administration were “ much more restrictive ” than the us of CAR-T therapy permitted in the F.D.A.-approved label .
 Moreover , Mr. Okon said , coverage should not be limited to patient treated at a hospital , a the government proposed . “ CAR-T treatment ha been slowly moving to the outpatient setting , ” he said . “ Many community oncology practice have the experience and capability to administer CAR-T treatment , saving money for patient and Medicare . ”
 Hospitals providing CAR-T therapy said they were trying to figure out how to pay for it .
 Charles N. Kahn III , the president and chief executive of the Federation of American Hospitals , which represents investor-owned hospital , said they faced large financial loss in providing the treatment to Medicare patient .
 “ This is a brave new world , ” Mr. Kahn said . “ No one anticipated such an extraordinary expense when Medicare ’ s hospital payment formula were adopted . ”
 Under the Trump administration proposal , Medicare would pay for CAR-T therapy in patient who have “ relapsed or refractory cancer ” that ha resisted other treatment .
 “ CAR T cell therapy show promise , ” the administration said in a 39,000-word decision memo , but “ the evidence is inadequate to confidently conclude ” that it will improve health outcome for Medicare beneficiary .
 To date , it said , “ few clinical trial on CAR T cell therapy have been performed , and those data available have limited participation by Medicare beneficiaries. ” More study is needed , it said .
 So Medicare would cover the procedure only if hospital agreed to monitor patient , enroll them in a study or “ registry ” and report detailed data on their medical condition and quality of life for at least two year after treatment .
 Doctors and scientific researcher raised several concern .
 The eligibility requirement “ may exclude some patient who could benefit from treatment , ” said Cynthia A. Bens , a senior vice president of the Personalized Medicine Coalition , an education and advocacy group .
 Dr. Roy L. Silverstein , the president of the American Society of Hematology , said it wa “ shortsighted to limit coverage to those patient who have not responded to chemotherapy or have relapsed after chemotherapy . ”
 “ I can predict with pretty good certainty that there will be indication not too far in the future for using these treatment a part of the initial therapeutic plan for patient with certain kind of cancer , ” Dr. Silverstein said .

 An Appraisal
 By Melissa Errico
 I still hear Michel Legrand ’ s voice in my head : “ Melissa ! Hurry ! Come ! ”
 It wa morning at the Music Box Theater , an early rehearsal during the first preview of his 2002 Broadway musical “ Amour. ” It wa 10:01 a.m. , and we were all moving slowly , nursing coffee cup in the palm of our hand . We had performed the show the night before and were still easing into the day .
 Michel , the three-time Oscar-winning film composer who died on Saturday at 86 , didn ’ t want to waste a minute . He pulled on my arm , speaking fast in heavily accented English , insisting that we must find a piano . As we scurried to the theater ’ s downstairs lobby , he told me he had written a new song for my character , Isabelle , and it would go into the show that evening . We flew down the gilded stair , and I sat at his side at the piano .
 What I remember most wa the change in Michel ’ s body language a he shared his new music . Once at the piano , he slowed down and became absorbed . He would rush you a if to an American ice cream parlor on a crowded summer afternoon — and then offer you a slowly simmered French meal . I sat a he played , and marveled quietly when his hand turned the melody unexpectedly , a new minor key , a delicious twist that only he could have invented .
 Of course the song , “ Other People ’ s Stories , ” with lyric by Jeremy Sams , wa beautiful , perhaps the best remembered in the show . And it wa in “ Amour ” by 7 p.m. that night , typed hurriedly by a stage manager and taped into a magazine prop so I could literally read it a I sang in front of a thousand people .
 This mix of wild energy and plaintive emotion governed Michel ’ s extravagantly well-lived life . Music wa urgent to him . Well , almost everything wa urgent to him — try hailing a New York taxi with him , oh ! , the impatience — and then at the piano , he wa transformed , calm .
 It ’ s almost impossible to believe what a day with Michel could be like . Once , while we were recording in Paris , he suddenly asked if my husband , Patrick , and I would like to fly with him to Spain for a quick vacation . We shrugged and agreed . Only after we got to the airport did we realize that he really meant “ fly with him ” — he wa the pilot of his own tiny plane , and flew u out through a rainstorm over the Pyrenees .
 Landing for a picnic lunch , we had hardly caught our breath when he happily explained that he wa due that night in Andorra for a concert with the pianist Chucho Valdes , and we had been drafted a his driver . There we were in the front seat of a small French car , navigating our way across the terrifying corkscrew mountain road , while Michel practiced piano in the back seat on a specially constructed wooden keyboard . ( “ Can you please go straighter ! ” he demanded of my poor husband . ) The concert , when it happened , wa a hurricane force of free music , with dueling pianist scatting on Michel ’ s classic “ Watch What Happens , ” stretching it to 15 ecstatic minute .
 Two year after “ Amour , ” he and I decided to make an album together , an ambitious symphonic recording eventually called “ Legrand Affair. ” He came to Manhattan , and we spent a few day rehearsing his song . Once we settled on a sensibility for the album , Michel went wild . One day in my apartment , he called the lyricist Alan and Marilyn Bergman on the telephone : “ I need a new verse for Melissa ! For ‘ You Must Believe In Spring ! ’ Now , now ! It ’ s too short ! Too short ! ”
 Mere hour later , a fax came through from the Bergmans , with a new verse , adapted to that post-9/11 moment . That wa what Michel ’ s energy could produce in others .
 Michel could listen , too , a well a ask . He loved that I saw his “ The Windmills of Your Mind ” a a poem about insomnia , and concentrated on orchestrating my interpretation . His career wa full of positive and empowering relationship with woman , from Agnès Varda to Barbra Streisand to me , and , most obviously , with Marilyn Bergman . Those relationship were never like that of an artist feeding a mannequin or “ muse . ”
 “ Music is feeling , then , not sound , ” wrote Wallace Stevens . And Michel wa a uniquely feeling musician . His sensibility worked superbly in film , especially in the enchanting “ The Umbrellas of Cherbourg , ” which offered an unending spool of emotion . But even in the television cartoon series “ Futurama , ” when his “ I Will Wait for You ” from that film appears , it brings a true sense of loss and longing to a silly story about dog cloning .
 The last song Michel sent my way wa called “ Hurry Home , ” written for a small Jerry Lewis movie released in 2016 , “ Max Rose. ” It wa one more beautiful melancholy Legrand melody , and listening to it now , it feel like a tribute to him . Unlike our orchestral album , it wa stripped down , recorded with just piano and guitar . We were thrilled by the many positive response .
 “ Ah , Melissa , a happy avalanche ! ” wa how he described it . A perfect phrase from Michel — but also for Michel , a happy human avalanche himself .

 True Detective
 By Scott Tobias
 The documentary-within-a-show in this season ’ s “ True Detective ” ha served a half illumination and half meta-commentary , a way to tease new thought from Detective Hays ’ s addled mind while taking shot at the current wave of true-crime doc , which have a tendency to dally around unresolved tragedy .
 Its director , Elisa Montgomery , may speak loftily about “ the intersectionality of marginalized group , ” but she is passing through Hays ’ s life like a tourist , gawking at 35 year of dead end , bad break and unfortunate lapse in judgment . And at the end of her stay , all Elisa can do is express disappointment over her visit : She knew he shared her skepticism over how the case wa resolved , but he couldn ’ t provide her with “ a missing piece . ”
 “ Young lady , ” he reply . “ my whole brain ’ s a bunch of missing piece . ”
 That sound like a typical Nic Pizzolatto line , another salty lament from the bottom of the bottle . It ’ s a feature of the show that Pizzolatto ’ s detective are broken people , because of either defining incident from their past or their obsession with the one big case that got away from them .
 Yet when Hays describes his brain a “ a bunch of missing piece , ” it account for the entire design of the third season , which reflects how memory work . Over three timeline , the show ha given u piece of a puzzle that have never fit to Hays ’ s satisfaction , prompting him to circle back over assumption and conclusion that haven ’ t stood up under scrutiny . By 2015 , there are no border in Hays ’ s mind between one time period and another : his visitation by the Viet Cong ; his late-night wandering to the Purcells ’ old neighborhood ; and , in this episode , his memory of burning a man ’ s clothes in the backyard to cover up an interrogation gone wrong .
 For Elisa , interviewing Hays ha been a frustrating act of excavation , a if she were spelunking into the dark , cavernous reach of his mind to discover some elusive gem . She ’ s ticked that she doesn ’ t find it , but Pizzolatto suggests that she hasn ’ t earned it : This case ha inspired her curiosity , but she hasn ’ t lived through it cascading tragedy and disappointment , so she doesn ’ t have the right to see it through .
 The nifty little twist in “ The Final Country ” is that Hays and West are using her for information , taking her theory on the case and following through on them after the shoot . The one-eyed man whom they had originally questioned about buying the corn husk doll in 1980 — the same man who castigated Amelia at a book reading a decade later — is identified a a possible “ procurer ” for a pedophile ring . That lead the elderly partner to interview a former domestic worker at the Hoyt estate , who describes a one-eyed man who worked closely with Hoyt and the secretive goings-on that led to her departure .
 By now it ’ s clear that some unseen hand ha been dictating where the investigation ha gone . In 1980 , the planting of Will ’ s backpack under the floorboard on Woodard ’ s deck wa enough to close the case and pin both murder on the dead scavenger , despite Julie ’ s body never turning up . In 1990 , Tom ’ s apparent suicide at Devil ’ s Den is staged to accomplish the same goal of putting the case to rest with the deceased . And when Hays and West tried , a free agent , to torture the truth out of Harris James , the gambit backfired so horribly that they couldn ’ t look into it any longer . A man in a black sedan ha likely made certain of that .
 The bigger picture is starting to come into focus . Through Amelia ’ s sleuthing in the 1990 timeline , we discover that cousin Dan had some discussion with the one-eyed man at the bar where Lucy once worked . Through phone record and flight log we also discover , again in 1990 , that call were exchanged between Lucy and a Hoyt number , and that Harris flew to Vegas the night before Lucy wa found dead from an overdose .
 The dot are not quite connectable yet , but Hoyt , Harris , Lucy , Dan and the one-eyed man are all playing role here , and no one , not least Hays and West , have had the power and political will to get to the bottom of it .
 The past few episode of “ True Detective ” have busied themselves with unpacking this horrific conspiracy , but this week ’ s episode wa especially effective in measuring the bruising cost of it — not just to our ragged hero , but to the community at large .
 An incidental moment from the 1990 timeline hit the hardest : After Amelia visit one of the Purcell ’ s neighbor and procures a photograph of Will and Julie on Halloween , she asks the woman if she ha ever thought about moving to town , away from this cursed place .
 “ Why would I ? ” the woman reply . “ Somebody ’ s got to stay . Somebody ’ s got to remember . ”
 There are more mundane reason that people continue to live in town and neighborhood like this after those community have collapsed . But home is home , even when staying feel like tending a graveyard .
 Flat Circles :
 • One mystery that hasn ’ t been addressed is why Hays is estranged from his daughter Becca , but leaving that an open question make her continued presence in his life more affecting . Here Hays is focused on a point of departure — first in a flashback when he drop her off at college , later when his dementia lead him to mistake a witness ’ s daughter for his own — and it seems possible that this may have been his last happy memory of her .
 • Amelia ’ s dropping a mention of “ In Cold Blood ” signal Pizzolatto ’ s own ambition , for better or worse . “ True Detective ” wa intended to be more than just another gruesome police procedural , even if it buckle under the weight of this pretension half the time .
 • This season ha been building around the existence of a pedophile ring , but it ha shown blessed restraint by not getting too explicit about it . The show hasn ’ t always favored leaving humanity ’ s ugliest impulse to the imagination .
 • So yes , the third season and the first season do exist in the same televisual universe . Let ’ s hope the Marvel-style crossover end there .

 The famous mathematical ratio , estimated to more than 22 trillion digit ( and counting ) , is the perfect symbol for our specie ’ long effort to tame infinity .
 By Steven Strogatz
 Adapted from “ Infinite Powers : How Calculus Reveals the Secrets of the Universe , ” which will be published on April 2 by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt .
 When my child were young , they liked to stare at a pie plate hanging in our kitchen , with the digit of pi running around the rim and spiraling in toward the center , shrinking in size a the number swirled into the abyss .
 Pi , a we all learned in school ( and are reminded every March 14 , on Pi Day ) , is defined a the ratio of a circle ’ s circumference to it diameter . Denoted by the Greek letter π , this curious little number is approximately 3.14 , although computer have calculated it out past 22 trillion digit and counting : 3.141592653589793238462643383279502… , a sequence never repeating , never betraying any pattern , going on forever , infinity on a platter .
 For some people , Pi Day is an occasion to marvel at circle , long revered a symbol of perfection , reincarnation and the cycle of nature . But it is the domestication of infinity that we really should be celebrating . Mathematically , pi is le a child of geometry than an early ancestor of calculus , the branch of mathematics , devised in the 17th century , that deal with anything that curve , move or change continuously .
 As a ratio , pi ha been around since Babylonian time , but it wa the Greek geometer Archimedes , some 2,300 year ago , who first showed how to rigorously estimate the value of pi . Among mathematician of his time , the concept of infinity wa taboo ; Aristotle had tried to banish it for being too paradoxical and logically treacherous . In Archimedes ’ s hand , however , infinity became a mathematical workhorse .

 He used it to discover the area of a circle , the volume of a sphere and many other property of curved shape that had stumped the finest mathematician before him . In each case , he approximated a curved shape by using a large number of tiny straight line or flat polygon . The resulting approximation were gemlike , faceted object that yielded fantastic insight into the original shape , especially when he imagined using infinitely many , infinitesimally small facet in the process .
 To get a feeling for this world-changing idea , imagine measuring the distance around a circular track near your house . To obtain an estimate , you could walk one lap and then consult a pedometer app on your phone to see how far you traveled . A pedometer computes the distance straightforwardly : It estimate the length of your stride based on your height ( which you typed into the app ) , and it count how many step you ’ ve taken . Then it multiplies stride length time the number of step to calculate how far you walked .
 Archimedes used a similar method to estimate the circumference of a circle , and so to estimate pi . Again , imagine walking around a circular track . The resulting path would look something like this , with each step represented by a tiny straight line .
 Multiply the number of line by the length of each one to estimate the circumference of the circle . It ’ s only an approximation , of course : Each straight segment is a shortcut in place of what really is a curved arc . So the approximation is sure to underestimate the true length of the circle .
 But by taking enough step , and making them small enough , you could approximate the length of the track a accurately a you wanted . For example , path with six , 12 and 24 step would do an increasingly good job of hugging the circle .
 Archimedes performed a similar series of calculation , starting with a hexagonal path made up of six straight step . The advantage of a hexagon wa that he could calculate both the length of it perimeter ( which approximates the circle ’ s circumference ) and it diameter ( which coincides with the circle ’ s diameter ) .
 The perimeter is exactly six time the radius r of the circle , or 6r . That ’ s because the hexagon contains six equilateral triangle , each side of which equal the circle ’ s radius . The diameter of the hexagon , for it part , is two time the circle ’ s radius , or 2r .
 Now recall that the perimeter of the hexagon underestimate the true circumference of the circle . So the ratio of these two hexagonal distance — 6r/2r = 3 — must represent an underestimate of pi . Therefore , the unknown value of pi , whatever it equal , must be greater than 3 .
 Of course , six is a ridiculously small number of step , and the resulting hexagon is a crude caricature of a circle , but Archimedes wa just getting started . Once he figured out what the hexagon wa telling him , he shortened the step and took twice a many of them . Then he kept doing that , over and over again .
 A man obsessed , he went from 6 step to 12 , then 24 , 48 and ultimately 96 step , using standard geometry to work out the ever-shrinking length of the step to migraine-inducing precision . By using a 96-sided polygon inside the circle , and also a 96-sided polygon outside the circle , he ultimately proved that pi is greater than 3 + 10/71 and le than 3 + 10/70 .
 Take a moment to savor the result visually :
 3 + 10/71 < π < 3 + 10/70 .
 The unknown value of pi is being trapped in a numerical vise , squeezed between two number that look almost identical , except the first ha a denominator of 71 and the last ha a denominator of 70 . By considering polygon with even more side , later mathematician tightened the vise even further . Around 1,600 year ago , the Chinese geometer Zu Chongzhi pondered polygon having an incredible 24,576 side to squeeze pi out to eight digit :
 3.1415926 < π < 3.1415927 .
 By allowing the number of side in the polygon to increase indefinitely , all the way out to infinity , we can generate a many digit of pi a we like , at least in principle .
 In taming infinity , Archimedes paved the way for the invention of calculus 2,000 year later . And calculus , in turn , helped make the world modern . Archimedes ’ s mathematical strategy is used in computer-generated movie , approximating Shrek ’ s smooth belly and trumpet-like ear with million of tiny polygon . The smooth glide of an Ella Fitzgerald song is digitally represented in streaming audio by an enormous number of bit .
 In every field of human endeavor , from reconstructive facial surgery to the simulation of air flowing past a jet ’ s wing , billion of tiny , discrete element stand in for an inherently smooth and analog reality . It all began with the computation of pi . Pi represents a mathematical limit : an aspiration toward the perfect curve , steady progress toward the unreachable star . It exists , clear a night , with no end in sight .

 Letter of Recommendation
 By Henry Wismayer
 I can still vividly recall the first spider web I watched being spun in earnest , in the unlikely setting of an industrial estate in Central London . While taking a break from a tedious data-entry job , I stepped outside onto a fire escape to find a dun-brown spider dangling at eye level from the wrought iron . Ordinarily I would have swatted it away with a wave of the arm . But something about this creature persuaded me to stop and observe a she traversed back and forth between stair and balustrade , constructing an elaborate death trap . From frame to completion , the spider ’ s labor took about an hour , and I scrutinized the whole thing , entranced — which might help explain why I wa sacked later that week .
 Now , on long summer day , if I find myself with a few spare minute , I go into my scrap of South London garden to scour the border and branch for telltale strand of spider silk . And , if luck brings me into contact with a spider at work , I pull up a chair and watch . If you ’ re one of the many people who fear spider , I appreciate that this may sound like an inexplicable choice of hobby . Perhaps you ’ d prefer to imagine that spider don ’ t exist , or at least that they never cross your path . But they do . And it ’ s actually the same alien quality that compel many of u to abhor spider that lend web-building it mesmerizing quality .
 Examining a web up close , you can not help marveling at the ethereal quality of the silk , a substance of such incredible tensile strength and elasticity that human have spent more than 50 year trying to synthesize it property . You wonder too at the genius of the radial line , a scaffolding more intricate than the most advanced suspension bridge . But most of all , you watch the leg , the rear one tugging silk from the spinnerets on the abdomen , others delicately gauging the distance between the anchor point . The extraordinary eight-legged motion — so creepy when you see it on your bedroom wall — becomes a thing of wonder when you look harder .
 For the time it take to build a web , the leg tug , sever , glue and measure , unless the builder sens a serious disturbance , in which case it will rappel to safety , leg akimbo in kung-fu readiness . Some naturalist speculate that spider , like the octopus , have limb that operate with a degree of autonomy . Indeed , they work with such piston-like coordination that it is hard to conceive of one poppy-seed-size brain controlling them all .
 The most virtuosic example of spider architecture is the orb , built by the family Araneidae , whose specie are common all over the world . Unlike cobweb spider , which tend to construct their tangled trap in ceiling crevice , an orb-weaver ’ s handiwork appears in more conspicuous place , often along garden border , where prey is abundant . The best time to catch spider establishing their foundation is at dawn or dusk , from late summer through early fall , when they send out gossamer strand , which , deployed onto a breeze , enable them to parasail across chasm in search of a hunter ’ s vantage . If you spot these thread , the web-building process will not be far behind .
 My favorite time to seek out web is in the early hour , when spider silk is at it most splendid , often glistening with dew . On busy day , my web-watching might comprise little more than a brief reconnaissance of my garden before I start work : here a web dotted in fresh prey , it owner happily sated by it breakfast of liquefied aphid innards ; there one damaged by some nocturnal disturbance , it owner half-concealed on a stem of honeysuckle , already busy planning a replacement . By mentally mapping the shift in the local webscape over each 24-hour cycle , I ’ ve found that the spider ’ relentless industry provides a shot of inspiration for the day ahead .
 We are increasingly advised , by writer and wellness guru , to seek sanctuary from our hyperdigitized life in nature . For year , working a a travel writer , an inconsistent line of work that served a shallow cover for a flâneurial pursuit of spectacular thing , I took this imperative to extreme . If my foot itched for experiential refreshment , my first recourse would be to switch off my phone and flee the city to go somewhere with hill , forest , beast — the wilder the better . It is a source of no small rapture , then , with a young family requiring a more sedentary life , to discover a surrogate for this impulse in something so ignored and ubiquitous , often within a few foot of my door .
 So much of the meditative and aesthetic communion we seek in nature find expression in these miniature coliseum . In design , their gratuitous beauty humbles u into reflection on the divine ; in cruelty of purpose , they are a memento mori , a symbol of ineluctable fate embodied in the futile wriggling of an ensnared fly . Perhaps a web ’ s most poignant allegory , however , lie in the disdain with which we tend to treat them — the appreciation that most of u , whether through overfamiliarity or revulsion , think nothing of obliterating that which required such balletic artistry to build . In this way , spider web betray the tragedy of our indifference when we are too busy to see .

 This ha been an uneven season . On top of the usual demand — two time period , two country , two major couple , a villain , an ever-expanding supporting cast — there were the racial issue of colonial America , Brianna ’ s rape , and the fracturing of the Frasers . No wonder this week ’ s episode struggled to weave thing back together a we near the season finale .
 It ’ s so busy that we get only one glimpse of Jamie , Claire and Ian . There just isn ’ t time for more , given everything else . Fergus and Marsali stage a jailbreak to get Murtagh out of enemy hand . Brianna and Lord John take a road trip to confront Stephen Bonnet . And Roger ha a rotten time in the Mohawk village , meet two new friend and end up lighting one of them on fire . Busy week .
 The most satisfying subplot is Brianna ’ s . Not the actual encounter with Bonnet — that ’ s a real casualty of this episode ’ s rush . Bonnet race from the season ’ s monster to tearful fatherhood , and Brianna practically pingpongs back and forth from the cell door a they battle for the last word . Sophie Skelton and Ed Speleers do their best to give weight to the rapid-fire confrontation , but given how long Brianna ha suffered , there ’ s just not enough time for her to settle all those ghost .
 No , the most satisfying thing about Brianna ’ s journey is watching her navigate it with Lord John , who turn out to be a dream co-pilot . He tell her immediately that Bonnet ha been caught . When she say she want to see him , Lord John express concern , but he respect her wish and offer his help . And in the jail , he honor her choice to go in alone but promise he is nearby if she need him .
 “ You are impossible not to like , ” Brianna marvel . That ’ s by design . The show is determined to make you love Lord John . He is shot in endlessly warm light and is endlessly accommodating . Even his sharp edge are getting smoothed over . ( He ha been a champion of British order against the regulator , but he happily cover for Murtagh . )
 And he ’ s quickly building a rapport with Brianna . It might not be passionate , but it is respectful , which is a nice counterpoint to how other men in her life have treated her .
 Even Jamie ’ s loving letter warns her how important it is that she forgive Bonnet and try not to take revenge . That may be well-intentioned , but it is also a little rich coming from a man currently on a road trip to rescue the guy he nearly killed for revenge . And speaking of that guy , Roger resents his life so much right now that it ’ s weird she can ’ t feel it 600 mile south .
 This episode seems to delight in comparing Brianna ’ s two marriage option , a the camera cut from the considerate , informative , respectful Lord John to Roger , getting more grizzled by the minute a he mutter about his heartbreak : “ I ’ ve learned something from my pain … look out for No . 1 . Well , from now on , that ’ s me. ” He ’ s so cynical that he manages to alienate a priest ( Yan Tual ) who had been in solitary confinement .
 It ’ s hard to fault Roger for being bitter a he sits in prison impossibly far from home . And yet he ha been driven to this despair not by any awareness of his own fault , but by the machination of a subplot that ha encapsulated a lot of this season ’ s problem with race .
 The Mohawk were cruel slavedrivers a they brought Roger north , and now they ’ re cruel villager — beating Roger , imprisoning the priest and quickly resorting to murder by torture . ( There is also the implication that the torture order come from the jealous suitor ( Braeden Clarke ) of a Mohawk woman in love with the white priest , which doe not help . ) And Roger , who veered back and forth frequently from protagonist to antihero this season , get to play hero at the expense of the Mohawk .
 As the Mohawk slowly roast the tragic and handsome priest , Roger barrel through the village , tossing accelerant onto the pyre to end it faster . A tearful Johiehon ( Sera-Lys McArthur ) set aside her baby and race into the flame , a Roger and the Mohawk villager stand aghast at the spectacle . And all the while , “ Adagio for Strings ” play — a musical shortcut to suggest tragedy , scoring a scene that doesn ’ t have the groundwork to be tragic on it own . And though Roger ’ s time with the Mohawk isn ’ t quite over , it ’ s hard to imagine this subplot will develop much nuance from here .
 With one episode left in the season , there are plenty of loose end to tie up . Circumstances increasingly point to dramatic reunion , rather than engaging with the wider historical issue of this season ’ s narrative . It will be telling to see what thing “ Outlander ” wrap next episode , and what it leaf out in the cold .
 Other Gossip :
 • I appreciate Fergus ’ s face a he realizes that of all the jail in all the city in all the colony in all the world , Lord John and Brianna Fraser end up in his jailbreak .
 • The Mohawk story is deeply disappointing , but it ’ s good to hear Mohawk spoken in the village scene , and Sera-Lys McArthur is memorable with very little a Johiehon .
 • You know John ’ s a keeper when he asks permission before touching a pregnant woman .
 • The lingering question of this episode is whether Bonnet ’ s speedy contrition is enough that we don ’ t mind if he survived that explosion . Guess we ’ ll find out .

 There is no shortage of Lionel Messi content on the World Wide Web . The 31-year-old soccer superstar rank high in survey of top Google search , one of just a few human being to earn a spot among such keyword perennial a “ Facebook , ” “ weather ” and “ free porn. ” In a 2015 tally of the most Googled person in each nation on earth , Messi tied Kim Kardashian for the most No . 1 , with a global reach that extended from his native Argentina to Haiti , Turkmenistan , Senegal and 22 other country .
 Messi is also one of the world ’ s pre-eminent viral video star . Countless clip document “ Messi magic , ” a playing style of almost unseemly brilliance . On social medium , user share video of Messi ’ s slipping pass through improbably tight space , corkscrewing shot past sprawling goalkeeper , darting around defender like a jack rabbit navigating a gantlet of sloth . Type “ Messi ” into a YouTube search field , and you will find hundred of highlight compilation with bombastic title : “ Lionel Messi see thing we don ’ t even consider , ” “ Lionel Messi : — A God Amongst Men , ” “ Lionel Messi : Extraterrestrial . ”
 So it wa not exactly surprising when , on March 17 , the internet wa captivated by a Messi goal . It came in the 85th minute of a 4-1 victory for Messi ’ s club team , FC Barcelona , over the Seville-based Real Betis . Messi gathered the ball about 24 yard from the Betis goal , slid a pas to his teammate Ivan Rakitić and then flowed forward to receive a return pas . The goal that followed wa so easeful , so understated , that it wa momentarily hard to process . Messi struck the ball in full stride but with shocking delicacy , lifting a chip shot that arced gracefully across the penalty area . The ball drifted beyond the reach of the goalie , Pau López , scraped the underside of the crossbar and dropped into the goal . Messi had taken his shot from a diagonal position more than 20 yard away , but it wa not the stinging kick generally required to score from that spot . The ball ’ s trajectory wa languid and dreamy , like a gull gliding on an ocean breeze .
 Messi had already scored twice in the game . But the beauty and impudence of this goal — by some count , the 656th of Messi ’ s professional career — wa clear to all . Betis supporter stood to applaud their tormentor . Soccer pundit reached for celestial metaphor . On ESPN.com , the journalist Musa Okwonga wrote that “ the ball , with the glorious inevitability of our slowly dying sun , rose and fell. ” The wildest exultation came from the operatic English TV commentator Ray Hudson , who unleashed a torrent of mixed metaphor . “ The staggering genius of Lionel Messi ! ” he cried , during a live broadcast on the beIN SPORTS network . “ This miraculous footballer , this halo of a footballer ! ... He ’ s got an algebraic equation to solve in the blink of a baby ’ s eye , and he doe it in a way that is just so poetic ! ”
 Hudson is onto something with this talk of algebra and poetry . Messi ’ s greatness lie in his mind a much a his body . Watching replay of the goal , you marvel above all at the audacity of Messi ’ s idea . A chip ? From that distance , at that angle , in that frenzied moment of open-field play ? It ’ s nut — a fool ’ s fantasy that blossom , with every slow-motion replay , into wondrous fact . Messi saw something we didn ’ t even consider .
 That viral clip is a testament to Messi ’ s supernatural talent . It ’ s also a reminder that online video is changing the way we consume and conceptualize sport . Decades ago , the culture of “ highlight ” wa already transforming America ’ s pastime . The decline of slow-paced baseball , the ascendancy of the razzle-dazzle N.B.A. , the rule change that have brought an offensive explosion in the N.F.L . — these development were fueled in no small part by the rise of ESPN ’ s SportsCenter and the primacy of video clip . But in the old day , those highlight package were appointment viewing , available only on nightly broadcast . Today highlight spread across the web in second , mutating into meme and turning star athlete into visual brand . You don ’ t have to be a purist to wonder how this medium ecosystem is affecting our tolerance for the natural rhythm and longueur of sport , those lengthy stretch of “ lowlight ” play that are only occasionally punctuated by thrill .
 Soccer is a subtle game ; in general , goal are hard to come by . It would seem to be the major sport most antithetical to highlight culture . ( For all those moment of Messi magic , the essence of his greatness may lie in untelegenic maneuverings off the ball , the cagey movement that put him into position where he can erupt . ) But viral video is altering our view of soccer ’ s history . Today ’ s fan compare clip while endlessly debating the “ greatest of all time ” status of Messi and his chief rival , the Portuguese striker Cristiano Ronaldo . The GOATs of previous era — like Pelé , Johan Cruyff and Diego Maradona — recede into the background : They had the misfortune to play in a time before a footballer ’ s every exploit wa captured on video . If a player ’ s “ receipt ” aren ’ t on YouTube , he ’ s liable to lose to his toehold in the historiography .
 Yet for the 21st-century soccer fan , online video is a godsend — the only conceivable way to keep up with the ultimate global sport . With a mobile phone and a well-curated social medium feed , it is now possible to follow great match on five different continent , nearly every day , in real time .
 As for Messi : I know few more pleasurable way to kill a couple of hour than by squinting at a liquid-crystal screen , bugging out to the like of “ Lionel Messi Humiliating Players Two or More Times in the Same Play. ” Messi is the quintessential internet-age soccer star — he scored his first goal for Barcelona in 2005 , the year YouTube went online — but his persona is a throwback to an earlier period . He is a trickster and a funnyman , like an old-time silent-movie star . He ’ s small and scrappy , standing just 5-foot-7 , the Charlie Chaplin to suave Ronaldo ’ s Rudolph Valentino . Many of his greatest moment play out like slapstick farce , leaving pratfalling defender littered across the pitch .
 At their best , sport like soccer are the digital age ’ s most reliable supplier of an old-fashioned brand of entertainment , the special-effects-free kind , in which human being use only their sinew and synapsis to deliver thrill and spill , action and comedy . Messi ’ s chip in the Betis match wa a comedic set piece in it own right . On YouTube , you can find video montage of the play ’ s aftermath : Messi and his teammate celebrating and cracking up , the goalie López mugging like an exasperated vaudeville straight man , play-by-play announcer dissolving in peal of laughter . The goal is a cosmic joke if there ever wa one . A small man swing his left leg ; a ball loop skyward ; common sense and natural law are suspended . You know the punch line : The ball will fall back to earth , landing — plop — in the back of the net . But no matter how many time you watch it , the gag still kill .

 After decade of nearly slapstick mismanagement — spinning off TV and missing the internet — the studio behind “ The Godfather ” is fighting for it life .

 It wa a legendary Hollywood battle , one filled with so much back-stabbing and subterfuge that Vanity Fair likened it to a horror movie : “ ‘ Wall Street ’ a directed by Hitchcock . ”
 For month starting in the fall of 1993 , two medium titan , Sumner M. Redstone and Barry Diller , fought each other for what wa then the entertainment industry ’ s ultimate prize : Paramount Pictures , the 62-acre studio behind classic film like “ The Godfather ” and “ Chinatown ” and contemporary blockbuster like “ Top Gun ” and “ Beverly Hills Cop . ”
 The home entertainment boom wa showering Hollywood with cash . But Paramount wa more than a money machine . Legacy studio like Paramount — founded in the 1910s , operating sumptuous soundstage complex and controlling vast film library — rarely came up for sale . Owning one made you a permanent power player , a certified member of the cultural elite .
 With a bid of $ 9.75 billion , or $ 17 billion in today ’ s money , Mr. Redstone ’ s Viacom took the spoil . “ Don ’ t tell me I don ’ t buy you anything for your birthday , ” he told his then-wife , Phyllis , a they celebrated with lawyer at the 21 Club in New York .
 Flash forward 25 year , and Paramount once again find itself at the center of a battle . Only this time the historic studio is not the belle of the Hollywood ball , not even remotely . Today , Paramount is fighting for it very existence .
 Almost slapstick mismanagement by Viacom — cleaving off a lucrative TV business , firing the horror maestro Jason Blum , missing the opportunity to buy Marvel Entertainment , describing Steven Spielberg a “ completely immaterial ” — ha left Paramount on life support . The studio racked up nearly $ 900 million in loss between 2016 and 2018 . It ha placed last at the domestic box office for seven year running . The 29-soundstage Paramount lot is long overdue for improvement ; $ 700 million in upgrade , unveiled in 2011 , have yet to happen .
 Paramount , along with the rest of Hollywood , is also colliding with Silicon Valley . Netflix , which occupies a rented office tower six block from Paramount headquarters , ha been swallowing the entertainment business whole . This year , the streaming service will pump out about 90 movie , including documentary . To compare , the five conventional studio left standing — Paramount , Universal , Sony , Disney and Warner Bros. — will make about that many combined . Paramount is set to contribute 13 .
 The old-line film business is only going to become tougher a streaming service proliferate . Apple intends to roll out it multibillion-dollar TV and movie offering in the month ahead . Facebook ha recently gotten serious about marketing it Watch video-on-demand platform . Scrambling to keep pace , entertainment company like Disney and Warner Media have bulked up — Disney with it $ 71.3 billion purchase of 21st Century Fox asset and Warner by selling itself to AT & T for $ 85.4 billion — and plan to introduce their own megawatt streaming service by the end of the year . Next to those supertanker , Viacom is the corporate equivalent of a canoe .
 All of which ha agent , director , writer and producer confronting uncomfortable question . Can Paramount — the studio that , more than any other , symbolizes Hollywood itself — find a path forward a a stand-alone studio ? Or , a they did at Fox , could it end credit roll ?
 “ I knew it wa challenged , ” said Jim Gianopulos , a veteran film executive who took over a Paramount ’ s chairman in 2017 and is leading a resuscitation effort . “ I didn ’ t know how much . ”
 Stroll around the Paramount lot , a we did one afternoon late last year , and you ’ ll see a frenzy of activity . Fleets of forklift carry newly fabricated set from the in-house woodworking mill . Gardeners tend the hibiscus hedge . Electricians hang light . Production staffer whiz around on golf cart . At a glance , Paramount seems every bit a vibrant a it wa when Mr. Redstone took over in 1994 .
 But the bustle is mostly an illusion . Few movie are shot in Los Angeles anymore , by Paramount or any studio . Of the 100 top-grossing film in 2017 , only 10 were shot in California , according to Film L.A. , which track production . It ’ s cheaper to make movie in state like New Mexico and Georgia , which offer fat subsidy . TV series are still taped on studio lot , but Mr. Redstone chopped his business empire into two piece in 2005 , and Paramount ’ s entire small-screen division went to the CBS Corporation .
 Paramount in many way ha become a glorified rental property . HBO lease Stage 17 for “ Barry , ” a comedy about a hit man who want to change profession . The weepy “ This Is Us , ” a Fox production that air on NBC , sprawl across three stage . Sony and Amazon rent other Paramount stage .
 “ The decision to move all of Paramount TV really crippled Paramount Studios , ” said Frank J. Biondi Jr. , who ran Viacom from 1987 to 1996 .
 Along with filling stage , TV production provides studio with a stable revenue stream — something to fall back on when big-budget film bomb , a some inevitably do . TV ha also been Hollywood ’ s growth engine over the last decade . At least 495 original scripted program aired in 2018 , up from 288 in 2012 , the result of new buyer like Netflix and Hulu .
 To pull Paramount back from the brink , Mr. Gianopulos and a new lieutenant , Nicole Clemens , are rebuilding the studio ’ s TV operation . Paramount restarted television production in 2013 and now ha nine series running , including “ The Alienist ” on TNT and “ Jack Ryan ” on Amazon Prime . Mr. Gianopulos said he hoped to have 20 series in production by the end of the year . Viacom said Paramount Television generated $ 400 million in revenue last year ; Mr. Gianopulos said the division ’ s profit wa on track to double this year compared with 2018 .
 With the pressure on her to deliver , Ms. Clemens wa still zealously working at 6 p.m. on a recent Friday . As we waited outside her office door , two assistant dialed phone a if their life depended on it .
 Ms. Clemens eventually came out from behind her desk . “ Oh , this is calm , ” she said . “ You should have seen u earlier . ”
 As important a TV is to Paramount ’ s financial future , Mr. Gianopulos said movie would always be the company ’ s anchor . To that end , in September 2017 he hired one of Hollywood ’ s top producer , Wyck Godfrey , whose resume includes the “ Twilight ” blockbuster , a president of the film division . Supporting Mr. Godfrey are new marketing , publicity and animation chief .
 “ It sound trite , but you are only a good a your team , ” Mr. Gianopulos said . “ And all of the key people that I have brought in are accomplished , experienced executives. ” He added of the new hire , perhaps commenting indirectly on hothead who have left the studio : “ None of them are screamer . None of them are hyperbolic . They ’ re all grown-ups . They ’ re all collaborative . ”
 Mr. Godfrey had experienced Paramount ’ s dysfunction firsthand a a producer . In 2016 , the studio abruptly pulled the plug on one of his project , a movie adaptation of John Green ’ s novel “ Looking for Alaska , ” amid a casting dispute .
 “ From my outsider ’ s perspective , this place had become very fear-based , and so my first job wa to try and change that , ” Mr. Godfrey said . “ I ’ ve said to anyone who will listen , ‘ We are going to start taking real chance on thing we believe in. ’ I will take the responsibility , the heat , when we miss , which is inevitable . But just go for it .
 “ We have to make more movie and also movie that stand the test of time , ” he continued . “ We have no choice . It ’ s the only way. ” Paramount hope to make 17 movie in 2020 .
 Mr. Godfrey ’ s coming film lineup emphasizes big-budget , global-audience movie , known in Hollywood a tentpoles . A long-gestating “ Top Gun ” sequel is finally happening . Mr. Godfrey is working to breathe life into the tired “ Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles , ” “ Terminator , ” “ Star Trek ” and “ G.I . Joe ” franchise . Paramount also ha high hope for film tied to Viacom ’ s cable network , including “ Dora the Explorer , ” a live-action , big-screen adaptation of the Nickelodeon cartoon .
 Whatever it box-office viability , though , such fare doesn ’ t quite scream “ stand the test of time . ”
 But Mr. Godfrey insisted otherwise . Imagine , for instance , Paramount giving “ Star Trek ” to Quentin Tarantino . “ Suddenly people ’ s eye light up , ” Mr. Godfrey said . “ Yours just did . ”
 He also pointed out that “ Mission : Impossible — Fallout , ” released by Paramount in August , had proved naysayer wrong . That film , the sixth chapter in a 23-year-old series , received euphoric review and generated $ 791 million in global ticket sale , 16 percent more than it franchise predecessor . Two more “ Mission : Impossible ” installment starring Tom Cruise are moving ahead .
 “ Fallout ” and another unexpected hit from last spring , “ A Quiet Place , ” helped Paramount post an operating loss of $ 39 million for 2018 , compared with a loss of $ 280 million a year earlier . To compare , the industry leading Walt Disney Studios had 2018 profit of $ 2.98 billion , up from $ 2.36 billion .
 More recent Paramount movie have delivered mixed result . “ Bumblebee , ” a well-reviewed “ Transformers ” prequel , ha taken in roughly $ 370 million , a respectable number if not exactly a breakout hit . A pair of fall comedy , “ Nobody ’ s Fool ” and “ Instant Family , ” fizzled at the box office .
 Mr. Gianopulos said a turnaround wa still early . He expects the studio to return to profitability this year . “ In a four-quarter game , ” he said , “ we ’ re halfway through the second quarter . ”
 Ask Hollywood ’ s power broker how Paramount went from prestige to debris and they will say they don ’ t want to speak ill of the dead . And then they will proceed , at length and with great verve , to speak ill of the dead .
 Mr. Gianopulos ’ s predecessor , Brad Grey , who led the studio for 12 year , resigned under pressure in February 2017 . He died from cancer three month later , stunning the movie capital . Almost no one knew he wa sick .
 Looking back , there were signal . Toward the end of his run , Mr. Grey wa rarely seen at Paramount . A rumor took hold , calcifying into legend , that his chauffeur would drive the car onto the lot and park — so it would look a if Mr. Grey were somewhere on the premise — and then take a taxi home . The studio ’ s vice chairman , Rob Moore , wa also frequently away . He spent a lot of time in China , where he worked on an unconsummated deal to sell a minority stake in the studio . He wa also dating a Chinese TV host .
 An absentee overlord may have contributed to the studio ’ s decline , but the decay can be traced to Mr. Redstone ’ s battle with Mr. Diller in 1993 . Mr. Redstone , viewed by Hollywood a cocksure and uncouth , wanted to acquire Paramount to prove that he ’ d made it — that he belonged . That he wa more than his cable business of VH1 , Nickelodeon and MTV , a medium company that the real bigwig called “ The House That Beavis and Butt-Head Built . ”
 Mr. Diller also had emotional tie to Paramount ; he had run the studio from 1974 to 1984 , finding hit like “ Grease , ” “ Raiders of the Lost Ark ” and “ Beverly Hills Cop. ” But Mr. Diller had vision of using Paramount to push Hollywood into a new era : that a budding “ information superhighway ” called the internet might someday run through the studio , bringing movie and TV show directly to computer .
 In other word , Netflix .
 Mr. Redstone , who ended up acquiring Blockbuster ( yes , that Blockbuster ) to get the deal done , and his lawyer made fun of Mr. Diller ’ s interest in the internet . They ribbed him for bringing a computer — one of Apple ’ s early brick laptop — into the negotiating room . The joke , it turned out , wa on Mr. Redstone , whose Viacom would miss internet opportunity at nearly every turn over the next 25 year . Mr. Diller went on to found IAC , a thriving collection of web business .
 Other shortsighted decision by Mr. Redstone and his crony — rooted in hubris and old-fashioned greed — dragged Paramount down . Longtime entertainment executive likened the studio ’ s mismanagement under Mr. Grey and his bos , Philippe P. Dauman , who ran Viacom from 2006 to 2016 , to an old horror movie . Perhaps “ Invasion of the Body Snatchers . ”
 “ You have this aching sensation in your belly when you see the studio eating itself , ” said Jonathan L. Dolgen , chairman of Paramount in the 1990s .
 The real debacle started in 2005 . To fortify Paramount ’ s slate , the studio bought DreamWorks SKG , bringing Steven Spielberg , Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen into the fold . But the alliance quickly became a clash of personality . At one point , Mr. Dauman told investor that Mr. Spielberg — the most powerful director in Hollywood then and now — wa , in effect , “ completely immaterial ” to the company ’ s earnings . Mr. Geffen pried DreamWorks loose from Paramount and Viacom in 2008 .
 Then , in 2009 , a micro-budgeted horror movie called “ Paranormal Activity , ” produced by Jason Blum and released by Paramount , became a runaway hit , spawning a $ 1 billion franchise . Instead of anointing Mr. Blum , Mr. Grey wanted to control the series — and take the credit . So he kicked him off the Paramount lot . Mr. Blum went to Universal , where he ha printed money , churning out low-cost blockbuster like “ Get Out , ” “ The Purge , ” “ Halloween ” and “ Split ” through his Blumhouse Productions .
 The next year , Paramount allowed Disney to buy out it right to distribute Marvel superhero movie . The deal helped Viacom executive hit financial target that triggered bonus . Paramount , however , wa hobbled down the road ; Marvel became Disney ’ s most reliable hit machine .
 Theories began to spread about how Mr. Grey kept his job . Early in his tenure , he had intervened at a movie premiere party to defend Mr. Dauman from an obscenity-laced fusillade by the producer Harvey Weinstein . Back then , nobody stood up to Mr. Weinstein , and the move endeared Mr. Grey to the refined Mr. Dauman . But it had been a setup . Mr. Grey had planned the confrontation with Mr. Weinstein , whom he had been close to ever since their early career .
 Mr. Dauman , who wa fired in 2016 , received $ 72 million in exit payment . At the time , Paramount wa losing $ 450 million a year , and Viacom ’ s stock price had fallen 50 percent over two year .
 Mr. Dauman could not be reached for comment . For his part , Mr. Grey insisted until the end that he had done the best he could with Paramount . He wa proud that Mr. Dauman had allowed him to stick with a romantic notion of the film business — one that found a place for auteur-driven movie like “ Silence ” from Martin Scorsese and “ Allied ” by Robert Zemeckis — even a competing studio , adjusting to business reality , had shifted almost entirely toward fantasy tentpoles .
 Hollywood saw Paramount a failing to evolve . It wa almost a if Mr. Grey and certain cohort were playing out scene from “ Sunset Boulevard , ” which Paramount made in 1950 .
 “ I am big , ” the delusional silent film star Norma Desmond insists in one famous moment . “ It ’ s the picture that got small . ”
 Paramount ha endured boom and bust cycle before . In the 1960s the studio ’ s then-owner , the industrial conglomerate Gulf & Western , very nearly sold a badly struggling Paramount for it real estate value . Talks began with a cemetery that border the studio . More burial plot were envisioned .
 That wa when Paramount ’ s young production chief , Robert Evans , turned a macabre drama , “ Rosemary ’ s Baby , ” into a box office juggernaut . Another unexpected hit , the teary romance “ Love Story , ” arrived in 1970 .
 Mr. Evans went on to make the studio a showcase for culture-defining cinema , serving up “ The Godfather , ” “ The Godfather II , ” “ Harold and Maude , ” “ Serpico , ” “ Chinatown ” and “ Urban Cowboy , ” among others . Those movie inspired many of today ’ s top director and film executive to pursue Hollywood career — an entire generation of creativity reared on what Paramount produced .
 A successor , Sherry Lansing , kept Paramount healthy until handing over the rein to Mr. Grey . Her tenure wa marked by the Academy Award-winning hit “ Forrest Gump , ” “ Braveheart ” and “ Titanic , ” a co-production with Fox . The studio wa so strong , in fact , that people in Hollywood referred to it by a nickname : “ the Mountain , ” a reference to it logo of a snow-capped peak encircled by star .
 So anything is possible . In the month ahead , Paramount is betting big on drug , gay sex and rock ’ n ’ roll : “ Rocketman , ” a musical about Elton John ’ s turbulent life and career , arrives from the studio in May , one of Hollywood ’ s most competitive month . Mr. Gianopulos see another potential success in Ang Lee ’ s “ Gemini Man , ” which will roll out in the fall and star Will Smith a an aging hit man who must combat a clone of his younger self .
 Generally boding well , Mr. Gianopulos ha repaired crucial relationship with producer . Hasbro , a partner that had grown disenchanted , agreed to a five-year extension , for instance .
 David Ellison , a producer and billionaire financier of big-budget movie like “ Terminator Genisys , ” wa on the verge of leaving Paramount for another studio home base ; Mr. Gianopulos persuaded him to sign on with Paramount for four more year . That relationship ha once again grown tense , however , with Paramount unhappy about Mr. Ellison ’ s decision to hire John Lasseter , who wa forced to resign from Disney last year amid # MeToo allegation .
 Mr. Gianopulos in November made a deal with Netflix to supply the streaming service with a handful of original movie a year , opening up a new revenue stream .
 And Paramount finally ha the full support of Viacom , where a new chief executive , Robert M. Bakish , ha put into motion an aggressive turnaround plan . In an interview on the 52nd floor of Viacom ’ s Times Square headquarters , Mr. Bakish noted that he had just returned from Hollywood , where he met with agent , telling them that , unlike his predecessor , he ha no plan to offload Paramount . If anything , Viacom wa doubling down on the studio : We are open for business , so bring u your script .
 “ It wa clear we had a major problem , ” Mr. Bakish said . “ But it ’ s Paramount — it ’ s the Mountain . ”
 Movie insider want to believe that Paramount will respond to the heart paddle . But some people are privately sitting vigil .
 When we reached Mr. Diller on a business trip in Europe to talk about his failed bid for Paramount and what ha become of the studio and the movie business , his first reaction wa to ask why anyone would bother writing about the studio .
 “ Why Paramount ? ” he asked . “ It ’ s irrelevant . ”
 Because of an editing error , an earlier version of this article overstated what is known about the severance Brad Grey received when he left Paramount Pictures . A reference to his exit package ha been removed from the article .

 Good morning .
 ( Here ’ s the sign-up , if you don ’ t already get California Today by email . )
 Weekend 2 of Coachella start today . A Jewish rapper from Los Angeles will be putting on 10-minute pop-up Seders for those missing Passover with their family , and Kanye West will host his Easter Sunday Service . Festivalgoers will pose for photo with big art installation .
 But elsewhere in the desert , another art community is flourishing . And it ’ s got it own fest . My colleague Penelope Green , who cover home , garden and the built environment for the Style desk , wrote about it , and all the artist she met there :
 In late March , I spent three day at Bombay Beach , a place — population just over 300 — that would seem to be the least likely locale for such an extravaganza .
 Once a camping spot on a peninsula on the Salton Sea , a body of water careering toward ecological disaster , Bombay Beach wa popular in the middle of the last century , but flooding from agricultural runoff in the ’ 70 and ’ 80 swamped much of the area , and many people abandoned their vacation home and double-wides .
 For the next couple of decade , it wa a must-see for artist and others drawn to document it derelict property , and marvel at it weirdness . Suffice it to say that a lot of zombie movie and end-of-days video game were shot there .
 The festival is called , mischievously , the Bombay Beach Biennale . There were some well-known artist there , like Kenny Scharf and James Ostrer , but there were also some first-timers that I didn ’ t get the chance to include in my story , like Wil Kain , 51 , a self-taught artist who go by the nom de plume Dadaonysus .
 [ Read the full story exploring how much hip the desert can handle . ]
 In a shipping container on a dusty lot , he had set up what he called the Temple to the Scientific Method . At the back wa a triptych in the style of medieval religious painting . Ravishing and rendered with a wink , it depicted scientist a religious martyr . Mr. Kain had cast Copernicus a Christ , Hypatria of Alexandria — a fourth-century female philosopher and mathematician — a the Virgin of Guadalupe and Alan Turing a Joan of Arc . On an altar before them wa a portrait of Darwin .
 “ He wasn ’ t a martyr but he caused a lot of headache for others , ” said Mr. Kain .
 On the wall of the shipping container were more portrait of scientist along with a philosopher or two , chosen for their flaw a much a their contribution . There wa Edward Jenner , for instance , who pioneered the smallpox vaccine . “ He probably did more than anyone else for human history but he wa completely unethical , ” said Mr. Kain , noting that Jenner tested his vaccine on child , including his own son . “ We don ’ t do thing like that anymore . That ’ s the promise of science . That we can learn from our mistake and hopefully move forward . ”
 Mr. Kain said he had been homeless a a teenager , and spent much of his life a an outreach worker for people with mental health issue and other challenge .
 “ I ’ m on the autism spectrum , ” he said . “ And I suffer from PTSD . Art is a reflection of what I ’ m studying . I use it a therapy , to focus . It ’ s a discussion with myself . ”

 This week , Tejal Rao , The Times ’ s California restaurant critic , take u to yet another desert destination — this one culinary :
 Beyoncé ’ s two-hour-long documentary about her show Homecoming at last year ’ s Coachella dropped this week on Netflix , but that beautiful sprawl of desert east of Los Angeles wa already on my mind .
 I visited Flamingo Heights in Yucca Valley and reviewed La Copine , a small restaurant in a former diner on Highway 247 . Though outsider tend to pas through the area on their way to sound bath and camp site , the owner , Nikki Hill and Claire Wadsworth , decided to invest in the neighborhood and put down root , spending a little a possible on repair and renovation and moving into neighboring Landers .
 The result is a simple , seasonal hub not just for tourist but for the local community , a place for good fried chicken , big , hunky salad and can of beer on the patio overlooking the mountain .

 PERTH , Australia — Amélie Mauresmo won her two Grand Slam single title in 2006 and retired three year later . She had no idea that Roger Federer , the man who won Grand Slam single title on those same weekend a her in 2006 , would still be on top of his sport more than a decade later .
 “ I don ’ t know how he doe it , ” Mauresmo said . “ What it put on your body is huge . The training , the match , the travel , the jet lag , anything . ”
 Mauresmo and Federer won the Australian Open and Wimbledon single title in 2006 . Two year older than Federer , Mauresmo , 39 , retired from the sport in 2009 , at 30 , and is at the Australian Open a coach of the French player Lucas Pouille .
 Federer is at the Australian Open a the two-time defending champion . His bid for a 21st Grand Slam single championship begin Monday in Melbourne .
 “ Winning back-to-back Australian Opens like this , in my mid-30s , it ’ s one of my favorite thing I will look back on in my career , ” he said . “ I didn ’ t think it wa going to happen , and I had such a great time here in Australia the last couple of year and always enjoyed playing here . ”
 Federer acknowledges his age readily , quipping at the Hopman Cup recently that his 20-year-old opponent , Stefanos Tsitsipas , “ could be my son. ” And he marvel at his own ability to run up the score in the record book — 99 title and counting — at an age when many would count him out .
 But after an auspicious start to last season , when he won his first 17 match , Federer seemed to trail off . After winning the title in Rotterdam , the Netherlands , in February and briefly reclaiming the No . 1 ranking , Federer went without another tournament championship until October . After skipping the clay-court season for the second year in a row , he lost in the quarterfinal at Wimbledon after holding a match point against Kevin Anderson , and in the fourth round of the United States Open to John Millman .
 Federer played down the doomsday talk that accompanied his stagnation in the second half of the year .
 “ I wasn ’ t too disappointed , ” he said . “ I wa more surprised to hear that there wa sort of concern , or people were saying , ‘ What a bad second half to the year . ’ ”
 Federer conceded disappointing finish at the Grand Slam event but thought he otherwise played well , including a loss in a third-set tiebreaker to Novak Djokovic in the semifinal of the Paris Masters in November .
 He said what he needed to do better this year “ is really play well when it really come down to the crunch . ”
 Federer said he trusted his own evaluation of his play a well a input from his coach , Ivan Ljubicic and Severin Lüthi .
 “ I can analyze — with my age , very well — my own match and my own feeling , ” he said . “ I have two great coach , two of the best in the game , who give me their fair assessment , and I have a fitness coach who tell me if I ’ m moving good or not . They ’ re all open and honest towards me . I don ’ t want any sugarcoating ; I want it real , and straight . That ’ s it . I know , always , where I ’ m at .
 “ It ’ s very clear in my team where I stand . And from that standpoint , I ’ m happy where I am right now . I ’ m in a great position . ”
 Mauresmo longs to learn more about what Federer doe in his off-season .
 “ I hope one day he will explain to everyone everything , ” she said . “ The little detail , everything that he ’ s put together to be able to play this well at his age , to move this well . ”
 Federer is not exactly clandestine about his routine . He prefers , for example , to do his off-season movement drill on a tennis court , rather than indoors a many player do , to better simulate the footing and friction of match condition .
 “ I do a bit of weight , too , ” he said , grinning and gesturing toward his lithe frame . “ I know we don ’ t see it , but I do . ”
 Federer started his season auspiciously , winning all eight set he played at the Hopman Cup last week , never dropping serve in any of the match .
 But he considers the top-ranked Djokovic the clear favorite at the Australian Open . Djokovic , a six-time champion in Melbourne , ha won the last two Grand Slam tournament .
 “ We know who the usual are , ” said Federer , who is seeded third , “ and I ’ m part of that bunch . ”
 The longevity of that oligarchy , which also includes Rafael Nadal , ha blocked several younger player from breaking through on tennis ’ s biggest stage . No player currently younger than 30 ha won even a set in a Grand Slam final .
 “ We ’ re all tired of you guy already , but what can we do ? ” fourth-ranked Alexander Zverev , 21 , said during the trophy ceremony of the Hopman Cup on Saturday , when he lost to Federer in single and mixed double .
 “ Especially you , ” he added , turning around and looking at Federer , who laughed . “ I mean , you ’ re 30-whatever ! Why ? Just , why ? Let u have one . ”

 Once , it wa easy to be obscure . Technology ha ended that .
 By Woodrow Hartzog and Evan Selinger
 Dr. Hartzog is a professor of law and computer science . Dr. Selinger is a professor of philosophy .
 We are constantly exposed in public . Yet most of our action will fade into obscurity . Do you , for example , remember the face of stranger who stood in line with you the last time you bought medicine at a drugstore ? Probably not . Thanks to limited memory and norm against staring , they probably don ’ t remember yours either .
 This is what it mean to be obscure . And our failure to collectively value this idea show where we ’ ve gone wrong in the debate over data and surveillance .
 Lawmakers and industry leader are missing the big picture . They are stuck on traditional concept like “ transparency , ” “ consent ” and “ secrecy , ” which lead to proposal that reinforce broken mechanism like consenting to unreadable term of service . They are operating under the dangerous illusion that there ’ s a clear distinction between what ’ s public and what ’ s private . Most people probably intuitively know that their most deeply held secret are private while the thing about them that are commonly known or widely broadcast are not . But what about information about our everyday action that is shared with some but not all ?
 Obscurity bridge this privacy gap with the idea that the part of our life that are hard or unlikely to be found or understood are relatively safe . It is a combination of the privacy you have in public and the privacy you have in group . Obscurity is a barrier that can shield you from government , corporate and social snoop . And until lawmaker , corporate leader and citizen embrace obscurity and move to protect it , your freedom and opportunity to flourish will be in jeopardy .
 The concept wa first meaningfully articulated in a landmark 1989 Supreme Court decision , Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press , which recognized a privacy interest in the “ practical obscurity ” of information that wa technically available to the public but could be found only by spending an unrealistic amount of time and effort . After the concept wa introduced , most lawmaker , judge and the tech industry promptly forgot about it . This ha dulled the potential of obscurity a a rallying point for change and leaf society struggling to protect something in dire need of defining and defending .
 Understanding obscurity mean paying attention to how space , time and people ’ s cognitive limitation make it difficult for others to surveil u or find out thing about u .
 Consider space . The further away people are , the harder it is to see with the naked eye who they are and where they ’ re going . Usually , we are visible only to those nearby . But cellphone location data can reveal that same highly personal information to anyone with mean and motivation . We should be disturbed that apps often collect location data simply because they can and that T-Mobile , Sprint and AT & T reportedly have illegally sold customer ’ 911 location data to third party . And we should be pleased that the Supreme Court ruled last year in Carpenter vs. United States that , under the Fourth Amendment , cellphone record can ’ t be seized without a warrant .
 Consider time . Memories fade a time pass . But the internet ha impeccable recall . That ’ s why we should applaud the senator who have proposed a bipartisan update to the Children ’ s Online Privacy Protection Act that would give parent and child an “ eraser button ” to remove a child ’ s data from platform like Google and Facebook .
 It ’ s also why we should be skeptical of Mark Zuckerberg ’ s announcement that Facebook will become a more “ privacy-focused platform ” that emphasizes feature like ephemeral , expiring information . Truly ephemeral communication are certainly obscure , but it ’ s unclear what information Facebook will scrub on the front end ( for user ) and the back end ( from the company ) . The company ’ s history suggests we shouldn ’ t let our guard down .
 Obscurity is also a better way to understand Europe ’ s “ right to be forgotten ” law , which can ’ t make anyone forget anything , but can make the remnant of your awkward youth harder to find online .
 Finally , consider cognitive limitation . Facial recognition technology pose an immense danger to society because it can be used to overcome biological constraint on how many individual anyone can recognize in real time . If it use continues to grow and the right regulation aren ’ t instituted , we might lose the ability to go out in public without being recognized by the police , our neighbor and corporation .
 Creating strong regulation for the technology is going to be an uphill battle , especially because it ’ s already become widespread , being deployed at airport to make boarding easier and adopted by school to increase safety . It is even being used at summer camp so parent can automatically receive photo in which their child appear .
 Threats to our obscurity are growing because technology is making our personal information easy and cheap to aggregate , archive and interpret — with substantial growth in predictive analytics , too . To see what we mean , just look yourself up on the website MyLife and marvel at how much information ha been cobbled together from different moment in your life for anyone to see at the click of a button . Even speaking in hushed tone to a friend at a crowded cafe might not be enough to protect your obscurity if camera are someday equipped with lip-reading artificial intelligence software .
 Obscurity is vital to our well-being for several reason . It give u breathing room to go about our daily routine with little fear of being judged , sent unwanted ad , gossiped about or needlessly shamed .
 [ As technology advance , will it continue to blur the line between public and private ? Sign up for Charlie Warzel ’ s limited-run newsletter to explore what ’ s at stake and what you can do about it . ]
 Obscurity make meaningful and intimate relationship possible , one that offer solidarity , loyalty and love . It allows u to choose with whom we want to share different kind of information . It protects u from having everyone know the different role we play in the different part of our life . We need to be able to play one role with our co-worker while revealing other part of ourselves with friend and family . Indeed , obscurity is one reason we feel safe bonding with others over our shared vulnerability , our mutual hope , dream and fear .
 Obscurity enables u to develop and grow a individual . It provides u collectively with space to explore new and controversial possibility , to transgress taboo and ignore arbitrary rule . You might have thought you could skip church without anyone knowing , but church are being marketed facial recognition system that will make sure your absence are duly noted . It won ’ t stop there .
 Obscurity protects u from being pressured to be conventional . This buffer from a ubiquitous permanent record is especially important for the exploratory phase of youth . To develop a human , people must be free to try thing they might later regret . This is how we become better people . Without obscurity , we wouldn ’ t have the freedom to take risk , fail and dust ourselves off . We ’ d be stymied by the fear of being deemed failure by a system that never forgets .
 Finally , obscurity is crucial to democracy . Obscurity foster civic participation and give u the confidence to attend political protest and engage in political speech online without worrying about ending up on a government watch list . It ’ s why the American Civil Liberties Union worry about the government monitoring social medium .
 Things can be private even if others can see them . And there is so much of our life that industry and government have yet to find . But in our status-obsessed culture , it can be hard to appreciate that the opposite of obscurity isn ’ t fame , but chillingly oppressive fear .

 SAN FRANCISCO — For Rick Heitzmann , a venture capitalist at FirstMark Capital , the moment is now .
 Two company that FirstMark invested in year ago , Pinterest and Postmates , have filed paperwork to go public . Pinterest unveiled an offering prospectus on Friday . A third company , Airbnb , is expected to do the same within the next year . All are likely to be embraced by Wall Street , generating huge profit for FirstMark .
 Which mean it ’ s time for Mr. Heitzmann , whose New York investment firm ha kept a relatively low profile , to consider hiring a public relation agency .
 The flood of initial public offering is an occasion for FirstMark to “ tell our story , ” he said . “ We have been part of some of the more successful start-ups in the last several year and have been instrumental to their growth , often a the first investor . That ’ s a good story to tell . ”
 Across tech land , investor who helped nurture “ unicorn , ” the start-ups valued at more than $ 1 billion , are now getting ready to embody a different animal metaphor : the peacock .
 That ’ s because the company they bet on year ago — such a Uber , Lyft , Pinterest , Slack , Postmates and Peloton — are preparing to list on the stock market , which would create a bonanza of return , the like of which Silicon Valley hasn ’ t seen for year .
 For venture capitalist , that mean it is time to stop walking a tightrope of self-promotion . For year , many did not want to look a if they were taking credit for the success of the start-ups they backed . And they did not want to make it seem that the truckloads of money they stood to make were more important than their start-ups ’ high-minded mission .
 So they sent fawning congratulatory tweet , posted generic blog post to Medium and name-dropped their deal on one of a dozen interchangeable V.C . podcasts . They “ thought led ” and became “ thinkfluencers . ”
 Now that they ’ re ready to shed the false modesty , some investor are calling in the pro .
 Ann Miura-Ko , a partner at the venture capital firm Floodgate , recently worked with the public relation firm OutCast to spotlight her “ special relationship ” with the ride-hailing company Lyft . Ms. Miura-Ko invested in Lyft in 2010 , when it wa called Zimride , and her firm owns about 1.5 million share in the company . That stake could be worth a much a $ 102 million when Lyft go public , which could happen this week .
 Ms. Miura-Ko said Lyft ’ s I.P.O . would validate Floodgate ’ s strategy of investing in company when they are just starting , before the bigger venture firm get involved .
 “ We ’ ve had great exit along the way , but this is the real proof point , ” she said . “ We think it ’ s important to Floodgate ’ s story . ”
 When asked about hiring a public relation firm , Ms. Miura-Ko deflected . Later , she said , “ Every person ha their own way of developing a megaphone . ”
 In a follow-up statement , she added , “ I ’ m a teacher and an investor , I have a Ph.D. in math modeling , and I think like an engineer , so thinking about myself and my business from a branding and marketing perspective doesn ’ t come naturally to me , but these are important factor in the success of all kind of business all over the world , which is why I engaged OutCast to help me think through and formalize both the Floodgate brand and my professional brand . ”
 OutCast declined to comment .
 In Silicon Valley , some public relation firm said they had noticed more query from venture capitalist in the last month . Mike Moeller , founder of Aircover Communications , a public relation firm , said it had been busier than normal with cold call from venture firm that were trying to stand out .
 “ Some firm are realizing , ‘ Huh , maybe awareness doesn ’ t just magically grow on tree , ’ ” he said .
 “ They ’ re realizing they need to be part of this conversation , ” added John Kuch , a public relation executive at Moxie Communications Group . With so much money in tech , “ folk who have been conservative are getting out there even more . ”
 For year , venture capitalist on Sand Hill Road , the epicenter of the venture industry in Menlo Park , Calif. , were a more buttoned-up lot . Few used public relation firm . Many investor looked askance at talking to the press .
 But that changed a venture capital increasingly became a reputation game . Venture firm such a Andreessen Horowitz , which wa co-founded by the Netscape wunderkind Marc Andreessen , hired their own public relation staff .
 Some venture firm built out entire medium division . First Round Capital , for example , created a digital magazine , First Round Review , which publishes entrepreneurial profile , advice and lesson . Other investor have found time between start-up pitch and board meeting to publish book , deliver TED talk and amass huge following on Twitter .
 Still , nothing crown them a much a being associated with a unicorn company that go public . When Facebook went public in 2012 , venture capitalist who had invested in the social network solidified their reputation a rainmaker — and also were set for life . They included Jim Breyer of Accel Partners , David Sze of Greylock Partners and Peter Thiel of Founders Fund .
 “ A $ 9 Billion Jackpot for Facebook Investor , ” one headline screamed about Mr. Breyer in 2012 , marveling at how he had turned a $ 12.7 million investment in the social network into a pile of gold .
 That kind of name recognition give investor an edge over competition in new deal . Promotion is part of the game , said Lisa Wu , a partner at Norwest Venture Partners . “ If you don ’ t do it , you miss out , ” she said .
 Trevor O ’ Brien , who is working on a start-up in San Francisco , said entrepreneur also looked at whether a venture capitalist had invested in any unicorn .
 “ V.C.s showcasing logo from big investment doe matter in term of signaling credibility and experience , ” he said , adding that while it is not the only factor , “ it check a box . ”
 Alongside Ms. Miura-Ko and Mr. Heitzmann , this wave of I.P.O.s will likely raise the profile of Jeff Jordan , a partner at Andreessen Horowitz who backed Airbnb and Pinterest , and Alfred Lin , a venture capitalist at Sequoia Capital who invested in Airbnb .
 Mr. Heitzmann said FirstMark wa not embarking on a promotion effort because of trouble raising new fund or getting into good deal . Instead , founder of younger company that FirstMark ha invested in have suggested he try to raise the firm ’ s profile for their sake .
 “ Portfolio company have said , ‘ If you guy had a better brand , it would help me recruit , ’ ” he said .
 Ms. Miura-Ko said she didn ’ t do any personal branding when Floodgate started in 2010 because there wasn ’ t much competition to invest in the very young company that the firm wa targeting .
 “ You didn ’ t have to think about it , ” she said .
 But now it ’ s a lot noisier . Ms. Miura-Ko wa recently told by student at Stanford University , where she teach class about start-ups , that to stand out , she should create her own channel on Discord , a chat app for gamers . She wa amused by the suggestion but didn ’ t follow it , she said . Why ? Because it didn ’ t feel authentic to her personal brand .

 The testing expert , Mark Riddell , traveled across the country to take ACT and SAT exam for the child of the rich and famous , federal prosecutor said . He wa so good at them that he could calibrate a test score on demand , earning more than $ 200,000 doing it .
 One mother wa so thrilled with Mr. Riddell ’ s service , after he flew to California to help rig an exam for her daughter , that she celebrated with him and her daughter in a car on the way home , prosecutor said . The daughter ended up at Georgetown University .
 Mr. Riddell , 36 , appeared in Boston federal court on Friday to plead guilty to charge in the college admission scandal that ha swept up celebrity , business leader and college athletic coach . Prosecutors said he wa a key part of the scheme .
 His plea followed agreement by 13 parent , including the actress Felicity Huffman , to plead guilty to bribery and other form of fraud . They are accused of paying off college official and arranging for fake test score to get their child into elite university .
 “ At time , the student were in on it , ” Eric S. Rosen , a federal prosecutor in the case , said on Friday .
 Mr. Riddell wa impassive and nodded occasionally a the prosecutor recounted the allegation . Wearing a black scarf , slim-fitting navy suit and tortoiseshell glass , he said little and answered , “ I do , your honor , ” when the judge , Nathaniel M. Gorton , asked if he understood the charge .
 As part of his plea deal , the government will recommend the low end of a sentencing range between 33 to 41 month in prison on July 18 . Mr. Riddell wa released on $ 50,000 bond .
 In the wake of the federal investigation , the college testing industry is now scrambling to fix weakness that the scheme ha exposed , focusing on the special-needs arrangement that allowed Mr. Riddell to do his work .
 “ The scheme took advantage of our effort to accommodate student with disability , ” said Peter Schwartz , chief risk officer and general counsel for the College Board , which administers the SAT . “ We ’ ve never seen somebody try to weaponize that or turn that to their advantage to beat our security system . So that ’ s new , and we ’ re addressing that specifically . ”
 Officials at the College Board said student who needed double the time or more to take the test would now be required to take it at their home school , with rare exception .
 According to court paper in the admission case , the mastermind of the cheating scandal , William Singer , knew that if student were able to double their testing time by claiming they had a disability , they could also request testing site of their choice , sometimes thousand of mile away , where Mr. Singer would arrange for cheating .
 The College Board said it wa now cracking down on such site arrangement . Any case in which student request to take test at school other than their own “ will require verifiable justification and implement additional enhanced security process , ” Jerome White , a spokesman for the testing company , said .
 Guidelines for those exception were still being developed , Mr. White said .
 [ Read : Is the college cheating scandal the “ final straw ” for standardized test ? ]
 But the College Board said on Friday that it did not plan to change how it grant extra-time accommodation , and defended it process a “ thoughtful and balanced. ” Most student who receive special allowance for test at school “ automatically ” get them for standardized test a well , the company said , although it doe employ it own clinician who may review and overrule request in a small number of case .
 The company played down the significance of the admission scandal for the testing industry . Officials said it had involved a tiny number of cheating allegation over eight year , compared with the million of SAT test taken over the same time . Similarly , they said , the case pointed to two corrupt proctor out of ten of thousand around the world .
 “ Let ’ s be honest , this is not a kid looking over their shoulder at another kid ’ s answer sheet , ” Mr. Schwartz said . “ You ’ ve got to get a grown-up to jeopardize their job , their future and their freedom , because these are crime that somebody ’ s going to jail for . That is really hard and really rare . ”
 In the admission scheme , prosecutor say that Mr. Singer would advise wealthy client to have their child certified a learning disabled , and ask for 100 percent extended time to take the SAT or the ACT .
 Mr. Singer would then arrange session at one of two testing center , a public high school in Houston , or a private college preparatory school in West Hollywood , Calif. , where prosecutor say he bribed test administrator and enlisted Mr. Riddell ’ s service . He told parent to make up a reason their child had to travel so far , perhaps a wedding or a bar mitzvah .
 With the collusion of test administrator , Mr. Riddell could secretly take the test or correct answer on the test . Prosecutors say he wa typically paid $ 10,000 per test .

 The College Board ’ s change to it travel allowance came a testing company were strengthening security measure , even before the scandal broke . The College Board ban cellphone during testing and ha increased random audit of test center . In some place , test are delivered in locked box that can not be opened until test time .
 The company ha also been experimenting with scrambling the order of question and answer sheet , so that a student can not rely on copying the answer on a neighboring sheet . Students may also be given different part of the test at different time .
 But the aspect of testing that the scandal ha perhaps drawn the most scrutiny to are special accommodation .
 Testing company must follow federal guideline under the Americans With Disabilities Act . The Department of Justice , under President Barack Obama , issued guidance to testing company in 2015 encouraging them to defer to documentation from qualified professional attesting to a student ’ s learning disability , even if the student had not been granted formal testing accommodation by his or her school .
 Assessments from private psychologist were how many of the student in the admission case were able to secure their special testing condition . Some admission expert and high school guidance counselor said they had noticed more student , typically from highly educated family , using such assessment .
 The number of student who take the SAT with special accommodation fluctuates , but is generally about 4 percent of the total pool , according to the College Board .
 Ed Colby , a spokesman for ACT , the company that administers the test of the same name , said that in recent year about 5 percent of test taker were granted extended time .
 Mr. Colby said the company wa reviewing it procedure “ in an effort to improve the security of the ACT test , ” but he declined to offer specific . The company us more than 5,000 test center across the country , he said , and ha had to shut down some with documented abuse — an occurrence he called “ very rare . ”
 The court paper in the admission case describe how Mr. Riddell engineered a huge jump in the test score of at least one student , and prosecutor marveled at his ability to calibrate test score .
 But College Board official said Mr. Riddell ’ s skill wa not that special and in fact demonstrated a positive side of the test . They said that a large score gain alone would not prompt a review for cheating , and that the company actively encouraged such jump through it online test-prep service .
 “ What he demonstrates is that you don ’ t have to beat this test , ” Mr. Schwartz said . “ You can take it , you can study for it , you can get good at it . There are many , many people — legitimate , honest people — who work hard to prepare for it . ”

 ANGOULÊME , France — It ’ s a big year for comic book anniversary . Batman ’ s 80th is this year , and Asterix is turning 60 . But at the Angoulême International Comics Festival in France , which finished on Sunday , there wa a sense that the form ’ s best day may be yet to come — in the French-speaking world , at least .
 “ It ’ s a kind of golden age , ” said Jean-Luc Fromental , a comic book author who also run a graphic-novel imprint for the publisher Denoël . “ There ha never been so much talent . There have never been so many interesting book published . ”
 There are now more comic book published annually in France and Belgium than ever before , according to the festival ’ s artistic director , Stéphane Beaujean . “ The market ha risen from 700 book per year in the 1990s to 5,000 this year , ” he said in an interview . “ I don ’ t know any cultural industry which ha had that kind of increase . ”
 Research by the market research company GfK , released to coincide with the festival , showed that turnover in the comic book industry in those two country alone reached 510 million euro , or around $ 580 million , in 2018 .
 The bumper year in France and Belgium contrast with a mixed situation worldwide . Comichron , a website that report on comic book sale in the United States , where the market is worth around $ 1 billion , say that sale there are declining .
 But in term of respect and recognition , comic are on the way up . In July , “ Sabrina , ” by the American artist Nick Drnaso , became the first graphic novel to be nominated for the Man Booker Prize , Britain ’ s most prestigious literary award . “ March : Book Three , ” a graphic novel about the civil right movement , won the National Book Award for Young People ’ s Literature in 2016 .
 In Angoulême , a city about 450 kilometer , or 280 mile , southwest of Paris , comic book aren ’ t merely an annual preoccupation . Visitors arriving by train are greeted outside the station by an obelisk honoring René Goscinny , one of the creator of Asterix . There ’ s a comic museum , and a comic library .
 The festival , spread out in venue across the city , featured comic book on just about every conceivable subject — the life of Jules Verne , the wine of Burgundy , erotic story set in space , even one whose main character is a gym sock . The St.-Martial church wa repurposed a a shop specializing in comic book title for Christian reader , whether modern spiritual tale or retellings of Bible story .
 The Angoulême event is unusual in it embrace of comic from around the world , including , but not limited to , those from the three tradition that dominate the form here : French-Belgian , American and Japanese manga . “ It ’ s the only place in the world where you can see all the comic created in the world , ” said Beaujean , who this year ha doubled the size of an area where publisher can buy right to international title .
 Books featuring classic character like Donald Duck , Wonder Woman and Tintin were available in both freshly-printed form and a secondhand rarity . And while occasional encounter with men in superhero outfit are unavoidable at an event like this , Angoulême ha a very different atmosphere from it American counterpart such a Comic-Con .
 “ In America , it ’ s about the pop culture , which would include everything from Marvel movie to Lego , ” said the American comic book artist Terry Moore , the author of a 26-year-old series , “ Strangers in Paradise. ” “ In France , I ’ m seeing that it ’ s about book , book , book , ” he said .
 On Saturday , France ’ s culture minister , Franck Riester , gave a speech comparing the event ’ s role in the world of comic to that of the Cannes Film Festival in cinema , and Jean-Michel Blanquer , the education minister , visited on Thursday . The attendance by government official underscored the way the “ ninth art , ” a comic book are sometimes referred to in France , is not a niche pursuit but a mainstream activity .
 The Angoulême festival announces a number of prize each year , their recipient chosen by fellow comic artist . This year , for the first time , woman won both of the festival ’ s biggest award . A jury of seven artist selected the debut graphic novel by the American author Emil Ferris , “ My Favorite Thing Is Monsters , ” a winner of the Fauve d ’ Or , or Golden Wildcat award , for the year ’ s best book .
 The Japanese Manga artist Rumiko Takahashi won the Grand Prix , the festival ’ s lifetime achievement award . Takahashi began publishing manga comic in 1978 and her book , including “ Inuyasha , ” about a time-traveling schoolgirl , have sold more than 200 million copy . She is only the second woman to win the prize .
 Angoulême is a cornerstone of the comic industry in France and Belgium , but some in the field say the exuberant headline conceal a more complex picture . A common refrain is that the huge increase in title ha meant that , while there ’ s more money in the industry , there are also a greater number of author grasping for a share of it .
 Benoît Peeters , an author of comic book who ha also written a biography of the philosopher Jacques Derrida , said in an interview that despite the increase in overall readership , “ the sale of each book , except for those like Asterix and manga , are going down . ”
 Peeters founded an organization called The General State of Comics to lobby publisher and the French government to defend the interest of comic book artist .
 He said that publisher were hedging their bet by signing up for too many book , with smaller title often receiving inadequate support a a result . “ I think the publisher need to make some choice , ” he said . “ When they choose a book they have to defend it and promote it . ”
 But in France , at least , comic book were taken seriously a an art form , Peeters said . “ When I wa a young author I came from a more literary world , ” he said . “ People said , ‘ What are you doing with comic ? You are a clever person . You should work with movie or literature. ’ Now , nobody would say that . ”

 Islanders goalie Robin Lehner heard his name chanted loudly at Nassau Coliseum in the closing minute of Sunday ’ s 3-0 win over the Anaheim Ducks , another sterling performance in a renaissance season for him and his team . He clapped in appreciation and smiled toward the sellout crowd .
 Ten month ago he had reached rock-bottom . As he wrote in an essay for The Athletic in September , Lehner wa drinking a case of beer a day and taking pill to sleep . He thought about suicide . Then in March he had a panic attack during a game with the Buffalo Sabres . Soon he entered the league ’ s substance abuse recovery program and received a diagnosis of bipolar disorder with manic episode .
 Now , he is 10 month sober and an integral part of the Islanders ’ stunning turnaround under their new coach , Barry Trotz .
 Lehner , 27 , is 11-1-1 mark since mid-December and entered Wednesday ’ s game leading the league in goals-against average ( 2.02 ) and save percentage ( .931 ) .
 Last year the Islanders allowed a league-worst 293 goal . Behind their goalie Lehner and Thomas Greiss and Trotz ’ s defense-oriented game plan , the team ha reversed course , winning 15 of it last 19 game heading into the All-Star break this weekend . They are in first place in the Metropolitan Division , a position few pundit thought even remotely possible before the season .
 “ We started off the year with a belief in a new coach and new system and I think everyone ha bought in , ” said Lehner , who is 15-7-4 with three shutout , already surpassing his victory total with the Sabres last season . “ When you come to work with purpose every day and everyone buy in every day , it get the focus going . ”
 Since last March Lehner ha worked to resuscitate his personal life and on-ice livelihood . Admitting he had never had a sober season during his hockey career , he focus daily to control his addiction .
 “ I ’ m an alcoholic and I have a few other thing , but it ’ s treatable , ” said Lehner , who wa also found to have A.D.H.D . and post-traumatic stress disorder . “ I wa in a very dark place . I didn ’ t see much in the future at one point . Now I feel good . I ’ m coming along . ”
 Lehner , whose father wa a goaltending teacher for the Rangers star Henrik Lundqvist in Sweden , played part of five season with the Ottawa Senators before tending goal for the next three year in Buffalo .
 Islanders General Manager Lou Lamoriello signed Lehner to a one-year contract in July and paired him with Greiss under Trotz and the goaltending guru Mitch Korn and Piero Greco .
 “ I knew about the ability and talent he had and thing for whatever reason went in the wrong direction , ” Lamoriello said during training camp . “ I just called — I knew the agency that he is with — and I said , ‘ why don ’ t you come in and let ’ s have a conversation. ’ It wa something we felt very comfortable with . ”
 The Islanders have emerged a a surprising story line after the departure via free agency of their former superstar captain John Tavares to the Toronto Maple Leafs . Fans were furious over Tavares ’ s exit and seemed resigned to a rebuilding season . But the team ’ s defense ha forged a fresh confidence under Trotz , allowing a league-low 118 goal through 49 game .
 The offense ha flourished with steady production from all corner . Eight Islanders have scored at least 11 goal , the first time since the 1984-85 season that the team ha generated such a balanced attack at this juncture of the season .
 Lehner emphasized that success is a byproduct of the team ’ s cohesiveness . Players and their family live in proximity of one another , the team ’ s practice home in East Meadow , and Nassau Coliseum , where they are playing half their home game this season .
 Lehner said he detected a positive environment with his new squad even before moving to Long Island to train with his teammate over the summer .
 “ I hadn ’ t played with anyone on this team before , but a soon a I signed , I think the whole team sent me a text message , ” said Lehner , who ha a young son and daughter with his wife , Donya .
 Cal Clutterbuck , an Islander since 2013 , ha marveled at Lehner ’ s focus and dedication from the start of their relationship on the ice .
 “ You know you can ’ t go through something like that alone , and he ’ s got a nice support system here , ” Clutterbuck said . “ He ’ s living his life the right way and getting rewarded for it . ”
 Trotz , who also heard his name chanted Sunday a the Islanders won for the fifth time in seven game back at their raucous former home , said Lehner ’ s achievement in tandem with Greiss are a boon for the team ’ s psyche .
 “ He know how important he is , ” said Trotz , who joined the Islanders after winning the Stanley Cup with the Washington Capitals last season . “ He and Greisser have been exceptional . When you feel that you ’ re part of the success and part of the reason you ’ re having success , it ’ s got to feel good . ”
 Amid the relentless swirl of the season , Lehner said he had not fully absorbed what his turnaround might mean for those encountering similar life battle . He is more focused on managing his crease and being a husband and father .
 “ I still have a lot of email and letter to go through , ” he said . “ It ’ s not about being an inspiration figure . It ’ s about shining a light . If you have these problem , it ’ s treatable . You need to get help . You need to find support . You can ’ t do it alone . That ’ s all the message there is . ”
 And Clutterbuck said Lehner ’ s revival ha inspired him and by extension , the entire team .
 “ He ’ s had a glimmer in his eye all season , ” Clutterbuck said . “ We are rooting for his success , all pulling for Robin a a person . I couldn ’ t be happier for him . ”

 A nurse at a Phoenix nursing home who had been assigned to care for a woman in a vegetative state who wa raped and later gave birth to a child wa charged on Wednesday with sexual assault , the police said .
 Detectives at the Phoenix Police Department took the nurse , Nathan Sutherland , 36 , in for questioning in the case on Tuesday , the police said , and collected a DNA sample from him that matched that of the child , a boy who wa born on Dec. 29 . Mr. Sutherland wa booked on Wednesday morning at the Maricopa County Jail on one charge of sexual assault and one charge of vulnerable adult abuse , the police said .
 “ Through a combination of good old-fashioned police work , combing through evidence , talking to people and following up on information , combined with the marvel of DNA technology , we were able to identify and develop probable cause to arrest a suspect , ” Jeri L. Williams , the Police Department ’ s chief , said at a news conference on Wednesday .
 Detectives started to focus on Mr. Sutherland because he wa among the medical staff member at the nursing home , Hacienda HealthCare , who were assigned to care for the woman around the time last year that the police believe she wa assaulted . The woman had been at the nursing home since 1992 and since then had been in the same condition , unable to communicate or move , according to medical record . A lawyer for the family on Wednesday said they were aware of the arrest but had no comment .
 Mr. Sutherland , a licensed practical nurse , had worked at Hacienda since 2012 and wa assigned to a unit treating intellectually disabled people since 2014 , the company said in a statement on Wednesday . He wa fired immediately after the company learned of his arrest , the statement said . It added that Mr. Sutherland had worked his last shift on Sunday .
 Earlier on Wednesday , the police said Mr. Sutherland had been employed by the company since 2011 .
 On Wednesday , Mr. Sutherland appeared at the Superior Court of Arizona and his bond wa set at $ 500,000 , said Bryan Bouchard , a spokesman for the court .
 Mr. Sutherland ’ s lawyer , David W. Gregan , could not immediately be reached for comment .
 For nearly a month , the detail of the case had gripped the Phoenix region and embroiled Hacienda HealthCare , a major health provider for people with serious disability in the state , in scandal a Chief Williams made the case the department ’ s top investigative concern . The fallout ha been immense at Hacienda , forcing the company ’ s longtime chief executive to resign , and made it the focus of multiple investigation .
 “ Every member of the Hacienda organization is troubled beyond word to think that a licensed practical nurse could be capable of seriously harming a patient , ” company official said in a statement . “ Once again , we offer an apology and send our deepest sympathy to the client and her family , to the community and to our agency partner at every level . ”
 Mr. Sutherland had “ undergone an extensive background check upon hiring , ” the company said . That included searching possible criminal history and sex offender registry , a well a checking his personal reference and performing a drug screening , the company said in a statement . They added that his nursing license wa “ current and in good standing . ”
 The company recently announced it had hired Rick Romley , the former longtime top prosecutor in Maricopa County , to conduct an internal review of the assault and how it could have gone unnoticed .
 Since it founding in late 1970s , Hacienda HealthCare ha grown into one of the largest private provider of care in Arizona for people with serious cognitive and physical disability , operating mostly out of a single campus about six mile south of downtown Phoenix . It run more than 40 program through it subsidiary , which provide service to more than 2,000 people every year , according to the company .
 While Hacienda is a private company , some of it operation receive public funding , including $ 230 million in Medicaid funding since 2010 , state record show .
 As part of the investigation , detective started to take DNA sample from all male employee at Hacienda earlier this month . Sgt . Tommy Thompson , a Phoenix police spokesman , said that Mr. Sutherland offered a DNA sample only after he wa shown a court order to do so and that he invoked his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination when he wa arrested .
 Mr. Sutherland ’ s DNA sample , taken Tuesday , wa “ checked , rechecked , triple-checked , quadruple-checked ” by the department ’ s crime laboratory before Mr. Sutherland wa arrested , Sergeant Thompson said .
 Two doctor who treated patient at Hacienda , including the woman at the center of the case , no longer work at the nursing home . Last week , the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System , which manages the state ’ s Medicaid program , notified one of the doctor , Thanh Nguyen , that he had been suspended and could not work at Hacienda or any other Medicaid-supported facility in the state .
 The state accused Dr. Nguyen of placing “ the health and welfare of A.H.C.C.C.S . member in danger , ” according to a letter from the state obtained by The New York Times . The suspension applies only to work with Medicaid-supported center in the state .
 State record show that he also operates a medical consultant group that ha a contract with the Arizona Department of Veterans ’ Services to treat veteran and their family .

 MELBOURNE , Australia — Ann Chisholm contemplated traveling from her Minnesota home to watch the main-draw debut of her cousin Danielle Collins at the Australian Open , but it seemed like a flight of fancy . Collins had lost in the first round of the three major she played last year , and it made little sense for a relative to travel 10,000 mile to see what might be only one match .
 But Chisholm continued monitoring airfare after each of Collins ’ s first three match in Melbourne , all victory . Then , in the fourth round , the unseeded Collins defeated Angelique Kerber , the 2016 champion and this year ’ s No . 2 seed .
 It wa just past 11 on Saturday night in Grand Rapids , Minn. , when Collins sealed the upset , and Chisholm ’ s inner voice , which had been nagging her for a week to hop on a plane , grew so loud she could hardly sleep .
 On Sunday morning , Chisholm reached out to Collins and said she wa looking at flight to Australia . Chisholm didn ’ t want her arrival to surprise Collins in case , she said , it “ messed up her mojo . ”
 After Collins reacted enthusiastically , Chisholm , who ha four child , asked her husband and her mother if they would watch over thing at home if she went away for a few day . Then she called a Delta Air Lines reservation agent , who pieced together a trip from Minneapolis to San Diego , then on to Los Angeles that would deliver her to Melbourne on Tuesday morning .
 Chisholm had about five minute to pack for her journey to the Southern Hemisphere , not enough time to retrieve summer clothes from storage . So she threw some shirt and pant into a suitcase , and when her family left for church , she left for Australia .
 The trip went off without a hitch , and a few hour after landing here in Melbourne , Chisholm wa in Collins ’ s player box at Rod Laver Arena , transmitting positive vibe down to the court during Collins ’ s 2-6 , 7-5 , 6-1 win over Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova .
 With the victory , Collins , 25 , earned a semifinal meeting against Petra Kvitova , the eighth seed and a two-time Wimbledon champion , who recently beat Collins in three set in the first round of a tuneup event in Brisbane .
 “ I feel like I ’ m representing the whole family , ” Chisholm said .
 In St. Petersburg , Fla. , Cathy Collins , a preschool teacher , managed a few hour ’ sleep before her alarm went off a little after midnight , in time for her to watch television coverage of her daughter ’ s match . Collins ’ s father , Walter , a landscaper , waited until after the match to sleep , taking what amounted to a power nap before starting work .
 The house where her parent live is the only place Collins ha called home . Some of the neighbor have known her since she wa born . A couple that life across the street ha been running over to celebrate every win with Collins ’ s parent .
 “ When the doorbell ring in the middle of the night , we know who it is , ” Cathy Collins said by telephone .
 It wa a quarter to 8 on Tuesday morning , and Collins ’ s mother would soon be corralling more than a dozen preschooler . She had gone back to bed when her daughter ’ s match wa over , and woke up wondering if the victory had been a Technicolor dream .
 “ It ’ s weird , ” Cathy Collins said . “ It ’ s like , ‘ Is my daughter really in the semifinal ? ’ ”
 On the other side of the world , Collins described her father a “ the hardest worker I know ” and marveled at her mother ’ s stamen .
 “ I don ’ t know how my mom is managing , ” Collins said . “ She ’ s not getting more than four or five hour of sleep on these match night , and she ’ s dealing with 15 3-year-olds . She ’ s a trooper . ”
 So is Collins , who wa ranked 35th in the world coming into this tournament with an 0-5 record in Grand Slam match . She seems unfazed .
 At Collins ’ s post-match news conference Tuesday , a longtime tennis journalist from Europe began a question by saying : “ I hope you understand that we are used to meeting player when they ’ re kid . You are different from our point of view . ”
 He went on to compliment her maturity , which Collins attribute to a route le taken . Her family couldn ’ t afford the elite academy and junior circuit that mold small child into young professional , so she went to college on an athletic scholarship to get her seasoning .
 She started at the University of Florida , then transferred to the University of Virginia . Collins won two N.C.A.A . single title while earning a degree in medium study and making lifelong friend , many of them non-athletes .
 “ I think not being a child prodigy , not being a superstar at a young age , certainly humbled me , made me in a way work harder for thing , ” Collins said , adding , “ I think it ’ s kind of made me hungrier in some way , like not having that , ‘ Oh , I ’ ve always been really amazing at tennis. ’ It wasn ’ t always like that . ”
 Collins come across a feisty — her mother said she ’ d had “ a fighting spirit ” since childhood . Collins also ooze confidence , regardless of circumstance .
 One of her favorite course at Virginia wa Denise Stewart ’ s introduction to drama .
 “ One of the thing she taught u is sometimes you ’ ve got to go to your job and you ’ ve got to sit in that cubicle when you don ’ t want to for eight hour and fake it till you make it , ” Collins said . “ And so much of life is acting . You ’ ve got to always have a positive mind-set . ”
 Stewart said she wa not surprised that Collins had found the big stage . Her success , she said , transcends tennis .
 “ She is such the right woman at this time to say , ‘ Humble is not my jam , ’ ” Stewart said .

 TOULOUSE , France — Since a solo flight by the Wright brother on the shore of North Carolina more than a century ago , the size of airplane ha gone in one direction — up . But the era of ever larger jet , and the romantic idea of continent-hopping travel they inspired , came to an unofficial end with the announcement by Airbus on Thursday that it plan to cease production of the A380 , the largest passenger airliner ever built .
 An engineering marvel expansive enough for shower and sleekly designed bar , the plane hark back to the age when flying had glamour . The four engine are powerful enough to reach cruising altitude in roughly 15 minute , all the while keeping noise to a tolerable hum . There are fan club for the A380 on both Twitter and Facebook .
 But for year , the jet ha been far more popular with passenger than airline . When it debuted in 2005 , the A380 wa a bet that the future of air travel wa big plane flying between major hub , followed by connector to final destination .
 Instead , the dominant trend became smaller plane and direct flight . Dropping $ 445 million for a jet — the A380 ’ s list price — that can carry more than 500 people made little economic sense , especially a budget airline cropped up a competition .
 Airbus , which is based in Toulouse , struggled to market the A380 for year and never sold one to an American carrier . Citing reduced order from Emirates Airline , a major customer , and an inability to find other buyer , the company said it would halt delivery of the jetliner in 2021 . ( It will continue to support existing A380s . )
 “ As a result of this decision we have no substantial A380 backlog and hence no basis to sustain production , despite all our sale effort with other airline in recent year , ” the company ’ s chief executive , Tom Enders , said in a statement .
 When Airbus started developing the A380 about two decade ago , airport congestion wa a rising concern . The company offered it supersized jet , a 6,000-square-foot double-decker , a a way to get more traveler on and off limited tarmac space . Airbus spent $ 25 billion developing the plane , which is about 50 percent larger than it nearest rival , Boeing ’ s 747 .
 But it turned out that the solution to congested airport wa not larger plane . It wa smaller plane at a wide variety of le crowded airport . Airlines reduced cost by offering direct flight on jet that were cheaper to maintain , in part because they were landing at airport with lower fee and in part because they were burning le gas .
 The A380 “ is an aircraft of a previous generation where fuel wa not a big of an issue , ” said Frank Netscher , an analyst at Scope Group , a credit-rating company . “ It ’ s not by accident that all the new model will only have two engine , not four . ”
 The age of the jumbo jet ha been winding down for a while . Last year , Boeing ’ s 747 , the original mega-plane , with the iconic hump , took it last flight for an airline based in it home country , the United States .
 Competition had already shifted from the S.U.V.s of the sky to the sedan , with Airbus ’ s more compact and flexible A350 going head to head against Boeing ’ s 787 , which can carry a little more than half the number of passenger a a 747 .
 To Robert W. Mann , an airline consultant in Port Washington , N.Y. , all of these development seemed inevitable 15 year ago .
 “ If you think of market size a a pyramid , there are zillion of market at the bottom of the pyramid that have very small volume , ” Mr. Mann said . “ If you look at why the 787 and A350 are so popular , they have better range , and better range at smaller market size . They can capitalize on those part of the pyramid that you could never fly an A380 economically . ”
 The plane ’ s survival wa ensured only by Emirates , which us it home in Dubai a a hub for about 1,500 flight a week . Emirates wa Airbus ’ s biggest A380 customer , with a fleet of more than 100 . The manufacturer wa so dependent on the airline that it acknowledged in January 2018 that it might cancel production of the jet , barring an Emirates order . A few day later , Emirates asked for $ 16 billion worth of the plane .
 Since then , the airline ha been buffeted by the same force that have transformed the rest of the industry . Emirates decided to take delivery of just 14 more A380s over the next two year , while ordering 70 smaller aircraft that can serve smaller airport .
 “ While we are disappointed to have to give up our order , and sad that the program could not be sustained , we accept that this is the reality of the situation , ” Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum , the chairman and chief executive of Emirates Airline and Group , said in a statement . “ For u , the A380 is a wonderful aircraft loved by our customer and our crew . It is a differentiator for Emirates . ”
 The A380 took another hit last week when the Australian airline Qantas canceled it long outstanding order , placed in 2006 , for eight of the plane .
 The decision to cease production of the A380 will prompt job cut at Airbus , potentially affecting a many a 3,500 of it 134,000 employee over the next three year . The move also overshadowed positive news in Airbus ’ s full-year earnings report .
 Net income rose 29 percent in 2018 to 3.1 billion euro , or about $ 3.5 billion . Airbus said the decision to wind down production of the A380 wa reflected in the 2018 financial figure , with the company taking a €463 million hit because of the decision by Emirates to scale back it order .
 Airbus did not give up easily on the A380 , said Mr. Enders , the chief executive . But the demand wasn ’ t there . “ If you have a product that nobody want any more or you can only sell below production cost , you have to stop it , a painful a it is , ” he said .
 Mr. Enders emphasized that the airplane would not disappear any time soon , noting that it wa likely to be a presence in the sky into the 2030s .
 “ We ’ re talking about the end of a production , ” he said at a news conference after the company earnings . “ We ’ re not talking about end of a program . ”
 To aviation analyst , the story of the A380 is the stuff of business case study , and not the flattering kind . The life and death of the jet will stand a an example of the high cost of poor forecasting .
 “ It wa supposed to be a game changer , ” Mr. Netscher of Scope Group said . “ But , yeah , well , the game changed . ”

 Or mine isn ’ t , anyway .
 By Jennifer Senior
 Opinion columnist
 I am trying to think about when , exactly , I realized that my brain wa wretchedly ill suited to the modern world . Was it when Twitter began ? With the internet itself ?
 Certainly by this current presidency . I know that much .
 I think , for instance , of Fridays , often slow day in the news business , when journalist catch up on email and sneak out for haircut and therapist appointment . Hard to do these day .
 Three Fridays ago , Roger Stone wa hauled off by guy in blue windbreaker by sunrise and Donald Trump decided by 3 to reopen the government , ending the longest shutdown in history ; two Fridays ago , the president suspended one of the last remaining arm control treaty , potentially reigniting the nuclear race .
 I am closing this piece on Friday morning . Not yet knowing what will happen , and how much will happen , fill me with an inexpressible relief .
 It should be noted that this problem of split-screen consciousness is likely to get worse in the era of divided government , not better . It won ’ t just be the president laying claim to our attention , but also those who are holding him to account . Even if our government were a paradigm of functionality , we ’ d surely be fighting for custody of our brain . In 2016 , before Trump wa elected , Gloria Mark , a professor of informatics at the University of California , Irvine , examined the daily habit of 40 information worker . She discovered they checked their email 77 time per day , on average , and slalomed between screen every 47 second .
 Many evolutionary biologist are fond of pointing out that the human body is not adapted to modern life , which often involves sitting for hour at a time and toiling in artificial light and consuming mound of processed sugar ( “ There ’ s no food in your food , ” a the Joan Cusack character say in “ Say Anything ” ) . But the same design problem , it could be argued , is true of the human brain : It wa not engineered to process the volume of information we ’ re getting , and at the rate we ’ re getting it .
 “ Our brain evolved to help u deal with life during the hunter-gatherer phase of human history , a time when we might encounter no more than a thousand people across the entire span of our lifetime , ” writes the neuroscientist Daniel Levitin in “ The Organized Mind : Thinking Straight in the Age of Information Overload . ”
 Recently , I phoned Levitin . He told me he suspect that human during the Trump era are unwittingly re-enacting the rat experiment that James Olds and Peter Milner did in the 1950s , wherein the creature repeatedly pressed a lever to feel an electric jolt to their reward center . The poor subject became such hostage to gratification that they stopped eating , drinking , even having sex . Eventually , they died of exhaustion .
 The business I ’ m in self-selects for those with a pretty high threshold for those jolt . I stare at my colleague sometimes and marvel at what a different breed they are , the true exotics of the specie : They ’ re like bug with eye all over their head , evolved to take in several stream of information simultaneously . Walk by their desk , and it look something like Norad . They ’ re staring at multiple screen fringed with multiple tab , while Twitter , email and text cascade down their phone .
 Whereas me ? I ’ m a Cyclops . I tend to see one thing at a time . Before Trump , I could go day without looking at the newspaper . I ’ m partial to 19th-century novel , and I envy their heroine , who spend their day reading and needlepointing and playing piano . I find it far easier to tolerate the whistling emptiness of boredom than the casino rattle of too much stimulation .
 But to opt out of this clanging multiverse is to live in mild estrangement . It ’ s to feel one ’ s self become a permanent spectator ; to live with the persistent sense that something is always happening elsewhere ; to feel old , outlasted , outmatched by the bizarre physic of your own lifetime : The great spinning world ha toppled off it axis and rolled away .
 It can not be an accident that the lion of Silicon Valley , who live and die by the information whorl , are bullish on meditation . Bill Gates wrote a blog post a couple of month ago about it , praising the practice for focusing his busy mind . Twitter ’ s Jack Dorsey meditates , a we all learned from a string of insensitive tweet he recently unleashed from Myanmar . ( It ’ s a fine line between mindfulness and mindlessness , apparently . ) When the world ’ s coming at you in great cloud of 280-character Frisbees , naturally it ’ s tempting to vanish into the forest dark of your own mind .
 Of course , complaint about the unmanageable velocity of the world have been with u since industrialization , if not before . I once joked to my husband that I feared napping because I might miss an indictment . Turns out Henry David Thoreau made a similar complaint in the age of the telegraph . “ Hardly a man take a half-hour ’ s nap after dinner , ” he wrote , “ but when he wake he hold up his head and asks , ‘ What ’ s the news ? ’ a if the rest of mankind had stood his sentinel . ”
 I ’ m not convinced , a some people are , that the Twitter fusillade from the White House are part of a larger strategy of distraction , specifically intended to divert u from this particular administration ’ s malfeasance and failure . I think our president ’ s attention span is genuinely scattershot . ( “ Post-literate , ” Michael Wolff called him in “ Fire and Fury. ” Seems about right . ) When I imagine his brain , I imagine a bug zapper in a drizzle . Bzzzzzzzzzzt . Fzzzz . Bzzz fzzz bzzzzzzzzzzt .
 But Trump chaos , both intentional and otherwise , ha proved a great de facto political strategy , precisely because we are neurologically incapable of handling it . The one thing we know about any interrupted activity is that it take an awful lot of energy to return to whatever last had our attention .
 For what it ’ s worth , Gloria Mark say that woman , in her research , tend to self-interrupt le frequently than men . Daniel Levitin say the same , and that we seem to have more glucose available to replenish our battered neuron than men do . It ’ s an argument for having an all-female White House press corp . ( Maggie Haberman and Ashley Parker : Our nation turn it lonely eye to you . )
 Would that I were able to task-switch a they do . Would that we all could . Would that we all could return to the rhythm of a more civilized time , when we weren ’ t scanning the savanna for mortal threat every 30 second . It seems such an unfathomable luxury — almost a unfathomable a the Russians manipulating our election , a a child billionaire selling our privacy down the river , a the Trump presidency itself .

 A talent for strategy and puzzle solving help a young woman find her place in the world of video gaming .
 By Maria Teresa Hart
 After year of playing with yard-sale toy , my brother and I had finally hit the jackpot : a Nintendo gaming system , set up on our living room television . We wedged in the cartridge , picked up the controller and set it to two-player mode . The eight-bit music bleeped through it intro , and little Mario began his pixelated sidestep through the booby trap .
 This wa a turning point in my relationship with my brother . He and I had always been a duo . “ I ’ m Batman and you ’ re Robin ! ” he ’ d announce , rigging our bunk bed into a makeshift Bat Cave .
 This new game seemed much harder than saving Gotham . My brother ’ s character easily zipped through castle after castle , while my Mario died a hundred death on the first level . I wa ready to swear off this “ boy toy , ” stomp off to my room and tea party like there wa no tomorrow . But a he entered a water world , bobbing along to a carnival tune , I sank back into my seat , mesmerized . I didn ’ t play , but I didn ’ t leave . The princess might be on the next screen , and I wanted to help find her .
 I watched my brother for a while and then said , “ If you just walk along the seafloor , the Bloopers can ’ t reach you . ”
 “ It worked ! ” my brother marveled .
 In that moment , I wa recast a a wingman and problem solver . This new approach led to hour of u gaming together . My brother would assume the control to countless game , and I would watch , providing help on any puzzle . Our arrangement extended to desktop game , too , like the medieval-themed Ultima and King ’ s Quest , where my flair for wordplay made me indispensable .
 “ Something is glinting behind the book , ” the game prompted .
 “ Try ‘ move lever , ’ ‘ push lever , ’ ‘ pull lever , ’ ” I suggested , listing option in rapid fire .
 Eventually , our duo split up . My brother went off to college and the Nintendo wa shelved . I graduated from playtime with a sibling to feminism and punk rock , donning Doc Martens and baby doll dress to see band like Hole and Bikini Kill .
 “ Chicks up front ! ” I ’ d howl at every punk concert , claiming a spot at the front of the stage .
 Inside a churning mosh pit of fellow woman , I learned the importance of taking up space , seizing control and standing front and center in a world that constantly deposit girl in the back . But this new perspective made me ashamed of my gaming history . I had mainly been a watcher in gaming , and I worried that my hands-off approach played right into the stereotype of “ girlfriend mode ” — the dismissive nickname bestowed on the “ easy ” setting by bro game designer .
 On occasion , I would muddle through a game by myself , a racing game here , a boxing match there , but I didn ’ t enjoy the mania of jamming button in rapid progression . It made homework out of playtime . I just wanted to work on digital puzzle with someone to keep me company . So why did it feel a if I wa failing womankind ?
 Postcollege , I remained conflicted , but love made me resume my role a puzzle-solving wingman . I moved in with a serious gamer , and PlayStation loomed large in our relationship . We wandered through the Greek mythology of God of War and the brush stroke painting of Okami . Happily for me , this new generation of game wa loaded with riddle , jigsaw and logic puzzle .
 To ease my sheepishness about my sidekick role , I tried to see u a the Bonnie and Clyde of gaming . I told myself we were pulling off heist . And a with any good heist , we each had our specialty : He wa the firepower and muscle , I wa the safecracker and decoder .
 “ Look there ! ” I called out halfway through the haunted hellscape of Silent Hill . “ When we rotate the cube , the position of the door in the room move ! That ’ s how we find our exit . ”
 “ This is why I love doing this together ! ” my then-boyfriend beamed . “ You ’ re like having my own personal cheat code . ”
 Despite our victory , the relationship didn ’ t last . We were better in a virtual world than in the real one .
 After the split , I found a close friend , Dave , to team up with , and we proceeded to play our way through the Resident Evil canon . These were prescribed evening of cheese pizza , strawberry ice cream and Xbox a we tried to avoid the kill screen — a ghoulish “ You Are Dead ” splattered in ketchup-red lettering .
 Those evening were fun . But I still felt a if I wa using this entertainment in an off-label way that betrayed my feminist value .
 One day I asked Dave , “ Do you think it ’ s bad that I never take up the controller ? ” His answer finally pushed the reset button on my thought .
 “ We ’ re all spectator in the gaming world , ” he said . “ That ’ s how you learn , how you improve , how you win . So you ’ re not just passively watching , you ’ re studying . Plus , puzzle solving is at the heart of every game . ”
 Another thing that flipped my perspective : Dave and I were typically joined on game night by our significant others . Suddenly I had a gaming crew , fellow spectator and problem solver . My boyfriend attended with a notebook in hand , madly doodling when we weren ’ t sketching out the latest mechanical puzzle . I wa finally ready to consider myself a legitimate gamer .
 “ Ready ? ” Dave asked a he switched on the console , hunching toward the TV .
 “ Ready ! ” I answered , picking up pen and paper . “ Wait . ”
 I lifted my chair from the back of the room and scooted it next to the TV , level with his , smiling . “ Chicks up front . ”

 The U.S. should not copy China ’ s command-and-control playbook . Markets are still best at driving economic growth .
 By Veronique de Rugy
 Ms. de Rugy is a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University .
 China ’ s post-Mao economic boom ha occurred only to the extent that the country became capitalist . With “ Made in China 2025 , ” Beijing ’ s 2015 anticapitalist plan for an industrial policy under which the state would pick “ winner , ” China ha taken a step back from capitalism . ( It recently dropped the “ Made in China 2025 ” name , though the policy remains . )
 It won ’ t work , but China ’ s new industrial policy ha worked one marvel — namely , scaring many American conservative into believing that the main driver of economic growth isn ’ t the market but bureaucrat invested with power to control the allocation of natural and financial resource .
 Exhibit A is a report just out from the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship , headed by Marco Rubio of Florida , on how to counter Beijing ’ s plan .
 The report echo widespread fear about China ’ s plan to use top-down , nonmarket mean such a tariff , subsidy and capital restriction to pursue global dominance in 10 industrial sector like clean-energy car , robotics and aerospace . The Rubio report asserts that such dominance “ would be an unacceptable outcome for American worker . ”
 Mr. Rubio ’ s somewhat surprising response is to in effect call for the United States to adopt it own industrial policy . It would include prioritizing manufacturing , protecting American company in industry China want to make headway in , restriction on investment and capital flow , tax change that encourage United States tech company to spend more on research and development rather than on buyback , and support for small business .
 China ’ s economic growth and sheer size are something to reckon with . Yet that doesn ’ t mean that authoritarian method will enable China to attain economic dominance . I thought we learned this lesson after many American intellectual , economist and politician were proven spectacularly wrong in predicting that the Soviet Union would become an economic rival .
 State planning will darken China ’ s economic prospect . Its resource are limited , so any expansive government investment in one , two or 10 sector of it economy diverts resource from other sector , threatening their future growth .
 Free-market proponent usually understand that , plagued by ignorance of all-important localized knowledge , government official can not outperform the market at picking winner . In practice it end up picking loser or hindering the ability of the winner to achieve their greatest potential . Central planning is antithetical to innovation , a is already visible in China .
 You can give Senator Rubio some point for consistency : Believing that top-down government planning work in China , he now belief it also work in America . Still , the same obstacle that limit the carrying out of many government policy in the United States — for example , the initial failure to open and maintain the HealthCare.gov website — will ensure that many of Beijing ’ s plan will fail .
 But even if this time really is different and China becomes “ the global leader in innovation and manufacturing , ” it still doesn ’ t follow that the United States government should respond with more of it own intervention . First , the law of comparative advantage still hold and so it would continue to be beneficial for China to import product that are produced more efficiently elsewhere . Second , the United States ha instituted industrial policy in the past out of unwarranted fear of other country ’ industrial policy . The result have always imposed great cost on consumer and taxpayer and introduced significant economic distortion .
 Conservatives — who take pride in their respect for history — should learn about the failed United States industrial policy of the 1980s , which were response to the Japanese government ’ s attempt to dominate key consumer electronics technology . These effort worked neither in Japan nor in the United States .
 The past ha taught u that industrial policy fail often because they favor existing industry that are well connected politically at the expense of would-be entrepreneur and start-ups offering more innovative solution .
 And so contrary to the Rubio report , we should not prioritize manufacturing , to cite one example . Yes , manufacturing generates the majority of export revenue in rich country . But despite popular opinion , trade ’ s benefit are not measured by the amount that are exported . As economist since Adam Smith have pointed out , the ultimate goal of trade is to receive a many import a possible .
 Also , Mr. Rubio ’ s report errs in concluding that because manufacturing wage are high , policymakers should work to increase employment in manufacturing . Wages in manufacturing are high because labor-saving innovation have increased worker ’ productivity and , thus , their wage . But any worker artificially shifted into manufacturing would be redundant — and being redundant , their productivity and their wage would be low .
 This doesn ’ t mean there ’ s no role for government . In fact , the Clinton year should have taught politician that the most effective industrial policy is to clear and protect space for innovation , a wa done in 1997 with the administration ’ s Framework for Global Electronic Commerce . This posture of “ permissionless innovation ” for digital commerce kick-started the development of the American-led commercial internet .
 The same lesson applies to the competition for 5G technology ( mentioned only twice in the Rubio report ) . China might end up leading in 5G patent and hardware production . This possibility raise privacy concern — for instance , that China would influence the worldwide convergence on 5G standard to aid it to spy on user . Still , it ’ s difficult to believe that the Chinese could impose an anti-privacy standard with so many privacy watchdog at the table . If there are national security issue , they should be addressed with national security mean , not economic policy .
 We shouldn ’ t allow fear-mongering to hobble America ’ s free enterprise system . That system ha proved remarkable at delivering what consumer care about , like speed , broadband service and application . The researcher Brent Skorup lay out many simple way the government could encourage 5G development in the United States . For starter , Mr. Skorup note , the federal government could free up underused part of the federal radio spectrum for new us like 5G . Then , the federal government should work with state and city to repeal statute that prohibit homeowner from freely installing 5G equipment on their own property ( which would expand broadband access ) . Local official should see the 5G rollout not a a mere revenue generator but a a national campaign for a more innovative and dynamic economy .
 China ’ s economic future is bright , but only a long a it reject large-scale industrial policy and instead recommits to competitive market . We shouldn ’ t copy it recent command-and-control playbook . Rather , we should stick with the time-honored policy that have made the United States the titan to topple in the first place : free trade , competitive market , reasonable regulation and the rule of law . Maybe China will decide to mimic more of our behavior instead .

 On Soccer
 By Rory Smith
 LIVERPOOL , England — Friday morning , and Goodison Park is quiet . There are no fan milling around the street outside , spilling out of the Winslow pub , eagerly rushing to their seat . There is no noise , no color , no riot of blue and white . There are only a handful of car in the parking lot . It is spitting with rain .
 A stadium is a home , but that is , in truth , only an occasional role . These are place that blossom only every other weekend , a Goodison will on Sunday when Liverpool arrives for the latest Merseyside Derby . For much of the rest of the time , though , a stadium is dormant , quiet : an empty , expectant shell .
 The day-to-day life of a club — the part of it that are dedicated to the business of soccer , and the part of it dedicated to the soccer business — happens elsewhere . For Everton , the former is at Finch Farm , it training facility on the eastern fringe of Liverpool . The latter is in the Liver Buildings , on the city ’ s sparkling waterfront , where Everton relocated it office last year , a new home for all those department whose job it is to sell shirt and ticket and sponsorship deal . To most fan , a club is a team , hopefully to win game . To all owner , a club is a business , hopefully to make money .
 A club is more than that , though ; there is another side , one which doe it work not on the field at Goodison Park or in the suite of office in the city , but in the tight warren of terraced street that surround the stadium , in school across Liverpool , in some of the most underprivileged part of Merseyside .
 Across the street from Goodison Park , a group of child are playing on the Cruyff Court — a small , artificial soccer field surrounded by a metal cage , built in conjunction with the Johan Cruyff Foundation — behind Everton ’ s community hub . Inside , teenager mill and mingle with teacher and coach in Everton polo shirt .
 Around the corner , in what wa once a run-down working men ’ s club , a few dozen retiree are spending the morning cycling through their memory — of Everton , of the city — over tea and cake . Pat van den Hauwe , a tough-tackling defender who played for the team in the 1980s , is helping serve the coffee .
 On Goodison Road , the club ha bought three house and converted them into drop-in center , safe space for anyone who feel they need a place to go . Their door are always open . There is always someone to talk to . There is always food in the fridge .
 All club run outreach program , of course , and employ staff member to work in the community they call home . But few , if any , can match Everton ’ s for size and scope . The building that house Everton in the Community cost more than $ 10 million to develop ; the program ’ s annual budget is around $ 4 million . It ha 125 staff member and 145 volunteer . It work in more than 200 location : school , youth club , community center .
 There is barely a part of life in Liverpool — and particularly in the L4 postal code that is home to both Goodison Park and Anfield , Liverpool ’ s stadium , and among the most deprived area in Britain — that the club doe not touch .
 It oversees more than 40 social program , focused on issue a diffuse a mental health and serious organized crime ; it reach more than 20,000 people a year . Last year , Everton won a grant of 700,000 pound , or about $ 925,000 , to lead a government scheme on Merseyside to tackle gang culture . It ha a presence in 150 school . In September 2015 , it became the first club to launch it own school .
 Everton ha , for more than a decade , styled itself a Liverpool ’ s People ’ s Club , a term popularized by David Moyes , it former manager , to distinguish it from it near neighbor . Banners bearing the phrase flutter from Goodison Park ; scarf embossed with the slogan can be bought from stand around the stadium on match day .
 “ Our fan hold u up against that image , ” Everton ’ s chief executive , Denise Barrett-Baxendale , said . “ They expect u to live up to it . It is not a corporate social responsibility program . It is long-term , strategic work . It is a huge component of what Everton is. ” So substantial , in fact , that before she wa promoted to running Everton last year , Barrett-Baxendale ran not the commercial section of the club , or it merchandising arm , but it community department .
 It is not just the scale of Everton ’ s work that mark it a different , though ; it is the scope of it , too . Everton go into area other club — and other charity , even — might find “ intimidating , ” a Barrett-Baxendale put it . Sue Gregory , Everton in the Community ’ s director of youth engagement , recall representative of other team marveling at the fact that Everton — in theory , just a soccer club — wa prepared to work with convicted criminal , drug dealer , member of gang . “ You could see it a the club risking it brand , ” she said .
 Barrett-Baxendale doe not . “ We work on these issue because these issue exist on the street of Merseyside , ” she said . It is a view supported throughout the club . At the start of the season , Everton ’ s player signed a pledge that they would do their part to help with community work . A copy of it hang on a wall in the Community ’ s hub . There have been time that player have had to be reminded to leave after session there : Tom Davies , the midfielder , once insisted he wa happy to stay for a long a possible at one session because he wa busy “ coloring in unicorn . ”
 Gregory , her staff and her volunteer know how much all of that matter . They hear all of the story : the teenager forced to work selling drug for gang to settle their parent ’ debt , or chased through the street for punishment beating ; the boy sent hundred of mile from home a part of the “ county line ” phenomenon , in which city gang seek to control the drug market in smaller town ; the child who stock up on food at the session because there is not enough to eat at home .
 Everton doe not have a choice , in other word , but to confront those problem . Shying away from them would make all the work it doe nothing but tokenism . “ This is our community , ” Gregory said , adding : “ These are the issue our community face . There is a culture of ‘ let ’ s try . ’ ”
 Wherever it can , it make the most of the power of it crest : The white-on-blue depiction of Prince Rupert ’ s Tower , instantly recognizable , is part of the city ’ s civic scenery . It transcends tribal loyalty — many Liverpool fan are part of the Everton program — and represents , instead , permanence .
 “ People trust the badge , ” said Richard Kenyon , Everton in the Community ’ s chief executive . “ They respond to it in a really powerful way . They ’ re drawn to it . ”
 Those who would normally eschew authority figure , those who would not respond to local government or a school principal , respond to that crest . Everton , they know , is not going anywhere .
 “ We are a consistent presence , ” Gregory said . “ Kids might have a really good connection with a teacher in one year , but then they move on , and the kid lose that . We are always there , so that bond is not lost . ”
 This , more than the team or the business , is what a club is , what a club can do . Not far from Goodison Park is one of Everton in the Community ’ s smallest project : a little corner of scrap land that ha been converted into an herb garden . The plot is little more than a postage stamp . When Everton started it , encouraging child from these street to tend to it , some worried that it would be ruined , vandalized , maybe even in it first few day . That wa month ago . It is still pristine .

 SUGAR RUN By Mesha Maren309 pp . Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill . $ 26.95 .
 “ Sugar Run ” explores place , connection and redemption in the face of the justice system and the struggle to avoid destructive choice . The book begin with the protagonist Jodi ’ s release from prison after having served 18 year — more than half her life — for a murder she later laconically think “ had all the thrilling element the newspaper craved : kidnapping , violence , sex. ” The literary lineage here are hard-boiled fiction and film noir , but on every page of her debut novel , Mesha Maren creates bold new take on those venerable genre , a much needed refresh of worn trope and clichés .
 The ravaged but still-beautiful mountain of West Virginia ’ s coal country were once Jodi ’ s home , and she yearns to go back . She dream of finding refuge on her dead grandmother ’ s land and hope to discover if making a new life is even possible . Except first she head to southern Georgia to fulfill an implied teenage pact , made before prison , to save the brother of her magnetically criminal , now dead ex-girlfriend , Paula , from his horribly abusive father .
 That long Greyhound ride spool out wonderfully and descriptively a Jodi experience the shock of freedom and the change America ha undertaken during the year she lived with no view of the outside world except straight up from the prison yard to blank sky . On the bus she watch the flow of landscape a the mountain of north Georgia become “ nothing but bruise-blue hump beyond the yellow fields. ” She note passing place name that hark back to the Cherokee , and marvel at the unimaginable eruption of modern Atlanta , it skyscraper like “ rocket ship of glass and chrome ” and it inhabitant all “ clutching newspaper , cardboard cup of coffee and cellphones. ” Men keep “ popping up right in that moment of pleasant silence , ” and she come to reflect on prison a a place where she wa “ preserved , safe from her own self . ”
 A few day later , Jodi ha completed her quest and fulfilled her decades-old promise to Paula . Except the abused boy , Ricky , is now a troubled and troubling adult , rescued but not always grateful to his savior . Along the way Jodi ha also found a new locus of desire , Miranda — a beautiful , impulsive young woman with an addictive personality and three young child from her broken marriage to a faded country music star . Jodi and Miranda ’ s complex relationship , with it tough and delicate moment of attraction and then romance , shape one of the book ’ s strongest movement .
 Before the six of them — damaged and desperate — shoehorn into Miranda ’ s Chevette and head up to West Virginia in time for Jodi ’ s first appointment with her parole officer , Jodi tell Ricky , “ Whatever you want for a new life , bring it here with you in the morning. ” But the new life they ’ re all fleeing toward is harsh , and it margin so tight that a welfare benefit card count a a major asset .
 Throughout the narrative , which jump back and forth in time between the late 1980s and 2007 , the event leading to Jodi ’ s conviction spin in her memory , becoming clearer bit by bit . Her teenage affair with Paula once took Jodi into a dark , frightening and exciting underworld of gambling , gun and passion . At one point , remembering a flight in a small plane over the ocean with Paula , Jodi search in vain for the right word to describe the color of the water , a elusive a her swirling emotion — word sufficient to “ catch the heart-wild magic of it . ”
 Now , back in West Virginia with her collection of fugitive , Jodi hold to her prison vision of living simply on the land , an old and deeply American dream that is hard to let go . She find that her grandmother ’ s farm ha been sold , but that doesn ’ t deter her from moving her group into the cabin anyway for a brief cigarette-and-whiskey outlaw idyll . Instead of peace and hope and love , however , they find they ’ re under constant threat in an Appalachian community gutted by meth and opioids , by fracking creeping so close that a neighbor can set his tap water on fire , and , a always , by limitation on upward mobility for the underprivileged that have been baked into American culture from it beginning .
 Though the powerful pull of land and home and sense of place persist , one of the primary question “ Sugar Run ” asks is what these concept even mean now in this country . Maren is masterly at describing America ’ s modern wasteland , the blasted town not yet and maybe never-to-be the beneficiary of rehabilitation and reoccupation . The book ’ s landscape is dotted with roadside casino trailer , abandoned mining operation , country brothel set up like prison with chain-link fence and armed guard to control both the customer and the immigrant prostitute . Jodi ’ s own brother us her in an opioid transaction and then threatens her by suggesting that local might consider Miranda ’ s child better off with a “ more Christian ” family . How do you possibly find or make a home under such condition ?
 In searching for answer to those question , resolution to those conflict , the book ’ s conclusion perhaps miss an opportunity when it veers toward action and violence and away from one of it greatest strength — it clear focus on character and place .
 But that doesn ’ t diminish the cumulative effect of the graceful prose , which reach back in the best way to it noir predecessor . You can almost see Maren — like Raymond Chandler — cutting each typed page into three strip and requiring each strip to contain something delightful ( startling simile , clever dialogue , brilliant description ) offered to the reader a recompense for a world that press up against you all raw and aggressive and dangerous . A language that fully owns it power to capture just that “ heart-wild magic . ”
 The biographical note with an earlier version of this review misstated the title of Charles Frazier ’ s most recent novel . It is “ Varina , ” not “ Vienna . ”

 By Ben Brantley
 Even it title vibrates vertiginously with layer of meaning . Most literally , “ White Noise , ” Suzan-Lori Parks ’ s enthrallingly thought-packed new play at the Public Theater , refers to the whoosh generated by those much-used , soothing sound maker designed to lull people to sleep .
 Such a device , we learn early in this astringent and eloquent work from the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning “ Topdog/Underdog , ” wa a gift to an insomniac in his 30 named Leo ( a smashing Daveed Diggs ) , who hasn ’ t had a good night ’ s rest since he wa 5 .
 It worked . It also backfired , to the point that this anxious young artist stopped making art . Blessed unconsciousness , it appears , is not a state that Leo can afford to be in it right now .
 Nor , it seems , can any American , not when it come to dealing with people of other skin color . That ’ s true even — no , especially — of those who pride themselves on their comfort with interracial relationship . Like the two couple at the center of Ms. Parks ’ s play , which opened on Wednesday and ha been directed with a radiant clarity by Oskar Eustis .
 The insulation of “ White Noise ” — and , yes , it ’ s a pun , though not one to which it author call attention — is what we wrap ourselves in to get through the day , to get along with others and to keep from hearing the lie that we live by . “ Woke ” acquires a whole new resonance here , and it is a state of awareness that scald .
 Every time Ms . Parks writes a play , she seems to come up with a brand-new genre . During the past several decade , her staged work have embraced symbolist fever dream ( “ The Death of the Last Black Man… ” ) , Brechtian fable ( “ In the Blood ” ) and Homeric epic ( “ Father Comes Home From the Wars ” ) .
 These production all considered , in different voice , American slavery a an enduringly enslaving legacy . In their experimental form and explosive content , they anticipated the rich influx of imaginative work in recent year by writer like Jackie Sibblies Drury ( “ Fairview ” ) and Jeremy O. Harris ( “ Slave Play ” ) .
 Now Ms . Parks is surprising New York audience once again , by writing what at first appears to be her slickest , most conventional play to date . On the surface , much of “ White Noise ” ha the bantering feel of a comedy of manner , in which two couple are configured into different combination .
 These would be Leo and Dawn ( Zoë Winters ) , a lawyer , and their closest of friend , Ralph ( Thomas Sadoski ) , an English professor , and Misha ( Sheria Irving ) , a vlogger . Embodied with consummate conviction by this superb four-member cast , they ’ ve all been besties since college , when Leo dated Misha and Ralph wa with Dawn .
 [ What ’ s new onstage and off : Sign up for our Theater Update newsletter . ]
 Ralph and Leo were the school bowling champ . ( Clint Ramos ’ s set crucially includes a bowling lane . ) And the four of them were part of a rock band whose sweet signature number about mutual love ( written by Ms . Parks ) is heard a the show begin . Oh , and for the record , Leo and Misha are black , while Ralph and Dawn are white .
 Not that this is a distinction that should need to be made these day , especially with such enlightened urban hipster a these four , right ? Yeah , right .
 The friend ’ carefully maintained equilibrium is shaken when Leo is roughed up by cop while taking an insomniac ’ s late-night walk in an affluent neighborhood . Dawn , a defense lawyer who proudly defines herself a “ one of the good guy , ” want Leo to sue the police . “ You need lot of justice , ” she say with maternal solicitude , a if justice were a group hug .
 But Leo ha another idea . ( A necessary spoiler follows . ) He want Ralph — who ha inherited big money from his unloving father , a bowling alley magnate — to buy him . That ’ s right . Leo want to be purchased a Ralph ’ s personal slave , for 40 day , at a price of $ 89,000 . ( That cover Leo ’ s credit card debt and college loan . ) It ’ s a way for Leo to explore his heritage and his anger , and a mean of “ showing the world how far we ’ ve not come . ”
 This sound like the sort of desperate gimmick that might be used in the final season of a trendy sitcom . But you may remember that 17 year ago , Edward Albee introduced a similarly audacious trope in “ The Goat , or Who Is Sylvia ? ” which turned the comedy of infidelity into Greek tragedy by having a happily married man fall in love with the four-legged title character .
 Ms . Parks doesn ’ t have Albee ’ s sure hand with traditional plotting . She us credibility-taxing short cut to hasten the collision among her character . ( Would The New Yorker really buy , edit and publish a short story from an unknown writer within a period of a few week ? )
 But she — and Mr. Eustis ’ s production — sustain a poker face that accepts such contrivance a part of a marginally heightened reality that nudge the everyday into the logically surreal . The production ’ s design team — which also includes Toni-Leslie James ( costume ) , Xavier Pierce ( lighting ) and Dan Moses Schreier ( sound ) — ha a bright , almost clinical clarity , which occasionally shade into distorting static .
 Any annoyance I felt with Ms. Parks ’ s plot contrivance wa erased by the thrill of the play ’ s uncompromising revelation of character . For Ms . Parks isn ’ t just confirming the familiar observation that if you scratch the surface of a liberal , you ’ ll find a racist .
 What motivates the character here is so much more complex and contradictory . The paradoxical essence of these people , stripped to their raw core , is shaped not just by History with a capital H , but by the individualizing specific of growing up in a particular home , with particular parent at a particular moment in time .
 These far-reaching back story persuasively inform how the character interact with one another . ( Only a rushed scene between the two woman , which segue from affection to antagonism , feel unnatural . ) But it ’ s the self-portrait they paint , through four ravishing monologue , that give this production it pulsing heart .
 Each performer ha one , delivered with a devastating transparency that expose the bad faith behind liberal righteousness , the anger behind glib irony , the id beneath the self-consciousness . Dawn , the daughter of psychiatrist , locates the immorality within her seemingly moral legal work . Perception , she suggests , is everything — and nothing .
 Misha , the daughter of two female academic , ha adopted a homegirl persona for her live streaming advice show , “ Ask a Black. ” ( As she put it , “ I dial up the Ebonics. ” ) The jocular , supportive Ralph seethes with a resentment that cut in any number of direction and eventually lead him into an ungodly sanctuary of like-minded men .
 As for Leo , his insomnia is an existential condition , with atavistic root , and though it ’ s possibly fatal it is also necessary . And in a breakout performance a a dramatic star , Mr. Diggs — best known a a jaunty Thomas Jefferson in “ Hamilton ” — show an aching emotional openness here that conveys the harsh and heavy price of staying awake in the world of the self-anesthetized .
 Though “ White Noise ” run a full three hour , and skid on some of it plot twist , it doesn ’ t feel long . By it end , you may marvel at how many form , face and exploitative us of racial identity it ha covered . In her monologue , Misha say that racism is a virus .
 “ The working of the virus are getting more complicated , ” she continues , “ and the reward are getting more sophisticated. ” She ’ s talking about the lucrative cultural industry that ha sprung out of parsing the racial divide — the best-selling book , blog , podcasts , video and even play like “ White Noise . ”
 In burrowing deep into what one character call “ the worm hole ” of how we talk — and think — about race , Ms . Parks isn ’ t cutting anyone any slack . Herself included .

 On Politics With Lisa Lerer
 By Lisa Lerer
 Hi . Welcome to On Politics , your guide to the day in national politics . I ’ m Lisa Lerer , your host .

 Last night , Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen found herself on the receiving end of what ha become a common occurrence in the Trump era : pushed out of office unceremoniously , with her departure announced in a tweet .
 Unlike some of the administration official fired before her , Ms. Nielsen wa hardly taken aback by the news . She ’ d turned in her resignation letter at a meeting earlier that day , and wa spotted dining at a waterside restaurant al fresco shortly after the president ’ s message hit Twitter .
 [ Read more about the president ’ s purge of official at the top of the Department of Homeland Security . ]
 How routine this kind of dismissal ha become got me thinking about all the convention President Trump ha broken in Washington — the breach he ’ s opened up in the unspoken manner , decorum and tradition that long governed the capital .
 Or , a we nerd in D.C. like to call them , norm .
 Now , there ’ s a case to be made that actual voter do not care all that much about our nerdy norm ( see : Mr. Trump ’ s victory , 2016 ) . There ’ s also evidence they do ( see : Mr. Trump ’ s fallen approval rating among independent voter ) . The reality is , until he ’ s back on the ballot , we don ’ t really know whether Mr. Trump ’ s consistent flouting of The Way Things Are Done matter to most Americans .
 The only thing we truly know about norm ? Over his nearly 27 month in Washington , Mr. Trump ha broken a whole lot of them .
 Here ’ s an incomplete list , largely from the past few week , in no particular order :
 Working in the White House : The White House used to be a place Washington ’ s climber clambered over each other to reach . Now it ’ s the kind of job few want to keep . Nearly 50 official have left the administration since Mr. Trump took office , according to a New York Times analysis , giving the president the record for both White House staff turnover and cabinet turnover . Last year , the White House even held a job fair to try and boost recruitment .
 Getting fired from the White House : Getting fired by the president seems , under normal circumstance , like a bad thing . In the Trump administration , though , some have seen it a the only way out while saving your reputation . Take Ms. Nielsen , for example . Though her legacy is likely linked with the president ’ s policy on separating migrant family at the border , her dismissal allows her to argue that she objected internally — and lost the fight — over some of the president ’ s most extreme position on immigration .
 [ Mr. Trump is pushing to restart the practice of family separation . Read more about that here . ]
 The cabinet : Ms. Nielsen ’ s departure mean there will be five “ acting ” secretary in the cabinet . A third of Mr. Trump ’ s cabinet hasn ’ t been subjected to the scrutiny of a Senate confirmation hearing — a step the Constitution requires . “ I like ‘ acting , ’ ” Mr. Trump told reporter in January . “ It give me more flexibility . ”
 Bipartisan power couple : Remember James Carville and Mary Matalin ? Their all-American , aisle-crossing love story wa the topic of book , television show , a speaking tour and even a bourbon ad . The Trump administration ’ s analog ? George and Kellyanne Conway , a fairly uncomfortable , Twitter-tastic train wreck that my colleague Mark Leibovich detailed last month .
 Thanksgiving : A study published in June found that celebration were about 30 to 50 minute shorter for Americans who crossed partisan line for the holiday than for those who traveled to area that voted like their own . That added up to 34 million hour of lost cross-partisan discourse in 2016 , according to the study ’ s author .
 Not fighting with dead people : Just ask John McCain , whom Mr. Trump slammed in March , seven month after his death , or the former first lady Barbara Bush . “ I have heard that she wa nasty to me , but she should be . Look what I did to her son , ” he said , last week .

 Democrats are logging a lot of mile in the early month of the 2020 race ( seriously : check out this graphic we put together of all their travel in March ) . This weekend , Matt Stevens , who is new to The Times ’ s politics team ( welcome ! ) , traveled across Iowa covering Bernie Sanders . He sent u this dispatch today .
 During his swing through Iowa this weekend , Senator Bernie Sanders did what candidate do : he talked a lot . And while I ’ ll admit I haven ’ t counted , the word I ’ m pretty sure he said the most wa “ radical ” — a in , his idea were once “ considered by establishment politician and mainstream medium to be ‘ radical . ’ ”
 A $ 15 minimum wage ? “ Too radical ! ” he chided .
 Guaranteed health care “ Much , much too radical . ”
 Expanding social security ? You get the idea .
 At rally and town hall from Davenport to Oskaloosa , Mr. Sanders sought to reclaim the label he said had been unfairly affixed to him in 2016 . The rhetoric allowed Mr. Sanders ’ sardonic side to shine a he argued that his policy idea were , in fact , far from radical , a evidenced by the increasingly warm embrace from the Democratic mainstream .
 That theory seemed to have some traction with several of the undecided voter I talked to . I stumbled upon two outside a rally in Fairfield who were marveling over the sheer number of policy area Mr. Sanders had covered in the span of an hour .
 “ Compared to his first run , he ’ s in the right timing , ” Sandra Glickman , a Democrat , said . “ The country ha changed — we ’ ve been tenderized , we ’ ve been outraged , and people are ready to receive what he ’ s talking about . Now his political revolution doesn ’ t seem so wild . ”
 As a result , Ms. Glickman , who is “ a few year older ” than Mr. Sanders , said she thought he actually sounded more confident compared with four year ago .
 Kathleen Johnson , 66 , an independent who had been talking with Ms. Glickman when I approached , agreed .
 And although Ms. Johnson said she is also hoping to meet candidate like Senators Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar , she said she appreciated that Mr. Sanders seemed to be looking at the “ big picture ” rather than one issue .
 In that vein , she had a homework assignment for me .
 “ Maybe , since you ’ re a reporter , you could list all of the topic , ” Ms. Johnson said . “ I want to have a gauge . Is everybody else going to talk about all those same topic , or narrow their scope ? ”

 The Carpetbagger
 How did “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” and “ Green Book ” prevail while big hit like “ A Star Is Born ” and “ Black Panther ” stumbled ?
 By Kyle Buchanan
 After a year filled with critically acclaimed movie from black director like Spike Lee , Ryan Coogler and Barry Jenkins , the Golden Globes last night gave one of their two top film trophy to “ Green Book , ” a racial-issues film from the white “ Dumb and Dumber ” director Peter Farrelly .
 The other top Globe went to “ Bohemian Rhapsody , ” which pulled off a rare best-drama win without a best-director nomination , a split that happened mainly because the director of this critically dismissed film , Bryan Singer , wa fired from the project midshoot .
 You can always count on the Hollywood Foreign Press Association , a quirky group of around 90 foreign journalist who vote on the Golden Globes , to make some left-of-center pick . ( Hey , the Globes are gon na Globe . ) But now that the dust ha settled from the best-comedy-or-musical win for “ Green Book ” and best-drama victory for “ Bohemian Rhapsody , ” your Carpetbagger is left wondering whether these choice are a unlikely a they might have seemed on Sunday night .
 Instead , should we treat them a emblematic of a mainstream sensibility that most moviegoer share ? And , after recently seeking to reward more popular film , will the Oscars follow suit ?
 [ Read about the highlight and lowlights from the Golden Globes . ]
 Before digging into these issue , I offer some caveat : The Hollywood Foreign Press share only one member in common with the Oscar-voting academy , and the latter is a vastly larger organization , so one group ’ s choice do not necessarily line up with what the other is inclined to reward .
 Still , much of award season is about momentum , and it never hurt to be seen winning . Voting opened for the Oscar nomination on Monday , and academy member weighing the crowded best-actress race will have last night ’ s terrific speech from Glenn Close and Olivia Colman at the top of their mind . Moments like those can make all the difference .
 Given that , how might the Globes have bent the trajectory of several key Oscar contender ?
 Certainly , they offer yet more proof that “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” can actually penetrate Oscar ’ s best-picture race despite it well-known production problem . This biopic of Queen frontman Freddie Mercury ha become a worldwide hit , and star Rami Malek , who also picked up a Globe for best actor in a drama , ha chosen to address the Singer imbroglio mainly by not mentioning it at all . At the film ’ s first industry screening in October , Malek effusively thanked the producer Graham King for spearheading the project , the sort of plaudit a leading man normally save for his director .
 That recontextualization appears to have worked : The Screen Actors Guild and Producers Guild of America both nominated the movie , and after the Globes gave “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” even more momentum , it would now be a notable surprise if the film failed to make the best-picture lineup .
 Still , it ’ s striking that “ A Star Is Born ” came up short on Sunday night , winning only the best song Globe for it anthemic Bradley Cooper/Lady Gaga duet “ Shallow. ” Given that “ A Star Is Born ” is a critically acclaimed story about show business that wa also a huge hit with moviegoer , this film really ought to be steamrolling it way toward a best picture win . Yet year-end critic group mainly gave it the cold shoulder , and the Globes followed suit . What give ?
 Some of this may come down to campaigning . While Malek ha shown up almost everywhere , happily spinning story for interested voter , Cooper ha proved to be a more recessive presence , and at many important event — like the star-studded Governors Awards in November — he wa absent entirely . It ha fallen to Gaga to do the lion ’ s share of schmoozing , and she ha proved to be a warm and able campaigner , yet her authenticity wa still called into question by Globe host Andy Samberg and Sandra Oh , who poked fun at Gaga ’ s tendency to repeat a single canned line about Cooper ’ s belief in her .
 The “ A Star Is Born ” team hoped Sunday night would be a coronation ; instead , they got a light roast .
 “ Green Book ” and “ Black Panther ” didn ’ t compete in the same category at the Globes — the former won the best comedy-musical trophy , while the latter came up short in the best-drama race — yet I think the victory for “ Green Book ” help explain why “ Black Panther , ” a cultural phenomenon , took no Globes . While this Marvel movie wa a hit with critic , it ’ s still a superhero film , and industry voter may not be prepared to give that genre it top prize .
 The fact-based “ Green Book , ” on the other hand , is so familiar in it contour that many have likened it to previous award contender like “ Driving Miss Daisy ” and “ The Help. ” This period story of an Italian-American bouncer ( Viggo Mortensen ) befriending a talented black pianist ( Mahershala Ali ) also picked up Globe nomination for both of it actor — “ Black Panther ” managed none — a well a a win for Ali .
 Both “ Green Book ” and “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” have found more favor with audience than with critic , which is exactly the sort of skew the Oscars would prefer : Last summer , the academy infamously flirted with introducing an award for the best popular film , an attempt to pull focus from the critically acclaimed but underseen movie that often comprise much of the best-picture lineup . If “ Green Book ” and “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” are nominated for the Oscars ’ top prize alongside “ A Star Is Born ” and “ Black Panther , ” the academy will be fielding it most populist slate in year .
 And yet I wonder if the Globes ’ real winner wasn ’ t any of those movie but “ Roma , ” Alfonso Cuarón ’ s black-and-white art film . Though it ’ s not the sort of contender that usually win best picture — it wa made in a foreign language and is distributed by the streaming service Netflix — many academy member love the film , and they may be even more inclined to give it their best-picture vote in the wake of Globe victory for “ Green Book ” and “ Bohemian Rhapsody , ” simply to demonstrate that the Oscars have a more highbrow sensibility .
 At a time when the Oscar race often narrow , the Globes have done their part to keep this season wide open .

 WASHINGTON — There wa no golf . There were no meeting . There were no activity , other than a rare visit to church . So President Trump did what he could do : He tweeted .
 Since his election , Mr. Trump ha averaged about 16 tweet per weekend , according to a New York Times analysis of his tweet a collected by the Trump Twitter Archive website . But last weekend proved to be an unusually active 48 hour online for Mr. Trump : From Friday morning to Sunday evening , Mr. Trump tweeted over 50 time , counting the retweets that amplified supporter who have limited public reach on their own .
 Ensconced in the White House , Mr. Trump saw enemy everywhere , and his tweet reflected that , stoking new tension and nursing past grievance .
 He took on “ Saturday Night Live , ” which on March 16 aired a rerun from Christmas , and suggested that the Federal Communications Commission “ look into ” late-night show and examine them for anti-Trump bias . He accused Senator John McCain , who died of brain cancer last year , of collaborating with Democrats and claimed that Mr. McCain , a former prisoner of war , wa “ last in his class ” at the Naval Academy . ( Mr. McCain actually graduated fifth from the bottom . ) And he defended Tucker Carlson and Jeanine Pirro , the Fox News opinion host who have been under fire for making bigoted statement , encouraging Fox executive to “ stay strong ” in the face of criticism .
 Mr. Trump ’ s adviser have shared with him data showing that even his supporter do not like the tweet storm , and have advised him to act more “ presidential ” a his re-election campaign draw nearer . At rally , even die-hard Trump fan who arrive early dressed in “ MAGA ” gear admit that while they are willing to overlook the president ’ s online musing , they would prefer seeing fewer of them .
 Mr. Trump often like to buck the advice he get , and it wa clear over the weekend that he wa trusting his gut again , and going his own way .
 “ Stop working soooo hard on being politically correct , which will only bring you down , and continue to fight for our Country , ” he said in a tweet on Sunday that appeared to be directed at Fox executive who had temporarily removed Ms. Pirro from her Saturday night slot after she suggested that Representative Ilhan Omar , Democrat of Minnesota and one of the first two Muslim woman elected to Congress , may practice Shariah law .
 “ The loser all want what you have , don ’ t give it to them . Be strong & prosper , be weak & die ! ” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter . He also singled out two weekend Fox News anchor , Arthel Neville and Leland Vittert , who are le opinionated than the late-night host who double a the president ’ s personal friend and informal adviser , asking rhetorically whether they were “ trained by CNN prior to their rating collapse . ”
 Later on Sunday , he shared a homemade meme from a little-known Twitter user , who go by the handle @ LonewolfnDuke , which depicted him a “ an American president having to fight an American government to protect American citizen . ”
 But it wa unclear what had provoked the president ’ s flurry of activity , and even adviser were searching for the normal cue that set him off : White House official performing poorly on the Sunday show circuit , or the president ’ s delayed distillation of negative coverage from the week before .
 Mr. Trump on Friday wa rebuked by Senate Republicans , 12 of whom voted with Democrats against a national emergency to build a border wall . But the border barely figured into Mr. Trump ’ s weekend tweet , which appeared to be driven more by idle hand and an empty weekend schedule .
 People who spoke with Mr. Trump on the phone over the weekend said he seemed to be in good spirit . Others who communicated with him said he had spent some time railing privately against Andrew G. McCabe , the former deputy F.B.I . director . But they also said he appeared to be a little aimless , and the outpouring seemed to be more driven by a lack of structure . Mr. Trump had skipped his regular weekend trip to Mar-a-Lago , his Florida estate , because of a family commitment that kept him grounded in Washington .
 There wa a four-hour lull in Mr. Trump ’ s online activity on Sunday , when he left the White House to visit St. John ’ s Church for St. Patrick ’ s Day . But for the most part , the president — bored , agitated or both — appeared to spend the weekend online .
 Mr. Trump shared with his 59.1 million follower a report circulating on right-wing site that Minnesota Democrats had grown unhappy with Ms. Omar , and accused a “ Democrat ” union leader in Ohio of standing in the way of putting an idling General Motors plant in the state back into operation .
 Jack Posobiec , a Trump supporter known for advancing conspiracy theory on Twitter , including “ Pizzagate , ” marveled that his message were being retweeted by the leader of the free world . The president shared two tweet initially sent by Mr. Posobiec , one a local news article about an MS-13 gang stabbing , and another criticizing CNN over a segment examining the link between Mr. Trump and white nationalism .
 “ I realize the president ’ s just reading my Twitter account going through the tweet , ” Mr. Posobiec said in a 13-minute video he posted analyzing the experience . “ Let ’ s see what else he ’ s up to today . ”
 As is often the case , there wa a correlation between what appeared on Mr. Trump ’ s Twitter feed and the programming on Fox News . The weekend tour into conspiracy theory kicked off on Friday , when Mr. Trump elevated a nascent movement that call itself “ Jexodus , ” the brainchild of a conservative Jewish activist that describes itself a a group of “ proud Jewish millennials tired of living in bondage to leftist politics . ”
 “ The ‘ Jexodus ’ movement encourages Jewish people to leave the Democrat Party , ” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter , although there is no evidence to suggest that Jewish voter have been deserting the party . But Mr. Trump appeared to be reacting to an appearance on “ Fox & Friends ” by the group ’ s spokeswoman , Elizabeth Pipko , a former model and Trump 2016 campaign staff member .
 Brian Ott , who study the effect of rhetoric at Texas Tech University and is the author of a book studying Mr. Trump ’ s tweet , said the president appeared to have become le concerned with the consequence of his messaging .
 “ Not only is it already getting worse , ” Dr. Ott said , “ I don ’ t think we ’ ve even seen the tip of the iceberg yet . As these investigation begin to close in on him , really his only play is to stoke vitriol and violence . ”
 Tweeting ha also become a normal part of how the president circumvents the news medium and his own adviser to communicate to the public what is on his mind . But the weekend whirlwind wa so unusual that it created it own mini news cycle , with target using their own platform to respond and aide fielding question from reporter about the president ’ s mental state .
 Kellyanne Conway , counselor to the president , defended him on Monday morning after her husband , George Conway , spent the weekend raising concern about “ Narcissistic Personality Disorder ” and said on Twitter that Mr. Trump ’ s “ condition is getting worse . ”
 “ No , I don ’ t share those concern , ” Ms. Conway told reporter outside the White House .
 Meghan McCain , a host of “ The View ” and the daughter of Mr. McCain , said the attack — which included a presidential retweet of a woman who claimed that “ Millions of Americans truly LOVE President Trump , not McCain ” — only made her feel bad for Mr. Trump ’ s family .
 “ I can ’ t imagine having a father that doe this on the weekend , ” Ms. McCain said .

 A Word With
 By Kathryn Shattuck
 For the last decade — a he snared an Oscar nomination for Steve McQueen ’ s “ 12 Years a Slave , ” swaggered through the National Theater production of “ Everyman ” and wielded magical weapon in Marvel ’ s “ Doctor Strange ” — Chiwetel Ejiofor ha had his mind on other thing .
 When he wasn ’ t racking up accolade in front of the camera , Ejiofor wa figuring out how to step behind it and make a movie about William Kamkwamba , who at 13 saved his Malawi village from drought and famine by building a windmill .
 The result , “ The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind ” — Ejiofor ’ s feature directorial debut , based on Kamkwamba ’ s 2009 best-selling memoir — arrives on Netflix on March 1 a well a in select theater for a weeklong run .
 “ I read it when it first came out and immediately wanted to get the right . I just had a strong instinct , ” Ejiofor said . “ It wa talking about thing that everybody wa dealing with globally ” — democracy , economics , the environment — “ but concentrated on these people who were at the thin end at the wedge . ”
 “ I found a project I loved so deeply that I wa prepared to doggedly stick with over many year , ” he added .
 Born into a farming family , Kamkwamba ( played by Maxwell Simba , with Ejiofor a his father , Trywell ) wa forced to quit high school after his parent couldn ’ t scrape together the tuition . Undeterred , he sneaked into class and the library , where an American textbook called “ Using Energy ” inspired him to use bicycle part to build a windmill to pump water for crop — and in the process keep his village alive a corrupt politician abandoned it .
 Kamkwamba wa unable to return to school for five year , until his invention captivated supporter who helped him gain entry into the African Leadership Academy , and then into Dartmouth , where he graduated in 2014 .
 In an interview at a Lower East Side hotel , Ejiofor , 41 — who is London-based and wa on a work layover between the Sundance and Berlin film festival , where his film captured warm review — spoke about his passion project .
 Here are edited excerpt from the conversation .
 Can you pinpoint the moment when you knew you had to make this movie ?
 I wa very struck by this idea of a 13-year-old sneaking into school , and I considered what my attitude to school wa when I wa 13 — and the idea of how inconceivable it would be that I ’ d have tried to sneak past teacher in order to get into a double math class . For William to find his way through in that kind of situation just seemed extremely hopeful to me .
 You first had to write the screenplay before shooting in 2017 . Did the idea behind his story shift during those year ?
 A lot of these idea became almost more pertinent over time . When I started writing it , there really wasn ’ t a question mark over the nature of democracy in the Western world , so it seemed like a very African issue that this [ corrupt politician ] come along and he ’ s beating people up at rally . By the time we finished the film , these idea of whether there are limit to democracy were everywhere , in the States and with Brexit . There wa also the financial crash , and the idea of deregulation or unregulated market wa all people were talking about . Years later it ’ s so much more a part of how we think about the potential disastrous consequence of some of the action — like looking at a famine that wa really about unregulated grain price .
 As an actor , do you see the scene in your head when you ’ re writing ?
 Yeah , I mean all of it . You hear the scene , you play out the scene . I would be seemingly crazy , walking around playing all the part , just invested in all of the moment of the film .
 What is William doing now ?
 Now he work in North Carolina and in Malawi , and through his organization Moving Windmills , he ’ s setting up an innovation center in Lilongwe [ the capital of Malawi ] to support young people who have idea — innovator , inventor , thinker — and put them in contact with people who could help them actualize their idea .
 Let ’ s talk about some of your other upcoming film . There wa quite a twist with your character , Baron Mordo , at the end of “ Doctor Strange. ” Have you officially signed on to reprise the role in the sequel ?
 [ Laughs ] “ I can neither confirm nor deny ” type thing .
 Hmm . You also have two Disney movie coming out . You ’ re playing Scar , the Jeremy Irons role , in the “ Lion King ” reboot with Beyoncé and Donald Glover . Did you feel any pressure reworking such a beloved film ?
 It ’ s just very exciting . Obviously the original wa so incredible and so sort of legendary . But like anything else , you have to kind of put that to one side and just try and play the part and see what happens .
 Could you maybe slip into your Scar voice for a moment ?
 [ Laughs ] We ’ ll have to wait and hear it .
 How about “ Maleficent 2 ” ? There ’ s a mysterious blank on IMDb where your character should be named , though rumor ha it you ’ re a possible love interest for Angelina Jolie .
 [ Putting on a plummy British accent ] I don ’ t know how much I can say about any of this , really . I actually came to the first “ Maleficent ” quite late . But I wa totally stunned by it and thought it wa such an interesting take on the way that we view fairy tale , and how it imprint u with certain thought and feeling right from a young age that we carry through subconsciously . I think “ Maleficent 2 ” expands that world in a fascinating way . And I ’ d worked with Angelina before [ in “ Salt ” ] and had a great time . She ’ s such a remarkable actress and just a force . It wa very cool .
 “ The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind ” is no fairy tale . You strove for authenticity by having the cast speak the native Chichewa , which required lot of subtitle . Is it a coincidence that it ended up on Netflix , like Alfonso Cuarón ’ s “ Roma , ” another heavily subtitled film ?
 When I started on the process with this film , there were only a few avenue that one could go , and those question are really commercial question because the authenticity would always butt head with this idea of , “ Does that affect the capacity for the film to reach an audience in the West ? ” In the meantime , Netflix arrives with a whole other way of accessing and engaging people . So being able to put the film into a limited release but at the same time allow it to reach a global audience is a kind of wonderful development for a film like this .
 That ’ s what I loved about “ Roma. ” I loved the fact that people have reference point now in a way that they just never did . They couldn ’ t have a conversation about something a detailed and nuanced a the specific of Mexico in the 1970s with anybody and now they really can . They have a place to start a conversation , and that ’ s a big kind of cultural change and ha an impact .
 Having a wider , more informed idea of the world is this very , very powerful possibility .

 THAT CHURCHILL WOMAN By Stephanie Barron 387 pp . Ballantine . $ 28 .
 Romance may be universal , but romance inhabit a more specific realm , bound by genre , juicy and flamboyant in some way , constricted in others . Eyes are forever snapping , bodice unsnapping . This syrupy life of Winston Churchill ’ s effervescent mother , Jennie , exults in it limitation . Jeanette Jerome , a 20-year-old American heiress , wed the aspiring statesman Randolph Henry Spencer Churchill , a marriage straight out of Henry James . Barron describes the wild , lovely Jennie at the piano , where her talent evokes her personality : “ Crashing and furious and exhilarating at once . ”
 This fictionalized account dwells most lovingly on the illicit affair between the heroine , compared by a contemporary to a “ panther , ” and the Austrian Count Charles Kinsky . She fall for his “ whipcord-lean ” physique , blue eye and “ dashing Hussar ” mustache . He delight — if a man can swoon , Kinsky swoon — over her blood-red damask frock from Worth and the Cartier star of diamond that wa her fashion trademark .
 Hubby lurks . “ Randolph reached for her shoulder — white and rounded a a Michelangelo. ” Though Jennie always , but always , wear the best couture , she ’ s more than a fashion plate ; she tear apart her husband ’ s parliamentary speech and reworks them to her own taste .
 Jennie sends Winston to boarding school at age 7 . When he come home for his “ Long Vac , ” she can spare only a moment to inspect the “ brutal scrawl of sharp red line ” from caning across his back . The child is father to the man , but where doe that leave the mother ? In this case absent at a ball , stunning , in Worth .
 THE EULOGIST By Terry Gamble 310 pp . Morrow/HarperCollins . $ 26.99 .
 In 1828 , when this novel commences , Cincinnati is a bustling crossroad with a teeming , polyglot populace and tobacco , indigo and runaway slave flowing up from the South . Fifteen-year-old Olivia arrives from Ireland with her two brother to settle in “ the North ’ s last bastion before the frontier. ” After their mother dy and their father run off , Olivia , James and Erasmus must fend for themselves .
 A young woman of independent mind and progressive moral , Olivia look back on her exciting , subversive youth from the vantage point of her ninth decade . James go into the candle-making business , Erasmus fashion himself an itinerant preacher and Olivia struggle to fit into the female role that ’ s been assigned to her . She hold needlepoint “ in my lap like a sleeping cat , ” knowing she should impress a suitor with her cross-stitched daisy , but can ’ t bring herself to care . Instead she gain entry to the secret world of the human body when she befriends and later marries a doctor and assist in his anatomical research . She also follows Erasmus to camp meeting , which “ might otherwise be a bacchanal , had more liquor been available . ”
 Olivia becomes entwined in antislavery pursuit , first on behalf of a woman named Tilly , setting her up in a hairdressing venture through which she might buy back her freedom , then in a more elaborate scheme involving a wagon filled with hat for sale and an ingeniously concealed , human-size compartment .
 As improbable a some of the particular might be , Gamble seduces with her rich , rollicking portrait of life in Jacksonian Ohio .
 THE PERILOUS ADVENTURES OF THE COWBOY KING By Jerome Charyn 283 pp . Liveright . $ 26.95 .
 Theodore Roosevelt ’ s acerbic daughter Alice suggested that her father wanted to be “ the corpse at every funeral , the bride at every wedding and the baby at every christening. ” To this we must add the hero of every novel . Teddy ’ s cry of “ Ya-ha-hawww ! ” punctuates the prose of “ The Perilous Adventures of the Cowboy King , ” exclamation being the default choice of voice for “ Teedie , ” who narrates his life from his childhood in Manhattan until his elevation to the presidency .
 As a writer/ventriloquist , Charyn ha written work “ by ” Abraham Lincoln and Emily Dickinson , production in which the audience can occasionally see the performer ’ s mouth move . Teddy is a fraught choice for biographical treatment these day , a trustbusting conservationist who wa also a big-game hunter with a dubious view of racial equality , appearing almost buffoonish behind his pince-nez and buck teeth . But Charyn ’ s empathic first-person strategy keep the tone sprightly positive , undercutting the braggadocio with paradoxical self-deprecation . On the celebrated charge of the Rough Riders up San Juan Hill , for example , Teddy loses his eyeglass and can ’ t seem to locate one of the many extra pair that have been sewn into his uniform . He is rescued by an aide with yet another spare pair .
 Yet he is , undeniably , a marvel . As a little boy , he make himself expert at imitating birdsong and keep a seal skull and other artifact in the malodorous “ Teedie Roosevelt Museum of Natural History ” in his bedroom . As an adult , he is “ part cowpoke , part politician. ” Perhaps most telling is his infatuation with a pet cougar named Josephine . “ Ya-ha-hawww ! ”
 MAD BLOOD STIRRING By Simon Mayo 386 pp . Pegasus . $ 25.95 .
 The War of 1812 , bookended by the American Revolution and the Civil War , usually disappears in their shadow , so it ’ s instructive a well a entertaining to find an ambitious novel set at the close of that conflict . A truce ha been declared , yet American sailor find themselves still trapped in Dartmoor , a vicious den of a prison in Devonshire , England . Wicked cold grip the place in the winter of 1814 , and a smallpox epidemic decimates the population . The plot of “ Mad Blood Stirring ” grows from a kernel of historical truth — Mayo provides a full bibliography , in case there ’ s any doubt — but his book dazzle not so much a fact than a fiction .
 Thousands of sailor crowd seven cellblock , one of which is reserved exclusively for African-Americans . There the Dartmoor Amateur Dramatic Company devotes itself to performing the play of Shakespeare . Swashbuckling direction come courtesy of a figure known a King Dick , who asserts with unchallengeable authority that “ Shakespeare wa black. ” “ Romeo and Juliet ” is under production , and on the board an astonished audience will find not only a hazel-eyed Habakkuk ( Habs ) Snow a Romeo but , in the role of Juliet , Joe Hill , “ the most handsome , most righteous , most blackest white boy in the land. ” Danger surround their onstage kiss — it is , in fact , forbidden by the authority , who , in spite of the British naval tradition of “ rum , sodomy and the lash , ” have executed numerous men for “ buggery . ”
 As Shakespeare suggests elsewhere , the course of true love never did run smooth . High drama follows when Habs and Joe fall hard in love on the verge of a devastating prison riot that threatens to tear them apart .
 Jean Zimmerman ’ s most recent novel is “ Savage Girl . ”

 PHNOM PENH , Cambodia — First came the 8,900-pound sticky-rice cake , stuffed with mung bean and pork belly , displayed at Angkor Wat and heralded a “ officially amazing ” by Guinness World Records .
 Then , in rapid succession , came a series of record-setting feat : The largest-ever performance of Madison dancing , with 2,015 participant . The world ’ s longest scarf ( 3,772 foot ) , woven over the course of six month and paraded through the street of Phnom Penh , the Cambodian capital .
 And in November , the world ’ s longest dragon boat ( 286 foot ) wa launched into the Mekong River and rowed by 179 oarsman .
 While this streak of oddball achievement might seem unconnected , they are all part of Prime Minister Hun Sen ’ s push to get young people excited about his aging regime , which he appears to consider essential to maintaining his grip on power .
 “ The government ’ s intention here are rather transparent : They want to create image of visible enthusiasm for the nation and it leadership , ” said Katrin Travouillon , a scholar of Cambodian politics at Australian National University .
 The initial salvo in this campaign wa the rice-and-pork colossus , unveiled at Angkor Wat in 2015 , and touted a a modern-day marvel by the authoritarian Mr. Hun Sen , now 66 , and his son Hun Many , 36 , who hatched the idea a a showcase project for his new pro-government youth group .
 Crowds cheered a a representative from Guinness World Records certified that the rice cake would take it place in the record book alongside Angkor Wat , the world ’ s largest religious structure and a source of enduring national pride .
 “ I am proud to be a child of Cambodia , and today we have achieved a giant sticky-rice cake , and the world will acknowledge that from now on , ” Mr. Hun Many said in a triumphant speech at the event .
 Two-thirds of Cambodia ’ s population is under 30 , with no memory of the Khmer Rouge ’ s bloody rule in the 1970s , or the long year of civil war that followed . Many are weary of their country ’ s international reputation for genocide and political dysfunction .
 So the country ’ s youth are le susceptible to Mr. Hun Sen ’ s traditional message that his party ’ s leader are national hero , deserving perpetual legitimacy because of the role they played helping to oust the Khmer Rouge from power in 1979 .
 The point wa driven home to Mr. Hun Sen in emphatic fashion in 2013 , after a near loss to an insurgent political party in an election that year . He ha spent the past half-decade ramping up his effort to appeal to the nation ’ s youth .
 “ The C.P.P . ha to have recognized by now that a national identity forged on victimhood and gratitude is difficult to reconcile with the idea and aspiration of the younger generation , ” said Ms. Travouillon , referring to the ruling Cambodian People ’ s Party .
 The new narrative emphasizes self-sufficiency and national pride , with Mr. Hun Sen publicly thumbing his nose at the Western donor who have poured billion of dollar of aid into the country .
 A critical plank of this project ha been a revival of the country ’ s youth corp , headed by Mr. Hun Sen ’ s youngest and most affable son , Mr. Hun Many . Officially , it is nonpartisan ; in practice , it activity support the ruling party .
 At a gathering of the youth corp in November , Mr. Hun Many urged participant to continue garnering world record .
 Kim Sok , a political commentator who fled the country last year after serving a jail term for criticizing the prime minister , ha spoken out against the flurry of record attempt .
 He said in an interview from Finland , where he ha been granted asylum , that he could not understand why Guinness would certify record obtained by agent of authoritarian government .
 “ They have people , power and money , and just order the people to spend the money to get a certificate from Guinness World Records and then use this a propaganda , ” he said .
 “ I think this certificate mock the whole nation . ”
 Rachel Gluck , a spokeswoman for Guinness World Records , said the organization made “ every effort possible to remain politically neutral ” and required applicant to “ meet our core value of integrity , respect , inclusiveness and passion . ”
 Mr. Hun Many declined request for an interview about his record-seeking quest .
 But in a speech responding to criticism of his giant cake , scarf and boat a wasteful , he defended the pursuit of record a crucial for promoting Cambodian spirit , at home and abroad .
 “ What did we do it for ? ” he said . “ It ’ s for our flag waving in the world , and there is only one Cambodian flag . ”
 Dr. Travouillon said the rhetoric surrounding these project wa revealing for it focus on unity and cooperation .
 The giant scarf wa heavily promoted in a medium campaign targeting university student , who were encouraged to try their hand at weaving a few strand in the name of national solidarity .
 The sticky-rice cake wa produced after month of divisive street protest and a parliamentary boycott over the result of the 2013 election .
 At the cake ’ s unveiling , Mr. Hun Many proclaimed it had been achieved only through “ a singular spirit . ”
 His father then approached the gargantuan snack alongside Sam Rainsy , the opposition leader , who had run in 2013 on a change-oriented political platform that struck a chord with young people . The men ceremonially cut the rice with a sword , each took a bite and proclaimed a rapprochement .
 But even epic cake have their limit in bridging yawning political divide . After a short period of collaboration , Mr. Hun Sen began a series of lawsuit against Mr. Sam Rainsy that drove him from Cambodia .
 The prime minister later declared the entire opposition party illegal , jailed many politician and activist , and , without any real competition , won the 2018 national election in a landslide .
 Mr. Kim Sok , the commentator , said the sticky-rice cake and other monumental totem of power were depressing reminder of Mr. Hun Sen ’ s authoritarian reach .
 They were also silly , he added .
 “ What is the innovation ? ” he asked of the rice cake . “ It ’ s just making it bigger than normal . Do you think this is talent ? Is it a great idea for the nation ? ”
 Although older Cambodians seemed skeptical , several young people said the world record resonated with them .
 “ I think it ’ s amazing , ” said Man Nisa , a soft-spoken 19-year-old who had ducked out of her university to pick up a new K-pop album she had ordered from a deliveryman on a motorbike . “ I have never seen such achievement . ”
 But the deliveryman , Yin Hong , 35 , a migrant from the countryside , disagreed .
 “ I think it ’ s nonsense ! ” he exclaimed . “ It ’ s a waste of money and doesn ’ t create job for anyone . ”
 He added : “ Other country don ’ t even make sticky-rice cake , but they could probably make a bigger one if they knew the recipe . ”

 Acrobats at Dior , springtime marvel at Chanel and fantastic creature at Iris van Herpen ; the circus come to Paris , and to u all .

 PARIS — Out the woman came , carrying one another on their back . Up the woman went , hoisted by each other ’ s hand . Over their body curved , all different size and strength .
 Maria Grazia Chiuri had hired the all-female acrobatic troupe Mimbre for her Dior show , and they stacked themselves into various innovative kind of human pyramid — under the big top that the brand had raised in the garden of the Rodin Museum — balancing on one another ’ s shoulder , reaching ever higher .
 As an opening act for the couture , the metaphor wa hard to miss .

 Circus lends itself to many situation , the present one not excepted . There ’ s all sort of talk about a clown in the White House . Brexiters are flying without a net . And there ’ s always something a little loop-the-loop about the couture : that part of style that showcase very expensive clothes for the very few . In any case , it ’ s hard to argue with the idea that the world is upside down . You might a well say it with fashion — especially the kind that isn ’ t expected to make sense hanging in a store for the everyday .
 The problem , in Ms. Chiuri ’ s case , is that the theme led her down a creative wormhole to the past , and the kind of collection that paid homage to the circus of vintage postcard fame ( also Dior heritage : remember Avedon ’ s famous 1955 photograph , “ Dovima with Elephants ? ” Ms. Chiuri sure doe ) . So there were crystal-spangled bloomer , and red and black polka-dot corset playsuit ; harlequin ruff and beaded bareback-rider dress . It didn ’ t seem to have much to do with female power after all , except maybe for a troika of pleated Jean Harlow lamé gown , the sort that used to make all viewer go weak at the knee and which should be coming soon to a red carpet near you .
 Still , the fact that this time around Ms. Chiuri ’ s feminism wa implied rather than advertised on T-shirts and poster wa a step forward . That ’ s one of the difference between couture and ready-to-wear ; there ’ s more room in the first for subtlety . Besides , the ringmaster wa a woman : in slick-cut tail and a ruffled sheer white blouse . So wa the lion tamer . And Ms. Chiuri wa not the only designer with somersault and high-wire act on her mind .
 At Schiaparelli , Bertrand Guyon name-checked flower and the intergalactic cosmos , but the result wa like something straight from the costume department of Cirque du Soleil ( When is it going to do a Schiap show ? Can ’ t you just imagine what it could do with the lobster ? ) .
 He made a big puffball with no place for arm and then covered the whole with purple and red feather and christened it “ Meteorid Swarm Cape. ” He molded New Look jacket with structured pannier hip over Bermuda short , all in shocking-pink stiff silk embroidered with gold and mother-of-pearl bloom , topped by an enormous bow and finished with cowboy boot . He sprinkled pastel star on duchesse satin with a giant , face-framing ruffle .
 Though when it come to the frill of the oversize , no one , really , can top Giambattista Valli , who ha made frothing titanic tulle dress his signature . Also high/low dressing : taffeta and moiré frock cut thigh-high in the front , and backed by billowing train , so they make both entrance and exit . And this time , billowing poet ’ s sleeve attached to micro sheath and rendered in silk velvet ( there wa a lot of billowing , though everything came paired with it own little black fez ) .
 Don ’ t even ask if you can sit down in some of these — that ’ s what the understated column with ostrich-feather cuff are for , the cocktail mini-fripperies covered in crystal . Think of it a the Ball-gowned Lady of the Instagram side show . No matter that getting through a doorway might take a contortionist . Or a magician . Presto change-o .
 Enter Iris van Herpen . Probably the most inventive couturier working today — certainly the most modern ( she probably is the only designer ever to work at the CERN particle physic laboratory in Switzerland ) — she also started with classic idea of mythology and cosmology and flying through the star and so on . Then that made her think about DNA engineering and harmonic convergence , and it all became a 3-D printed , laser-cut , algorithm-defined visual universe expertly balanced on the tightrope between creativity and technology : earth angel in filmy layer of organza printed with liquid cloud inspired by the artist and former NASA engineer Kim Keever ; wing of midnight-sky plissé jutting from shoulder ; anamorphic face peeking out of swirling body topography in layer of white .
 When it come to escape artist , however , even P.T . Barnum would have to take his hat off to Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel . It ’ s been snowing in Paris but inside the Grand Palais Mr. Lagerfeld did a flip through the season , building a verdant garden from an 18th-century Mediterranean chateau , complete with an expanse of grass , palm and orange tree , rose bush , gravel path à la française — and a swimming pool .
 Around it swirled long , lean silhouette in springtime pastel with hemline dropped to mid-calf and jacket with broad , softly rounded , shoulder ; garden party frock in organza with feathered bloom scattered across a bell-like skirt of Wedgwood blue ; satin pouf skirt and bouclé bolero top inverted and flipped over on themselves ; and evening train caught up at the waist to reveal the contrasting bow underneath .

 The set wa a marvel of decoration , and so were some of the clothes , including one column dress adorned with real flower preserved in resin . The bride wore a sparkling silver bathing suit and long veil and looked ready to take a plunge into the aqua water . You kind of wanted to jump in with her .
 Though perhaps ultimately the most surreal aspect of the whole thing wa the fact that Mr. Lagerfeld did not appear at the end of the show to take his bow a usual . The brand issued a statement saying : “ Mr . Lagerfeld , Artistic Director of Chanel , who wa feeling tired , asked Virginie Viard , Director of the Creative Studio of the House , to represent him and greet the guest alongside the bride . Virginie Viard a Creative Studio Director and Eric Pfrunder a Chanel ’ s Director of Image continue to work with him and follow through with the brand ’ s collection and image campaigns. ” The absence wa so unprecedented , it ’ s bound to start the rumor mill churning .
 It ’ s one way to make what you read in the paper every morning disappear .

 LONDON — Six month after agent from Saudi Arabia murdered and dismembered the writer Jamal Khashoggi , company are no longer shying away from the Arab kingdom .
 The movie theater giant AMC say it is moving ahead with ambitious expansion plan for dozen of cinema there . Hundreds of investor thronged last week to place $ 100 billion in order for the first international bond sale tied to Saudi Arabia ’ s state-backed oil company . Google ha a major data center in the work .
 Many company contend that they are , in part , helping to open up the deeply conservative society . A screening of Marvel ’ s “ Black Panther ” at a repurposed concert hall in early 2018 lifted a 35-year ban on movie theater , with men and woman attending the showing together .
 But the math is simple : There is serious money to be made from working with the kingdom that life off the world ’ s most profitable company , Aramco . A few week ago , Aramco disclosed that it generated $ 111.1 billion in net income last year . That wa more than Apple , Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil combined .
 “ It is nothing personal , ” J. Robinson West , the managing director of the BCG Center for Energy Impact , a Washington-based consulting unit , said about why investor and bank flocked to the bond sale . “ It ’ s just business . ”
 To corporation around the world , the October death of Mr. Khashoggi , a columnist for The Washington Post who wa strangled when he entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul , wa a controversy to avoid . Business leader pulled out of a high-profile , government-sponsored conference in Riyadh , and have since largely kept quiet about their company ’ tie to the kingdom .
 But global business and Saudi Arabia ’ s de facto ruler , Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman , recognize a need for each other .
 Saudi Arabia ’ s fortune fall and rise with the price of oil . Increasingly , it want fresh investment and business to support it fast-growing population — 33 million people , most of whom are younger than 30 — and to winnow a nearly 13 percent unemployment rate .
 The crown prince rolled out a grand promotional campaign in 2016 to woo investor , but the result have been meager . Direct foreign investment fell to a decade low in 2017 , just $ 1.4 billion , according to the Institute for International Finance , a research organization in Washington .
 Investment fell , in part , because of concern about how the kingdom — which increasingly mean Prince Mohammed — confronts problem . In fall 2017 , hundred of Saudi businessmen and prince were detained , essentially under house arrest , at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Riyadh and other location amid corruption allegation .
 About a dozen female activist were arrested in May for campaigning for broader right , including driving . Some are still being held on “ suspicion of harming Saudi interest , ” and their court hearing have been delayed multiple time , including this week .
 “ Things certainly got worse after the fall of 2017 and have not significantly improved , ” said Karen Young , a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington , referring to investment level .
 But the promise of Saudi Arabia , which saw oil price rise by a third this year to about $ 71 a barrel for Brent crude , ha been too rich for many big company to pas up . Google , JPMorgan Chase and the Japanese technology giant SoftBank are among the business that have kept Saudi Arabia a a partner .
 “ We thought long and hard , and concluded that the best course of action wa to go forward , ” Adam Aron , the chief executive of AMC , said in an interview , describing his company ’ s decision to open at least 40 new theater there over the next five year .
 “ It ’ s the right thing to do for the people of Saudi Arabia , ” he said this month . “ They have been deprived of going to the movie for decade . ”
 Google ha been working on a Saudi data center , it first in the Middle East and an important hub for it cloud computing service , for more than a year . Revelations about Mr. Khashoggi ’ s killing had not derailed it plan . When asked about it business with the kingdom , Google said it had signed a memo of understanding with Saudi Aramco in early 2018 “ to explore potential establishment of cloud service to serve our customer in the Middle East . ”
 “ There are no further update to share at this time , ” the company added .
 JPMorgan ’ s chief executive , Jamie Dimon , canceled an appearance at the Riyadh conference in October , but showed up to pitch Saudi Aramco ’ s bond deal to investor in New York two week ago .
 The investment firm Blackstone is still planning to spend money from a $ 40 billion infrastructure fund , of which $ 20 billion is meant to come from Saudi coffer , according to a person briefed on the matter who wa not authorized to speak publicly about the firm ’ s investment plan .
 And SoftBank , whose nearly $ 100 billion Vision Fund for technology investment count the Saudi government a it biggest backer , ha had little difficulty crafting deal using Saudi cash . It ha participated in 20 investment since the Khashoggi news emerged , according to data from S & P Global Market Intelligence .
 Some analyst said that floating Aramco ’ s bond wa a shrewd move by the crown prince .
 Aramco raised $ 12 billion from it first-ever bond offering on the international market . Investors placed ten of billion of dollar in order on the same day that the State Department barred 16 Saudis from the United States , for their suspected role in killing Mr. Khashoggi .
 “ Everyone in Saudi will be celebrating that they have actually pulled this through and made it a success story , ” Ayham Kamel , head of Middle East at Eurasia Group , a political risk firm , said of the bond deal .
 Many Western company were tight lipped about their continued investment in Saudi Arabia for week after Mr. Khashoggi disappeared .
 But in November , SoftBank ’ s chief executive , Masayoshi Son , publicly articulated what many corporate titan have quietly used a their justification for working with the kingdom . “ As horrible a this event wa , we can not turn our back on the Saudi people a we work to help them in their continued effort to reform and modernize their society , ” Mr . Son told analyst and investor at an earnings presentation in Tokyo
 Companies have also taken cue from the Trump administration , which ha repeatedly stressed that it considers the crown prince a crucial ally in a long-awaited Middle East peace proposal and other issue .
 Saudi Arabia is likely to be active , not only a a place to invest but a a borrower and an investor . The country ’ s sovereign wealth fund , the Public Investment Fund , ha assembled a nearly $ 300 billion portfolio of asset that includes stake in technology company like Uber and the electric carmaker Lucid .
 Its chief , Yasir al-Rumayyan , said in February that the fund planned to open investment office in New York and San Francisco a it stepped up investment .
 Still , some company have decided to back away .
 Endeavor , the Hollywood talent agency , returned a $ 400 million investment from the Saudis this year and severed it relationship with the kingdom ’ s leader . The British entrepreneur Richard Branson , who returned from a 2017 visit to the kingdom wowed by Prince Mohammed ’ s vision , recoiled after Mr. Khashoggi ’ s murder . Mr. Branson suspended his directorship in Saudi tourism venture and cut off conversation with the Public Investment Fund .
 In the unlikely event that more Western company follow suit , the kingdom ha a contingency plan : working increasingly with ally in Asia .
 Countries including China , South Korea and Thailand have become key customer for the Saudis a the United States reduces it dependence on imported oil because of domestic shale production .
 In turn , the Chinese oil giant Sinopec ha become a high-profile investor in the kingdom , with a refining joint venture with Aramco and a research and development facility at a science park called Dhahran Techno Valley , in eastern Saudi Arabia . The science park represents an effort by the Saudis to create a technology hub around Aramco and the nearby King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals .
 Other company listed a tenant on the park ’ s website include Halliburton , Honeywell , Schlumberger , Emerson Electric , General Electric and Baker Hughes , a G.E . company .
 On Monday , Aramco said it wa spending $ 1.25 billion for a stake in Hyundai Oil Bank , a South Korean refiner , creating what it called a “ dedicated outlet ” for Saudi crude .
 The question now is whether and how Saudi Arabia can use the momentum from the Aramco bond sale . “ For people to invest in Saudi Arabia , they need a belief that this country is moving in the right direction , ” said Roger Diwan , a vice president at IHS Markit , a research firm . “ The last 12 month have not been stellar . ”
 An earlier version of this article misstated the given name of the Eurasia Group ’ s head of Middle East . He is Ayham Kamel , not Ayahm .

 Cherry Point sits on Manhattan Avenue in Greenpoint , a few step from the corner where Bedford Avenue , having flowed all the way across Brooklyn from the shore of Sheepshead Bay , suddenly come to an end . The area is marked by a cluster of restaurant . Some have a washed-up feeling , a if they ’ d all been drifting along in Bedford ’ s current and had been stranded there . A few stand out in the landscape .
 In the fall , Cherry Point took a decisive turn into the second category when a new chef took over , but not everyone in the neighborhood seems to realize it yet . People still tumble in for happy hour , when server whose hairstyle take a minute to adjust to will pour three-gulp martini , manhattan and Rob Roys ( due for a revival ) in little Nick & Nora glass for $ 8 each , and then after happy hour end at 7 p.m. most of the crowd generally drift out to find somewhere else for dinner . The space , with it old-timey wainscoting and it central bar , is easy to mistake for a tavern .
 Let ’ s say you were among those who stayed put . Contemporaneously with your cocktail , you worked on a few smoked olive , green and warm ; swirled a few of the golden , bite-size pig ’ s head croquette in a pale-pinkish ketchup made from pear ; and became curious about what else this kitchen wa up to . At one point you noticed that the dining room suddenly smelled like an herb garden in August , and a minute later Belon oyster on a nest of smoking rosemary branch sailed out of the kitchen opening that light up the back of the restaurant . You ordered a plate of your own because you wanted to know how the warm oyster would taste under their yellow blanket of smoked rosemary hollandaise .
 From a short list of charcuterie you chose the squab and pork terrine , with a few prune embedded into the pink and pleasingly coarse-grained slab . You spread this on toast with creamy whole-grain mustard , apricot-ginger mostarda or some of the pear ketchup , all of them made on the premise , like the pearl onion pickled in beer and the terrine itself . And you might have thought : If these are just the snack , what is the food going to be like when this kitchen get down to business ?
 Whatever happens , odds are there will be meat on the table . Cherry Point opened in 2016 , taking over what had been a Polish restaurant called Cinamoon . The charcuterie wa made on site from the start , but the menu swerved in a more meat-focused and English-leaning direction last fall when Ed Szymanski wa hired a the chef . This might have been predicted , if not from Mr. Szymanski ’ s English upbringing and British citizenship , then from his work history . He ha cooked at the Beatrice Inn , where various beast of air and land are posed on silver platter for their role in a fall-of-Rome spectacle ; the Spotted Pig , in the day when it wa still known for burger basted in Roquefort and toast buried under chopped chicken liver ; and Pitt Cue , a London outpost of the modern , urbanized barbecue genre .
 For a panoramic tour of Mr. Szymanski ’ s accumulated meat wisdom , you could call two day ahead and reserve a game-and-beef dinner , $ 65 for at least four course along the line of grilled tongue on watercress . The everyday menu , though , is not exactly made up of grain bowl .
 On any given night , you can drop in and marvel at the fried lamb rib , their apple glaze augmented by broken coriander and fennel seed and raw curl of shallot . The quail will be butterflied , grilled over charcoal and served on toast , with pickled prune above it and a reduction swirled with port below . The duck breast will be seared down until the skin is a thin brown sheet next to pink and juicy meat . This is served with roasted , puréed celery root and brûléed pear .
 The plate are marked by a refinement and moderation that is not always achieved by other chef in the guts-and-fat school of cookery . A creamy pheasant , leek and bacon pie is sealed inside a cast-iron pot by a beauty of a suet crust — lacquered , scored in a starburst and very tender . Care is even lavished on the grilled rib-eye for two , which come to the table with neatly sawed length of bone marrow under a tidy crust of parsley , chive , pickle shallot and buttered bread crumb .
 Mr. Szymanski doe not gesture toward fish and vegetable very often , but when he doe he generally muster some conviction . True , the roasted pumpkin mash with toasted hazelnut and fresh cheese ha an obligatory air , a doe the grilled bread with labneh and honey . But the smoked whitefish salad , with caramelized shallot and crème fraîche and a side of saltine , is more energetic than you might guess .
 Grilled flatbread look out of place on this menu , but it is a fine canvas for roasted hens-of-the-woods and other wild mushroom that are fleshy and flavorful enough to get noticed on their own . Skate , a main course , come with smoked German butterball potato and a soaring , fino sherry-laced beurre blanc . The salad of radicchio and other bitter lettuce is a crisp and refreshing a any plate of leaf can be in February . It is also a very good thing to eat with steak , a it happens .
 Anyone who ha not caught on to the English theme so far will get a last chance with the dessert menu , which offer treacle tart , sticky toffee pudding , a posset and three cheese , all from England . The treacle tart wa dry when I had it . The sticky toffee pudding wa surprisingly but not unpleasantly cakelike . The posset , though , is a small miracle , an eggless custard of sugar , lemon juice and cream scented with Earl Grey tea , dressed up with Cara Cara orange wedge and a few Earl Grey meringue . There should be more posset around town . There should be posset galore .
 And by the way , there should be more wine list like Cherry Point ’ s . Assembled by Garret Smith , who owns the restaurant with Vincent Mazeau , it consistently favor obscure and surprising over familiar and dull . By the bottle , there are oddity such a apple wine and mead , but also a few thing you might have heard of : a cremant d ’ Alsace from Dirler Cadé , a Sybille Kuntz riesling , an Olga Raffault chinon and a lean , exact pinot noir from Enderle & Moll . Only two bottle , both sparkling wine , are over $ 100 , and most of the others are closer to $ 50 .
 At these price , you could just close your eye and pick something , which is lucky because the server , though charming and truly unpretentious , haven ’ t fully internalized the list ’ s in and out . It ’ s one of the way in which Cherry Point seems not to have caught up yet with how good it ha become .
 If you treat it like a bar , you might not notice . But if you eat the way I did , ordering half the menu at a time , you could be putting more stress on the infrastructure than it can handle . You might be in for a very slow meal . But it will also be a very good meal .

 I don ’ t want to focus on how rape changed me . I want to focus on changing rape culture .
 By Sharma Shields
 Ms. Shields is a novelist .
 Obsessed with mythology a a girl , I read and reread the “ Book of Greek Myths , ” by Ingri and Edgar Parin d'Aulaire . I fell in love with Artemis — her lack of sentimentality , her plea to Zeus to never have to marry . I even admired her assassination of Actaeon , the man who spied on her a she bathed . She splashed him with water and turned him into a stag ; he wa devoured by his own hound . The book call her “ a cold and pitiless goddess , ” but to me she wa self-assured , unapologetically powerful .
 In fourth grade , then fifth , I dorked out in the forest behind our farmhouse after school , wielding a plastic bow and hiding in the tree whenever a car passed by . Every now and again I declared to no one , “ I shall not marry ! ” I wa a friend to wild animal and an enemy of insolent men . My mind spiraled open , ablaze with transformation , woman to tree , woman to white deer , woman to spider . Metamorphosis and power .
 While reading my favorite book , I wondered about the word “ rape , ” a in the Rape of Persephone . I lingered over the illustration of her descent into the yawning pit , Hades ’ arm securing her to the chariot . Above , in a blue dress , searching and despairing , wa the faint figure of Demeter , the woebegone mother . I thought I understood what rape meant : When someone doe something unwanted .
 In sex ed class we watched a cartoon of an older man looming over a young girl . Your bathing suit cover your private part . There wa a rumor floating around about wicked thing that happened to girl who walked around too stupidly on lonely street at night . Kicking and screaming in cold stairwell . That word again : rape . We giggled nervously . It felt like a sick joke .
 None of this prepared me for what a boy would do to me when I wa 14 and he wa 17 . This wa the moment of my own metamorphosis — one moment I wa someone , the next , someone else . Like Persephone , like Daphne , I wa changed utterly by a desire that in no way reflected my own . The coldness that followed wa more Pygmalion than Apollonian , more marble than wood . I told myself I felt nothing because nothing had happened . It didn ’ t even occur to me to call it rape . I ’ m still unwilling to say it aloud , a if it give him power over me , when I want rather to put my foot to his throat and tell him , Give it back .
 I ’ ve been revisiting the d ’ Aulaires ’ text , still a staple of school library , sharing it with my child . They , too , have their favorite . My daughter love Athena and Arachne ; my son , the Minotaur and Medusa . One evening I found myself reading aloud , “ Daphne would rather be an unmoving tree than the bride of the great god Apollo , but all the other nymph loved to sit at his foot and listen to his enchanting music , and were very honored when he or any of the other great Olympian god chose one of them a a bride . ”
 In other word : Trust u , plenty of babe are jonesing for these fine dude .
 “ You know what , ” I told my son , age 9 , and my daughter , age 6 . “ I don ’ t agree with this at all . ”
 We talked , a we have before , about consent , about their ownership over their own body . I didn ’ t go in depth with them about the euphemism of “ bride ” for “ sexual partner , ” but it ’ s irritating . No wonder I felt so little for Daphne until I wa old enough to recognize the familiarity of her desperation . No wonder I thought Hera wa a jerk , Persephone a ditz . The book that told their story also derided them .
 Artemis wa a cold and pitiless goddess .
 Even Medusa , who wa my gateway into mythology and monstrousness , is dumbed-down by the d ’ Aulaires . Ovid ’ s “ Metamorphoses ” recount the birth of Medusa ’ s hideousness : She is raped by Poseidon in Athena ’ s temple . Like many abuser , Poseidon face no personal consequence . Athena can ’ t reach him with her wrath — he is too powerful , even for a goddess — and so she ruin Medusa instead . Snakes for hair , reptile skin , a repulsiveness that render her not only undesirable but dangerous . In the d ’ Aulaires ’ recounting , Medusa ’ s back story is ignored ; Perseus cut off her ugly head while she sleep . He us a mirror to guide his stroke — a mirror that reflects the victim and not the perpetrator .
 After my own metamorphosis — a virgin , then not — I called the 17-year-old to break up with him .
 “ You ’ re stupid , ” he said , laughing . “ You ’ re immature . You don ’ t just break up with someone because you ’ re unhappy . ”
 The word paralyzed me . Around him I grew murderously watchful , even a I let him do thing to me I didn ’ t want . There wa horror there but also a disturbing curiosity . He ’ d already taken everything , so what else could he do to me ?
 My mom , like Demeter , stomped overhead , calling my name . She sensed I wa gone , that something major wa amiss . “ Get out of this , ” she said . “ Get away from him. ” She wa worried I loved him , that I ’ d marry him and ruin my life .
 I laughed at her . Love him ? I hated him . I told her to leave me alone , but now I look at the picture of the girl being dragged into the underworld and I marvel that my mom reached for me a immediately a she did . I scowled and rebuffed her but I heard her , too . Someone wa fighting for me , her voice faint above the gray bank where I wandered , and I wa le alone for it .
 Soon I turned 15 . A couple of month later , the boy boasted to me that he wa sleeping with a woman his own age , and I broke it off with him officially this time , sobbing not from grief but from humiliation . My girlhood lay dead in a cold blue room , a room I never wanted to revisit , but I woke up the following morning grateful to be free .
 In the d ’ Aulaires ’ book , Pan try to rape the nymph Syrinx . When she escape by turning herself into a reed , Pan pluck 10 reed from the ground and creates the first panpipe , declaring it “ the melodious voice of his beloved . ”
 I wa lucky enough to keep my voice . I started writing . In my fiction I ’ ve drowned one rapist and shot another . In my last book , the rapist get away with it , a most do .
 But what I really want is a different kind of metamorphosis , to be not the woman altered but the woman altering . What will it take for u to toss the water onto the rapist ’ head , to watch assured a they flee , the blood-mouthed hound — guilt , say , or responsibility — snapping behind them ? It is not the violence of such a scene that attracts me , but the righteousness . Artemis wa a cold and pitiless goddess . She knew — or learned — where to place the blame .
 Sharma Shields is the author of the forthcoming novel “ The Cassandra . ”

 Let u help you start your day .

 ( Want to get this briefing by email ? Here ’ s the sign-up . )
 Good morning .
 Boeing simulator test reveal more detail about doomed flight , Cyclone Idai displaces hundred of thousand of people and China alters “ Bohemian Rhapsody. ” Here ’ s the latest :
 During test last week that recreated the scenario on the doomed Lion Air flight in October , pilot discovered they had le than 40 second to override a new automated system on the 737 Max 8 jet .
 The test simulated a single sensor failing , which triggered software designed to help prevent a stall . To keep the plane from going into an unrecoverable nosedive in le than a minute , the pilot had to make a series of rapid-fire control change .
 The pilot in the test succeeded , but they had a good understanding of how the system worked . In the Lion Air crash , pilot who had not been alerted to the system tried more than two dozen time to override the plane ’ s automated response .
 Software update : Boeing is expected to propose change to give pilot more control of the system and make it le likely to trigger erroneously , according to three people familiar with the matter .
 Next : A Senate committee will question U.S. aviation regulator on Wednesday about the approval process for the Boeing 737 Max 8 jet , and why they agreed with Boeing that pilot didn ’ t need to be trained on the new system .
 Cyclone Idai , which delivered heavy rain , flood and wind to Mozambique , Zimbabwe and Malawi , created a crisis on par with those in war-torn Yemen , Syria and South Sudan , according to the U.N .
 At least 600,000 people have been displaced , water and food are in short supply , and the first case of cholera are being reported by the Red Cross .
 Death toll are uncertain , and the extent of the storm ’ s damage is still emerging . In Mozambique , which wa especially hard hit , the government estimate that at least 400 people have died .
 How you can help : Here ’ s a list of aid organization that have begun a broad effort to provide food , shelter and medicine to those affected by the cyclone .
 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , on his way back to Israel from Washington to confront an escalating conflict with Hamas , said that President Trump ’ s recognition of Israel ’ s sovereignty over the Golan Heights set a precedent for territory captured during war .
 “ When you start war of aggression , you lose territory , do not come and claim it afterwards . It belongs to u , ” he said . “ Everyone say you can ’ t hold an occupied territory , but this prof you can . If occupied in a defensive war , then it ’ s ours . ”
 The remark will most likely sway right-wing Israelis in general election in two week . It could also pave the way for the annexation of part of the occupied West Bank .
 Context : Israel seized the Golan Heights from Syria during the Six-Day War in 1967 . By contrast , Israel contends that the West Bank wasn ’ t part of any sovereign state before the country captured it , also in 1967 , and therefore considers it a disputed territory rather than occupied .
 A poll in Israel found that 42 percent of voter support the annexation of part of the West Bank , even those who support a two-state solution with Palestine .
 One of China ’ s most prestigious university started an investigation into a law professor who published a series of essay warning of heavy-handed repression under President Xi Jinping .
 Prof. Xu Zhangrun of Tsinghua University in Beijing published a passionate essay last summer denouncing Mr. Xi ’ s authoritarian tendency that wa widely shared across the country , despite censorship in China .
 Why it matter : Tsinghua University is an internationally reputable school that draw foreign academic and donor , making Professor Xu ’ s case a warning sign abroad about the ruling party ’ s tightening control on dissent .
 Canada : The country granted asylum to a Filipino woman who in 2013 briefly opened her Hong Kong apartment to Edward Snowden , the former National Security Agency contractor who revealed some of the U.S. ’ s most closely guarded surveillance program . She and her daughter arrived on Monday , and they are to live in Montreal .
 Cardinal Pell : Dozens of prominent news outlet and journalist in Australia have been ordered to answer accusation that they violated a gag order barring coverage of the trial of Cardinal Pell , a former Vatican official who wa convicted in December of molesting child . They will appear in court on April 15 .
 Australia : Two official from the country ’ s anti-immigration One Nation party said recording of them discussing how the party could “ own ” the Australian Senate and House of Representatives with a $ 20 million donation from the American gun lobby shouldn ’ t be taken seriously because they had taken place after “ a few drink . ”
 Samsung : The South Korean electronics giant warned that it would report disappointing financial result because of slumping price for chip and LCD screen amid “ weakening overall demand . ”
 Taliban : Five men held at the U.S. detention camp at Guantánamo Bay for 13 year now sit across the negotiating table from their captor in talk over the U.S. troop withdrawal from Afghanistan , a twist that underscore the winding , contradictory nature of America ’ s longest war .
 The Sacklers : The family , which owns Purdue Pharma , the producer of the opioid OxyContin , will pay nearly $ 275 million to settle a closely watched lawsuit brought by the state of Oklahoma that accused the company of igniting the opioid crisis . And major museum , including the National Portrait Gallery and the Tate in London and the Guggenheim in New York , are turning down donation from the family ’ s prominent charity .
 Inside The Times : The photographer Christopher Payne spent two year capturing the marvel and unexpected beauty of our printing plant in New York , where machine the size of large house churn out newspaper .
 China : The version of “ Bohemian Rhapsody , ” the Queen biopic , screening in the country omits several scene , including one in which the band ’ s lead singer , Freddie Mercury , tell his fiancée that he ’ s not straight .
 Perspective : In an essay for our Well section , a senior at Yale argues that the college admission scandal and the lawsuit against Harvard have special resonance for Asian-Americans like herself , whose parent often make great sacrifice of time and money for their child ’ s education .
 Tips for a more fulfilling life .
 Recipe of the day : Craving pasta ? Ricotta cheese gnocchi with brown butter and sage is a good way to go .
 The key to overcoming procrastination is to understand that it ’ s not the result of laziness or mismanaging time , but of avoiding unpleasant emotion .
 Horticulture therapy — gardening — can help hospital patient recover .
 “ Boeing ” is synonymous with airplane — though maybe it should be spelled Böing .
 William Boeing , the company ’ s founder , wa the son of a German immigrant-turned-lumber-tycoon , and seems to have inherited his father ’ s business acumen in addition to the Americanized version of their family name .
 According to Mr. Boeing ’ s biography on the company ’ s website , he started flying a a hobby around 1915 and quickly felt that airplane could make a worthwhile business .
 “ Convinced that there wa a definite future in aviation , I became interested in the construction a well a the flying of aircraft , ” he once told an interviewer .
 That interest eventually led to the Boeing Airplane Company , which initially focused on military plane but ha long been known for it commercial aircraft .
 Mr. Boeing left his namesake company in 1934 to pursue work in other industry , including lumber , real estate , horse breeding and livestock farming , though he continued consulting for Boeing for the rest of his life .

 News Analysis
 By Ellen Barry
 LONDON — It ’ s Wednesday morning . Theresa May ’ s career is over , a a glance at the morning paper will confirm .
 Her Brexit deal , the product of two and a half year of agonizing negotiation , ha been rejected by a margin of 230 vote , in the worst defeat in British history . “ No Deal … No Hope … No Clue … No Confidence , ” declares the Mirror . The Sun photoshops her face onto the body of a dodo .
 Now it ’ s Wednesday afternoon . Hey ! She ’ s back !
 [ What is Brexit ? A simple guide to why it matter and what happens next . ]
 The Labour Party is making a bid to dissolve the government . Leaping to Mrs. May ’ s defense like gallant knight are fellow Tories , among them many who have spent the last few month plotting to remove her .
 “ She personifies duty , she is a patriot and a servant of our country , ” said one . Another praised her “ inspirational leadership. ” Yet another predicted that “ her stock in this country will rise dramatically . ”
 This is the bizarro world that is British politics , a Groundhog Day in which Mrs. May awakes every day to discover herself in a dire political crisis , and every day survives , in her grim , implacable way .
 The rallying of Tories against Labour ’ s bid to bring down the government , which wa defeated by a margin of 19 vote , did it again , the thing that had seemed impossible : It put wind into her sail .
 “ She is indestructible , ” wrote Tom Peck , a sketch writer for the Independent , reflecting on the event of the day . “ She is the cockroach in nuclear winter . She is the algae that survives on sulphuric gas from subaquatic volcano , seven mile beneath the daylight . She is the Nokia 5210 . ”
 Mrs. May rarely give any sense of being chastened by a defeat , plowing ahead in the manner that earned her the nickname “ Maybot . ”
 Stewart McDonald , a member of the Scottish National Party , grilled her on Wednesday for sign that she wa ready to reconsider her Brexit strategy . She did not comply , responding with a set of now-familiar , automatic phrase , like “ deliver Brexit for the British people , ” which sent Mr. McDonald into a spasm of frustration .
 Nobody know , really . But these are the likeliest scenario .
 “ I ’ m trying to be helpful to the prime minister , believe it or not , but this is pure robotic fantasy , ” Mr. McDonald said . He grumbled about it later on Twitter , writing : “ I tried . But ala , the robot within the PM kicked in and she stuck to her script . ”
 The day provided a number of surreal moment that tested the nation ’ s storied capacity for calm .
 At one point , Parliament broke away from the nonstop Constitutional brush fire surrounding Brexit — The Guardian chose to augment it masthead on Wednesday with a reproduction of Edvard Munch ’ s “ The Scream ” — to address an obscure motion banning the excessively low positioning of letter box .
 Postmen complain that low letter box can cause back pain or even , occasionally , hand injury , explained a lawmaker , Vicky Ford , who noted with admiration that several European country also regulate the size of letter box “ aperture . ”
 “ I hope this will be a moment of unity in British politics , ” she said brightly .
 Ten minute , and it wa back to the meltdown of British democracy .
 As Conservative lawmaker lined up to express their loyalty to Mrs. May , Vicki Young , the BBC ’ s chief political correspondent , marveled at their pivot from the day before , when many among them had been gleefully plotting to sink her hard-won Brexit deal .
 Their circling of the wagon , she concluded , wa “ tribal. ” As frustrated a they are with Mrs. May , Conservatives are desperate to avoid a change of government that would put Jeremy Corbyn , the head of the Labour Party , in office .
 Many of them feel sympathy for her , a well , believing that she wa given an impossible task .
 “ It feel like a parallel universe , doesn ’ t it , considering where we were last night , just 24 hour ago , ” she said . “ I have to say , looking at the scene in the last half-hour or so , it ’ s the most united the Conservative bench have been , probably , for month . ”
 A notable tribute to Mrs. May came from Conservative lawmaker Mark Francois , a leader of the arch-Brexiteer European Research Group .
 Mr. Francois , in November , submitted a scathing letter to the party ’ s 1922 committee , which ha the power to remove the party leader , saying Mrs. May “ just doesn ’ t listen ” and is “ in complete denial. ” Since then , he ha missed no opportunity to criticize her deal , which he described a “ rancid , ” and complained that , instead of submitting the deal to a vote , member of her government had “ gone and run away and hidden in the toilet . ”
 On Wednesday , Mr. Francois stood in her defense , acknowledging , to widespread laughter , that “ she and I have not seen entirely eye to eye in the past . ”
 “ But I am a Conservative first and last , and I know opportunism when I see it , ” he said . “ I can tell you , when the bell ring , the whole of the ERG will walk through the lobby with her , to vote this nonsense down . ”
 The failed challenge to Mrs. May ’ s leadership came at just the right time , drawing attention away from the dismal failure of her Brexit bill , said Nikki da Costa , a former Downing Street staffer who now work a senior counsel for the Cicero Group , a consulting firm .
 “ Without a doubt , it is a wonderful distraction , ” she said . “ It move the news story forward very , very quickly . ”
 It doe not , however , resolve the matter at hand .
 On the heel of her crushing defeat on Tuesday , Mrs. May vowed to forge a deal that could win passage , but declined to offer specific .
 There is speculation that she could seek a postponement of the March 29 deadline , and agree to keep a permanent custom union with the European bloc . She said on Wednesday that she would invite opposition party leader to discus a compromise , but Mr. Corbyn asked her to first rule out leaving the European Union without any agreement .
 When historian relate the story of Brexit , they may not even recall Tuesday ’ s epic defeat a the most important event of the week . One thing is certain : Mrs. May ’ s survival provides a certain ballast a this process move forward , Ms. da Costa said .
 “ As the year go by , and the 24-hour news cycle pass , it will be interesting to know which bit stand in the memory , ” she said . “ Certainly the number for her defeat were very , very big yesterday . The fact that she is still standing suggests a strange form of stability . ”
 An earlier version of this article misidentified the party affiliation of Stewart McDonald . He is a member of the Scottish National Party , not the Scottish Labour Party .

 If you ever doubt the value that humanity ha placed on the fermented juice of the grape , take a look at the labor-intensive , death-defying challenge that people have accepted to tend vine on some of the most perilous hillside in the world .
 Whether in the Mosel Valley of Germany , the Northern Rhône Valley of France or Ribeira Sacra in northwestern Spain , to name a few , farmer since ancient time have embraced the idea that wine is worth the enormous effort and possible hazard that go along with such precarious vineyard .
 These are area that have been farmed for century without the aid of mechanization . Diverse society concluded that good wine required both risk and sweat . Not that machinery would have mattered . Even today , these sort of vineyard must be farmed by hand , though getting to them now take far le time .
 Very much in this discussion are the hillside vineyard of Valtellina in the Lombardy region of northern Italy , where the Italian border with Switzerland bisects the Alps .
 In sunny south-facing valley , grape have been cultivated on steep , terraced slope for 2,000 year or more . Nowadays , the grape of choice is chiavennasca , better known to the rest of the world a nebbiolo .
 Here at Wine School , we can ’ t look at a bottle of Valtellina ( or Mosel or Cornas , for that matter ) without marveling at the sheer determination of it maker to overcome danger , nature and the limit of human endurance in the pursuit of good wine . It is why we emphatically do not subscribe to the oft-repeated saw : “ All that matter is what ’ s in the glass . ”
 We will stipulate , of course , that the wine ha to be good . Using an enticing story to sell poor wine is among the oldest of marketing technique . That ’ s why good wine requires from consumer not just the ability to discern it worth , but also to know it context in order to understand it meaning . Otherwise it ’ s just point on a scale , and where ’ s the joy in that ?
 For the last month , we have been exploring Valtellina , pretty much without the context . This led at least one reader , Paul , to question the point of Valtellina , given that one could just a easily be drinking more famous , higher-status wine made of nebbiolo .
 “ Why wouldn ’ t I just purchase Barolo or Barbaresco ? ” he asked .
 This is an excellent question , directly pertinent to all we do at Wine School .
 The place where grape are grown and the people who tend the vineyard and make the wine are crucial to the nature of the wine . These influence contribute to the notion of terroir , which hold that certain place have specific , sometimes unique characteristic that give a wine it particular identity .
 Ancient people recognized place that could make the best , most distinctive wine . This wa part of the motivation to trudge up steep hillside day after day to tend vine .
 These day , certain grape like chardonnay are grown internationally , far from their place of origin . It ’ s essential to ask , like Paul , why one should buy a chardonnay from the Sonoma Coast or Meursault when one can buy a much cheaper California chardonnay from the fertile , irrigated field of the Central Valley .
 How you answer that question depends on your priority . For not much money , the Central Valley chardonnay may well be pleasant , but it won ’ t offer much character . The bottle from the Sonoma Coast and Meursault will cost a lot more . But if they are good , they each have the potential to encourage sens of wonder . This is where priority , discernment and context all come in .
 As always , I suggested three good example of the wine . The Valtellinas I recommended were : Ar.Pe.Pe Rosso di Valtellina 2014 , Sandro Fay Valtellina Superiore Valgella Cà Moréi 2015 and Aldo Rainoldi Valtellina Superiore Grumello 2015 .
 These were three excellent yet very different expression of Valtellina . The Rosso di Valtellina , made either from younger vine or from grape determined not to have the potential for long aging , wa intended to be more accessible than the two Valtellina Superiores . It wa also a year older than the others .
 Indeed , the Rosso wa simpler . Yet it wa beautifully balanced with all the delicious hallmark of nebbiolo : red fruit , menthol , aroma of herb and flower , a touch of tar . It also had a high-toned elegance , a zing of citrus zestiness and a light body that spoke more of a mountain wine than say the richer expression one might find from the Langhe , the home of Barolo and Barbaresco .
 The two Valtellina Superiores were intended to be more serious and age-worthy . These wine may come only from site judged to be the region ’ s best , which are generally situated in about five village : Grumello , Inferno , Maroggia , Sassella and Valgella .
 The Fay , from Valgella , wa discernibly richer and more tannic than the Rosso . It seemed riper and more powerful , with flavor of darker fruit , licorice , flower and mineral , yet still quite enjoyable at three year or so of age . I had a sense it wa both rustic and refined , with layered flavor that offered much more pleasure than a Barolo might have at a similarly young age .
 The Rainoldi , from Grumello , seemed more brooding . That is , the fruit wa dark-tinged and denser , with complex flavor of tobacco , licorice , menthol and flower . It , too , wa medium-bodied , and it grippy tannin gave it a sense of refined rusticity similar to that I found in the Fay .
 Each of these wine , I thought , offered a clear response to the reader Paul ’ s question : Why Valtellina ? They are different from Barolo and Barbaresco , just a other expression of nebbiolo from northern Italy , like Ghemme , Gattinara and Carema , are distinctive in their own way .
 “ These wine reside on a spectrum between Barbaresco and red Burgundy , ” wrote Kevin Day of Denver , who also happens to be a wine writer .
 It ’ s a tribute to the transparent beauty of the nebbiolo grape that it can express these sometimes subtle difference with such articulation . It also make you wonder what nebbiolo , which ha been notoriously difficult to grow outside northern Italy , could do elsewhere in the world . ( I ’ ll have more to say on that topic next week . )
 Most reader seemed to enjoy the wine very much . Martina Mirandola Mullen of New York called Valtellinas “ the most terroir-driven wine that I have ever had , ” while George Erdle of Charlotte , N.C. , said , “ We had no idea this grape could be shown with such vibrancy and finesse . ”
 I love reader ’ comment . Perhaps the most intriguing this month came from Aaron in Ottawa who said his tasting group drank Valtellina with “ 82-day dry-aged yak shank ” from Tiraislin Farm , cooked sou vide and served with “ dehydrated beurre blanc . ”
 The meal began with snail carpaccio served with toasted legume pâté and gooseberry compote . “ It wa a weeknight and so simple plating wa the theme , ” he said .
 For the record , Aaron report the Valtellina went better with the snail course than with the yak .
 Meanwhile , several reader , including Don Allen of Nashville wished I had included an example of Sforzato , a special type of Valtellina that is made by drying nebbiolo grape to concentrate them before fermentation , very much the way Amarone is made .
 It ’ s a good idea . Sforzato is a different sort of wine — bigger , darker and more alcoholic . Perhaps one day we will taste a few different wine made with dried grape . I guarantee Aaron of Ottawa that those wine will stand up to yak shank .

 The New Vanguard
 By Giovanni Russonello
 EAST LANSING , Mich. — The trumpeter Etienne Charles stood in a Michigan State University classroom on a recent Tuesday evening — about 2,000 mile north and 50 degree Fahrenheit south of his native Trinidad — and spoke to the undergrad big band that he directs here . The horn were having trouble nailing the inflection on “ Chega De Saudade , ” the bossa nova standard , so Mr. Charles sang the line out loud , vocalizing a kind of hand-drum pattern .
 Then he told the horn to play back their part , this time with the syncopation sharpened up . “ Right now we ’ re a little too far on the straight side , ” he said . Emphatic rhythm ha always been the engine oil of a jazz big band , but Mr. Charles ha original way of addressing that history , inherited from his own homeland tradition .
 His earliest instructor taught primarily by ear , and built from the rhythm up . “ Whatever song we were singing in the choir — whether it wa a Caribbean folk song , a chorale , a hymn — we would always learn the lyric first and then say the lyric in rhythm . And then after that they would teach u the note , ” he said over lunch at a restaurant near campus earlier that day . “ We were always rhythmically on , a a result . ”
 Mr. Charles , 35 , ha been uniting Trinidadian method with jazz idea since he moved to the United States in 2002 . He ’ s found that if you let them , they combine organically . Along the way , Mr. Charles ha developed a magnetic sound on trumpet — clear and mellifluous , with a deep sense of economy ; redolent of both Roy Hargrove and Chocolate Armenteros — and he ’ s becoming a composer to be reckoned with . Last year he became the newest member of the SFJAZZ Collective , contemporary jazz ’ s premier all-star band .
 On Friday he will release “ Carnival : The Sound of a People , Vol . 1 , ” his most invigorating record yet . It grew out of trip home during Trinidad ’ s spring Carnival — an annual festival of parade and performance , with deep but still-vital root in West African tradition . Its dance and song peer back across century , into the year of black indentured servitude , slavery and , ultimately , freedom on the other side of the Atlantic .
 In making “ Carnival , ” Mr. Charles brought a recording device along while he immersed himself in the festivity , then wrote a suite of original music . Unlike so much contemporary jazz that ’ s informed by global tradition , the album retains the atmosphere of restive jubilation that defines the actual event of Carnival . Mr. Charles ’ s band , featuring some of New York ’ s ace musician , sometimes play the piece alone . Elsewhere , it accompanies field recording of Carnival performer that Mr. Charles captured .
 For the drummer Obed Calvaire , who appears on “ Carnival ” and also play in the SFJAZZ Collective , this presented a fruitful challenge . “ What wa special for me wa to try to come up with a groove that fit inside their way of phrasing without interrupting , ” he said . He found himself marveling at “ some of the way those percussionist phrase . ”
 Mr. Charles ’ s recent album have all been studiously arranged and passionately played , but at time they feel dangerously tidy — a if his rigorous approach ha sanded off the tension and weight of the original tradition he ’ s addressing . On “ Carnival , ” he get past that . He ’ s drawn the rhythm from the source , and left off the varnish .
 “ People ask me how I think about the difference between jazz and Caribbean music , but jazz is Caribbean music , ” Mr. Charles said . “ When I started writing the music for ‘ Culture Shock , ’ I thought that there wa a difference , and that there wa actual integration or fusion going on , ” he said , referring to his debut record from 2006 . “ By the time I got to ‘ Creole Soul ’ ” — from 2013 — “ I had realized that the diaspora is just one . ”
 “ Carnival ” open with a gargle of voice , a honked car horn , the clattering of biscuit pan . You ’ re hearing the performance group 2001 Jab Molassie playing on the street in Trinidad ; they ’ re soon joined by a jazz septet playing an elastic and almost inebriated melody , folding it energy directly into the pan percussion . In footage captured for a future documentary film , you can see 2001 Jab Molassie ’ s member , some wearing devil ’ s horn , covered in blue paint and dancing fiercely in the street . They ’ re invoking the spirit of Jab Molassie , a mythical slave who wa burned to death in a vat of molasses , and whose revenge-seeking spirit is called upon by the pan drumming .
 On the next two track , “ Dame Lorraine ” and “ Moko Jumbie , ” the jazz group play alone , exhibiting a lyrical swagger and tight comportment on piece inspired by Carnival ’ s masquerading tradition . Throughout the album , Mr. Charles put a lot of power in the hand of his percussionist — whether it ’ s Mr. Calvaire on drum kit or the bamboo and iron percussionist that play on the five-track “ Black Echo ” suite . He subtly revisits the island ’ s historical development along the way : Black Trinidadians took up bamboo percussion for a time in the 19th century after the British banned iron instrument , which are believed to have sacred power .
 Mr. Charles wa born in Trinidad in 1983 , and his musical talent showed early . He entered into calypso competition at Carnival before he wa a teenager , making up song in the old tradition , usually built around social or political commentary . “ For calypso , you want to have something that ’ s socially apropos , ” he said . “ You learn not just how to sing a calypso , but how to study and analyze event . ”
 He added : “ What I didn ’ t know then wa , it wa teaching me how to write . ”
 He moved to Tallahassee in 2002 to study at Florida State University , where he wa mentored by the pianist Marcus Roberts . He hadn ’ t played much American jazz before enrolling , but he arrived bursting with talent and a professorial , inquisitive instinct . He wa a good fit for the music . Somewhere along the line he discovered a 2000 album by the Puerto Rican-born tenor saxophonist David Sánchez , “ Melaza , ” on which Mr. Sánchez unlooses homeland strategy and rhythm in a heady , contemporary-jazz context . “ That record changed my life , ” Mr. Charles said .
 He moved to New York in 2006 ( he still remembers the date : August 25 ) to attend Juilliard ’ s small , rigorous grad program , and after receiving his degree he spent about a year kicking around the city ’ s jazz scene . But he wa hired to teach at Michigan State soon after , and moved to a colder climate than he had ever thought he could tolerate .
 In the decade he ’ s spent on the faculty , he ha delved increasingly into research , partly thanks to the score and field recording available at Michigan State ’ s music library . In 2015 he wa awarded a Guggenheim fellowship , allowing him to take a few month off from teaching and return to Trinidad to research and write “ Carnival . ”
 That wa the most time he had spent back there since moving in 2002 , but throughout his career he ha maintained a connection to the island . He think of Trinidad le a a place from which to extract idea , and more a a homeland that he can , in turn , help enrich . A few year ago he noticed that live brass band , which had been a central component at Carnival , were on the wane , so he got one together and started leading it in the procession every year . ( When we spoke , he had only recently returned from this year ’ s celebration . )
 And on any trip home , Mr. Charles said , he try to teach workshop at school , prison and youth-correctional facility . Based on his experience there , he ’ s hoping to establish some way of helping incarcerated musician find job upon their release — perhaps by encouraging hotel to hire more live musician .
 “ Real , good music need to get to the people , ” he said . “ A lot of what ’ s funneled through the medium doesn ’ t teach people about their power or their freedom . It ’ s time for that to change . ”
 Articles in this series examine jazz musician who are helping reshape the art form , often beyond the glare of the spotlight .

 Those who claim New York to be the world ’ s dance capital have few ground better than the dance division of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts : the largest , most eclectic , and most enterprising collection of dance material anywhere . It regularly film dance production in the city , preserving the present for the future ; it aim to have a copy of every dance book ever published ; it posse treasure going back century . And it door are open to the public a well a to specialist researcher .
 For many dance devotee who live elsewhere , a visit to New York ha to include time on the third floor of that library , located at Lincoln Center , to view it dance film . Visiting from Britain in the 1970s and ’ 80 , I learned much about British dance that wa unknown back home . Find a screen , enter the online catalog , click a link , and within a minute or two you can find yourself watching Merce Cunningham and his company performing “ Antic Meet ” in 1964 .
 [ Read our review of a Jerome Robbins exhibition now on view at the New York Public Library . ]
 Curious how Balanchine ’ s “ Serenade ” looked when it wa danced in skirt ending at the knee ? Here are clip of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo ’ s 1940 and ’ 44 performance . Want to know how Margot Fonteyn looked in “ Sleeping Beauty ” when the Sadler ’ s Wells Ballet toured North America in the 1950s ? Here she is , in all three act .
 Today the dance division contains the collection of Mikhail Baryshnikov , Merce Cunningham and Jerome Robbins , among many more . Its full name is the Jerome Robbins Dance Division , and with good reason : The choreographer donated a share of all the royalty of his “ Fiddler on the Roof ” to it . This year , the dance division celebrates it 75th anniversary .
 I ’ ve been visiting it for 40 year ; revelation occur there frequently . I made many more discovery recently , when Linda Murray , the collection ’ s curator , gave me a tour of some of it rarer treasure , demonstrating it breadth and depth . Here we show just a few selection .
 Ballet shoe can be mere item of fan fetishism . The dance division , however , ha a number of dance shoe that are historically telling .
 Anna Pavlova ’ s foot were famously arched and tapered , yet her shoe have much le pronounced block for the toe than any modern ballerina would employ . She wa the most world-renowned ballerina with the most world-renowned foot — but her shoe make u marvel at the strength those slender foot must have had . ( This pair is thought to have been made in the 1920s , a decade when she traveled the globe . ) They also have a remarkable amount of side stitching . We can only speculate what support this gave her .
 The gold shoe worn by Serge Lifar for the premiere of George Balanchine ’ s “ Apollo ” ( 1928 ) accord with the intensely colorful costume originally given to the title character . ( Today ’ s Apollos wear white or black , with ordinary dance slipper . )
 Ballet ha it root in the Italian Renaissance , particularly in the work of the dancing master of the 15th and 16th century who established principle of harmony in dance term . The library ’ s copy of one of the earliest and most influential dance manual , “ De Pratica Seu Arte Tripudii ” ( “ On the Practice or Art of Dancing ” ) , is dated 1453 : The author is Guglielmo Ebreo ( William the Jew — “ Ebreo ” mean Hebrew ) from Pesaro ; his treatise is seminal , an indication of Renaissance thought governing dance to give it both rule and harmony .
 I ’ ve been reading secondhand about this sourcebook for year : I never expected to see an original copy , or to find that it wa handwritten . The language is at first impenetrable , but the word “ Danza ” ( dance ) , at the top of one page , is the beginning that lead the scholar into it teaching .
 In 1919 , at 30 , the already legendary dancer-choreographer Vaslav Nijinsky ( 1889-1950 ) wa found to have schizophrenia ; he remained in one institution or another for the rest of his life . During the early day of his illness he wrote a remarkable diary that became celebrated when his wife , Romola , published a bowdlerized version of it in English in 1936 . ( In 1999 , an unexpurgated version , edited by the critic Joan Acocella , wa published . ) The original is now in the library .
 Nijinsky ’ s mind wanders in many direction , but a recurring theme is God , with whom Nijinsky at time identifies . Nijinsky ’ s drawing show striking firmness of contour and force of color ; several suggest , a his wife said he intended , eye . In the context of his writing , it is easy to imagine them a the eye of God .
 The American dance critic Edwin Denby wrote in 1944 that modernism had reached it most radical extreme in the work of Nijinsky and his German contemporary , the dancer-choreographer Mary Wigman ( 1886-1973 ) . Martha Graham , only a few year younger , wa inspired in the 1920s by what she heard of Wigman . When Wigman finally toured the United States in 1930 , Graham burst into tear of relief when she found that her own work had not been a mere reproduction of Wigman ’ s after all .
 Wigman left a pictorial diary of her visit to America , seen here . In it page she seems jollier than her dance reputation suggests , but with a talent for mordant satire .
 From the first , the library ’ s dance collection included non-Western dance form . Though there are few film of Southeast Asian dance before the 1960s , here is a 1933 one of a Balinese dancer , bare-breasted , not performing a formal dance but demonstrating the exercise technique for the idiom . The film go on to record various ceremonial dance from Bali and Borneo .
 You can find film of Bedhaya , the Javanese court dance genre ; a 1966 festival of dance from 13 West African country in Senegal ; Cambodian dance performed at Angkor Wat ; boy training in Kathakali , the Indian classical form whose multilayered makeup alone take hour to apply ; and multiple example of whirling dervish and Egyptian belly dancing . As I type this in the library , I ’ m watching a 40-minute color documentary about Mongolian dance , filmed in the open air with mountain on every horizon . One man ’ s rhythmic isolation of alternate shoulder are fabulously huge — and cause his colleague to grin from ear to ear .
 George Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein opened the School of American Ballet in 1934 , and soon afterward a professional company , the American Ballet ( a precursor of New York City Ballet ) . Kirstein worked to devise ballet that would be American and labored for many month with Balanchine on an adaptation of Harriet Beecher Stowe ’ s novel “ Uncle Tom ’ s Cabin. ” Here is “ Tom , ” the pictorial libretto he commissioned from the American poet-dramatist E.E . Cummings , with illustration by Ben Shahn .
 The score wa to have been by Virgil Thomson , the composer of the avant-garde opera “ Four Saints in Three Acts ” ( 1934 , performed by an African-American cast ) . Kirstein ’ s handwritten diary — also kept by the dance division and often consulted by scholar — record many discussion and plan for “ Tom ” with Balanchine , Cummings and Thomson , though separately . Nonetheless no “ Tom ” ballet ever materialized ; it remains one of history ’ s intriguing might-have-been .

 The new development ha high-end retail , art you can play with and not enough bathroom .
 By Jon Caramanica
 One recent afternoon , I took a cab down to Hudson Yards from the Upper West Side . With little prompting , the driver lamented how the development had taken away two thing he ’ d held sacred : the relative calm of the neighborhood before development started and the view eastward of the Midtown skyline , now obscured .
 After a rueful few second , he mumbled , “ I feel choked . ”
 Certainly , there is a falsity to the Hudson Yards complex , which sits atop an active train yard and shoot up to the sky impressively but generally thoughtlessly . But to be fair , the whole of 11th Avenue is a zoo of gauche intrusion , from the residential development in the 60 to the car dealership in the 50 all the way down to the renovated industrial building in the 20 . There ’ s never been a true neighborhood along it . Why start now ?
 Agita of that sort is why , so often in recent week , you ’ ve heard that Hudson Yards is New York City ’ s Dubai .
 That ’ s a grave insult to Dubai , where there are indoor surfing wave and artificial island shaped like all the country of the globe .
 More accurately , Hudson Yards is Midtown ’ s Battery Park City , both le insidious and more mundane than how it ha been advertised . Up top , it ’ s gleaming , but at ground level , it ’ s deeply unromantic .
 When you come up the escalator from the 7 train station , what you see first aren ’ t artisanal food truck , but regular coffee and hot dog cart . From the front , the building that house the Shops & Restaurants at Hudson Yards is shiny but unremarkable ; look up and you ’ re greeted by the posterior of Lululemon mannequin .
 The Hudson Yards shopping complex is two mall in one , really . The first is at the top and bottom : The fifth floor ( and above ) ha the first New York outpost of two Dallas multibrand retail force — Neiman Marcus , the 110-plus-year and 40-plus-store luxury specialist , and Forty Five Ten , a forward-looking emporium just beginning to develop a national presence . The ground level feature stand-alone storefront for Fendi , Coach , Tory Burch , Dunhill and others , a well a Rolex , Cartier and Piaget .
 And then there ’ s everything in between , largely of spick-and-span version of chain store available at dozen of other place in the city .
 The result ha the feel of one of New York ’ s 80/20 building , where a certain percentage of apartment in new construction are given over to affordable housing a a make-good for a whole heap of market-rate chicanery . I would not be surprised to learn that there is a secret elevator that go straight from a private car entrance to the fifth floor .
 Up on 5 , the diversity of rich people on three recent visit wa staggering : people with $ 300 sneaker , and also with $ 1,200 sneaker ; art-gallery-owner chic , and Upper East Side matriarch chic ; people who D.J . for bottle service club , and people who buy bottle service ; young people with designer fanny pack who looked like Jerrika Karlae , or Jimin , or Davido , or Anuel AA and Karol G .
 By contrast , on the third floor , a smiling kid wearing a hoodie from Anuel AA and Karol G ’ s tour wa going up and down the escalator , having a great time .
 NEIMAN MARCUS AND FORTY FIVE TEN together make for a worthy addition to the city ’ s retail landscape . Forty Five Ten is broken into four distinct storefront , making the fifth floor feel like a theme park . There is a well-stocked woman ’ s designer section , a cluster of emerging designer , some vintage and a men ’ s section .
 The Forty Five Ten in Dallas is so effective because it ha the most forward-looking brand mix in the city . Here , though , in the men ’ s department , the thick scrum of Rick Owens , Thom Browne and Stone Island feel predictable , a selection salvaged by a handful of stunning piece : an oversize yellow print parka with aviator hood from Takahiromiyashita the Soloist ( $ 2,500 ) and a ruggedly cut military-style jacket with detachable liner by Jil Sander ( $ 2,750 ) .
 The woman ’ s store is far more effective , with wilder style from a wider range of company : a short-sleeved cropped floral sweater from Molly Goddard ( $ 350 ) just a couple of foot from a stunning princess cape covered in glittery embroidery by Rodarte ( $ 10,388 ) ; a Monse patchwork wrap skirt and short set made of what looked like rep-tie-patterned silk ( $ 1,890 ) and also a sharp black top with architectural pouf sleeve from Dice Kayek ( $ 1,195 ) .
 The emerging designer space had le ornate form of cleverness : diffusion prairie dress from Batsheva , stern folk-art slide from Nicole Saldana , nü-basics from Sandy Liang and Eckhaus Latta . And in the vintage shop , there are framed copy of Avant Garde magazine , from the company president ’ s personal collection . ( Not for sale , sadly . )
 On a recent Saturday , Neiman Marcus , which begin on the fifth floor and rise two more , felt like a true amusement park . In the men ’ s section , there wa a foosball table , an arcade game and a Skee-Ball game all getting load of use . But at any given time , only a handful of clerk were working , eyeing the huge floor like a center fielder at Fenway .
 The selection wa wide but not particularly deep . Some fine-enough Balenciaga and a Burberry collection that could plausibly pas for bootleg . There were generous helping of Kiton and Brunello Cucinelli .
 But the real showcase wa the shoe section . Now me , I ’ m old enough to remember when you had to hunt for $ 1,000 sneaker , but here they all are , indifferent to who might buy them . The only refreshing disruption wa a thorough selection of Lucchese boot , the biggest in the city . I tried on a $ 3,000 pair of alligator boot , and immediately my posture improved . They made me feel beautiful ( and also poor ) .
 Even though this Neiman Marcus is vast , it ’ s le a space for serious clothes shopping and more for superluxe trinket , which is why the whole of the fifth floor is given over to bag , shoe , scarf and other low-hanging fruit of wealth signification , whether it ’ s a saddle bag from the Row ( $ 1,980 ) only a few will be able to identify or a graffitied kitten heel from Balenciaga that will lose half it value the moment it leaf the store .
 A woman walked up to the display of exquisitely brittle-looking René Caovilla sandal and whispered to her partner , “ Cinderella shoesssss. ” You will never miss Phoebe Philo more than when looking at the spiceless wall of Celine handbag here .
 ONCE YOU GO BELOW THE FIFTH FLOOR , however , thing change radically . Given the size of this building , there is surprisingly little shopping to be done . I ’ ve never been somewhere where the ratio of people walking through the hall to those actually in a store wa a high a it wa on the middle floor here . Those space feel more like tourist attraction , especially given the large-scale art installation scattered throughout .
 Much of the art is interactive , meant for lingering : a wall of scrapable sequin by Lara Schnitger , which never didn ’ t have a few dozen teenager fiddling with it ; pastel industrial-collapse animal statue bench from Serban Ionescu , which provided succor for glum-looking shopper ; a psychedelic mural with embedded QR code from Jeanette Hayes . ( Whoever selected the artist follows the same people on Instagram that I do . Please contact me for your future curatorial need . )
 Even though there are plenty of attraction and distraction , the act of actually accommodating people still feel like a challenge . The mall is curiously under-bathroomed , and trash and recycling bin aren ’ t prominent . The music can be comically loud , like the hi-NRG goth-SoulCycle assault that defied Shazaming .
 That tension , between being a place for people to shop and a place for people to merely linger and marvel , is the clearest on the ground floor . Cartier , Piaget , Rolex — inside , they ’ re beatific , and there are guard at the door to ensure they remain that way . Out in the corridor , greeter in black suit and blue tie enthusiastically guide lost tourist to the escalator , perhaps hoping they ’ ll be sated by some H & M or Athleta , or some ice cream from Van Leeuwen ( which always had a line ) .
 The grimmest space in the whole building is the art store near the exit , Avant Gallery , which sell overpriced , absurd post-graffiti canvas that would be gauche even in the middle of a third-tier suburban mall .
 For a development whose idea of an art installation is the staircase-to-nowhere Vessel , a conceptually rigorous a the sprinkle pit at the ice cream museum , this perhaps isn ’ t much of a surprise .
 But a a barometer of the level of sophistication the owner expect of their customer , it ’ s telling . They ’ re counting on the fact that money doesn ’ t know where it came from , and it doesn ’ t care where it go — all the way to the sky , or buried deep in the ground .

( Simon & Schuster , $ 28 . ) Lizzie Borden , accused of killing her father and stepmother with an ax in 1892 , ha gone down in history a villain , victim , punch line and the medium sensation of the Gilded Age . This new book about the case wa nearly 20 year in the making , and it is “ enthralling , ” our critic Parul Sehgal writes . “ Robertson doe not work for the prosecution or the defense .

 GINGERBREAD , by Helen Oyeyemi .

 WASHINGTON — President Trump hosted Jair Bolsonaro , the Brazilian president , at the White House on Tuesday , and it wa something like looking in the mirror .
 Like other authoritarian leader Mr. Trump ha embraced since taking office , Mr. Bolsonaro is an echo of the American president : a brash nationalist whose populist appeal come partly from his use of Twitter and his history of making crude statement about woman , gay people and indigenous group .
 “ They say he ’ s the Donald Trump of South America , ” Mr. Trump marveled during a speech to the Farm Bureau in January , noting that Mr. Bolsonaro had been called the “ Trump of the tropic ” since taking office this year . “ Do you believe that ? And he ’ s happy with that . If he wasn ’ t , I wouldn ’ t like the country so much . But I like him . ”
 At a news conference after the two men held a luncheon meeting , Mr. Trump gushed that “ I think Brazil ’ s relationship with the United States , because of our friendship , is probably better than it ’ s ever been by far . ”
 “ Our trade with Brazil will go substantially up , ” Mr. Trump predicted earlier in the afternoon , “ and that ’ s one of the thing Brazil would like to see . ”
 United States official said this week that Mr. Trump appreciated the way Mr. Bolsonaro powered his way to victory in Brazil ’ s election by being unabashedly pro-American and declaring repeatedly that he wanted to have a close relationship with Mr. Trump .
 In part because of the stylistic similarity between the two leader , White House official expressed optimism that Brazil and the United States — two of the largest economy in the Western Hemisphere — would be able to work through disagreement and forge a closer bond on trade and regional issue in South America , including confronting the political crisis in Venezuela .
 But the warmth displayed between the two leader at the White House also underscore how Mr. Trump ha upended the usual foreign policy tradition established over decade by his predecessor .
 Since taking office , Mr. Trump ha repeatedly confronted and challenged the United States ’ closest democratic ally , including the leader of Canada , Germany and France , while speaking with glowing admiration about some of the globe ’ s most brutal dictator : Kim Jong-un of North Korea , Vladimir V. Putin of Russia , Xi Jinping of China , Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt , Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines .

 My colleague , Ernesto Londoño , on the story of Bolsonaro . It ’ s Wednesday , March 20 . So who is Bolsonaro , and how did he enter Brazilian politics ?
 ernesto londoño
 Bolsonaro is a former army captain . He wa a paratrooper who had a pretty short and fairly turbulent stint in the military . He actually got kicked out . But after leaving the military in not the best of term , he wa very successful at sliding into a political career , initially a a city council member in his native Rio de Janeiro . And then very soon , he found his way to the capital , Brasília , a a congressman .

 The dictatorship wa at it most harsh in the late ‘ 60 and early ‘ 70 .

 And the country wa emerging from a pretty traumatic period .

 Student demonstration in 1968 , calling for the restoration of democratic right , prompted a strong response from the military .

 It wa definitely an era of repression , of terror , for many group that were at odds with the military government , and a pretty widespread censorship and curtailment of civil right .

 But in ‘ 88 , lawmaker passed a very progressive Constitution .

 If there is one point where it became starkly clear that Brazil had reached cruising altitude a a democracy , it would ’ ve been the election of Luiz Inácio da Silva , commonly known a Lula , in 2002 . Lula wa a former shoeshiner , son of a single mother , raised poor , rose to prominence a a union leader , started building a political movement during the era of military rule and wa briefly jailed a a political prisoner .

 michael barbaro
 And what role doe Bolsonaro play in the midst of this pretty dramatic shift in Brazil ?
 ernesto londoño
 Bolsonaro wa seen a kind of a loud and obnoxious lawmaker , who would just get into these shouting match in Congress , would deliver these fiery speech .

 And the most startling thing , and it wa the theme he went back and back to , wa his praise for the era of military rule .

 ( SPEAKING PORTUGUESE )
 ernesto londoño
 That Brazil needed strong men at the helm and that this experiment with democracy wa not taking the country in the right direction .
 michael barbaro
 So just a kind of modern democratic Brazil is coming into form , it sound like Bolsonaro is entering politics , but is pushing in the other direction , for le democracy , more authoritarianism .
 ernesto londoño
 Absolutely . He essentially made the case , only the military can run this large , unwieldy country effectively . And we ’ re wasting our time thinking that this experiment with democracy is going to take u anywhere productive .
 michael barbaro
 And what wa the response to moment like that ?
 ernesto londoño
 Largely speaking , people started saying , well , that ’ s just Bolsonaro being Bolsonaro . He made headline . He wa admonished . He wa criticized . But he wa not somebody who wa really taken seriously . He wa not somebody who wa center stage when big deal were being negotiated . For most of his career , he wa a little bit of a sideshow . And at the same time —

 In Brazil , Petrobras recently made what could be the world ’ s biggest oil discovery since the 1970s .
 ernesto londoño
 Lula had a remarkably successful first term a president , and Brazilians started seeing some pretty sweeping change . Brazil , like much of the region , wa enjoying a commodity boom .

 The discovery could mean that Brazil will become one of the world ’ s leading oil exporter .

 There were some pretty groundbreaking policy that paved the way for people from poor family , people from rural community , for the first time to go to university .

 In just seven year , almost 30 million Brazilians have joined the rank of the middle class , some helped by government handout , others through improved education , which lead to higher wage .

 There wa a sense that inequality wa diminishing in a country where it ’ s long been really hard to move up the ladder . And Brazil started aspiring to great thing . Brazil started making alliance with other large economy , like Russia and China and South Africa , and kind of projecting itself on the world stage a a rising power . I think this all became crystal clear , just kind of a sense of optimism and the sense that Brazil seemed unstoppable , when —

 I have the honor to announce that the Games of the 31st Olympiad are awarded to the city of Rio de Janeiro . [ CROWD CHEERS ]
 ernesto londoño
 In 2009 , Brazil beat the odds and won the right to host the 2016 Olympic Games . And , you know , looking back now at how optimistic , you know , the scene of people partying on the beach in Copacabana , just celebrating this major triumph for Brazil , it seems impossible to think now that the seed of what would happen next had already been planted . And the reality wa that underneath this triumphant country that seemed to be rising into a bright new era , underneath all that , there wa a lot of rot . And it would take a few year for people here to discover just how much .
 [ music ]

 michael barbaro
 So , Ernesto , how did this rot that you describe , this ugliness beneath the surface , eventually get exposed ?
 ernesto londoño
 Well , thing in Brazil started taking a definite turn for the worse in 2014 . Two major thing happened . On the one hand , the economy , which had been on a slide , entered into recession . On the other hand , a team of investigator stumbled into a major scandal while they were looking at some funny financial transaction , initially at a gas station .

 In the past week , Brazilians have had wall-to-wall coverage of a political scandal threatening to bring down the country ’ s government . It first came to light when Brazilian police uncovered a money laundering operation at a car wash .

 It ’ s known a Operation Car Wash .
 ernesto londoño
 That quickly reached very , very deeply into very powerful politician and the top company in Brazil .

 The investigation center on a billion-dollar corruption scandal at Brazil ’ s mammoth oil corporation , Petrobras .

 Petrobras is one of Brazil ’ s biggest company . It ’ s alleged senior official took almost $ 700 million in bribe when awarding construction contract . Many that may have taken bribe are linked to the government .

 We ’ re talking about massive company that had entire department with the task of paying bribe to politician .

 The speaker of Brazil ’ s lower house of Congress ha been charged over alleged involvement in a corruption scandal at the state-run —

 News breaking in the last hour that the former president of Brazil is being detained by police after a raid on his home and office —
 ernesto londoño
 It soon became apparent to Brazilians that corruption had been institutionalized .
 archived recording
 Five former Brazilian president , nearly one out of three cabinet minister , and almost one out of three senator have been indicted or investigated .
 michael barbaro
 And what wa the reaction in the general Brazilian public once all this corruption come to light ?
 ernesto londoño
 There wa outrage .

 As these scandal started engulfing some of the pillar of the economy here , some of the biggest company in the country , unemployment go up , people ’ s purchasing power go down , and state government start going bankrupt .

 [ CHANTING ]
 ernesto londoño
 In some place , this mean the police aren ’ t getting paid . And people start seeing a surge of violence .
 archived recording
 With more than 50,000 violent death every year , Brazil ha one of the world ’ s highest homicide rate .
 ernesto londoño
 They go from a period of feeling optimistic and almost euphoric about the future to a period of despair and anguish .
 michael barbaro
 And where is Bolsonaro in all of this ?
 ernesto londoño
 Bolsonaro is one of the rarer veteran lawmaker who ha not really been splattered by these corruption investigation . And at this time , he start getting a fair amount of traction . All of a sudden , this guy who had kind of been a fringe character come more into sync with how Brazilians were feeling about their lot in life .
 archived recording ( jair bolsonaro )
 ( SPEAKING PORTUGUESE )
 ernesto londoño
 Around 2016 , he start telling people that he want to take a shot at the presidency .
 archived recording ( jair bolsonaro )
 ( SPEAKING PORTUGUESE )
 ernesto londoño
 And the way he spread his message wa unique in the history of Brazilian presidential race . He wa campaigning largely by sitting in front of a phone , which wa often shaky .

 And just broadcasting video live on Facebook , on Instagram .

 Where he wa speaking to people a though they were long-lost friend .
 archived recording ( jair bolsonaro )
 ( SPEAKING PORTUGUESE )
 ernesto londoño
 It wa completely unscripted , oftentimes stream-of-consciousness . He would jump from one subject to another .
 archived recording ( jair bolsonaro )
 ( SPEAKING PORTUGUESE )
 ernesto londoño
 And I think people saw that a pretty refreshing . People were so disgusted with politics a usual in the political establishment that they saw in this guy , who had been in the fringe for so long , somebody who could radically reinvent the system .
 archived recording
 [ CHANTING ]
 michael barbaro
 And doe he have the stature at this moment to do that ?
 ernesto londoño
 When the very first rumbling of a Bolsonaro presidential bid start coming up , people laughed it off . The conventional wisdom wa he ’ s too extreme . He ’ s too outside of the norm . But despite the skepticism , by the end of 2017 , it became pretty clear that Bolsonaro ’ s message had strong appeal across the country .
 archived recording
 [ CHANTING ]
 michael barbaro
 And what exactly is he promising on the campaign trail that the Brazilian people are finding so compelling ?
 ernesto londoño
 On corruption , he wa very clear in stating that he wa going have no patience for business a usual . And that under his tenure —
 archived recording ( jair bolsonaro )
 ( SPEAKING PORTUGUESE )
 ernesto londoño
 People who were corrupt had ton to fear . But I think the main promise he made to his supporter wa that he wa going to take extraordinary measure to restore security . And we ’ re talking about pretty draconian thing . Bolsonaro , for example , once said , “ A good criminal is a dead criminal . ”
 archived recording ( jair bolsonaro )
 ( SPEAKING PORTUGUESE )
 ernesto londoño
 He made it clear he wa essentially going to give the police free rein to shoot suspected criminal on the spot .
 archived recording ( jair bolsonaro )
 ( SPEAKING PORTUGUESE )
 ernesto londoño
 The third thing he did , which wa unusual , wa surround himself with military leader and make them kind of a core base of support . The military had been largely out of sight in politics in Brazil for the past three decade . So this wa a pretty bold move , but actually one that captured people ’ s imagination a they longed for a system that wa more orderly and more secure .
 michael barbaro
 So this cranky , often outrageous character is starting to connect with people .
 ernesto londoño
 Absolutely .
 archived recording
 [ CHANTING ]
 ernesto londoño
 However , I think it ’ s important to note that there were a couple of pretty crucial turning point that turbocharged his presidential bid .
 archived recording
 Brazil ’ s former president , Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , is to stand trial for allegedly accepting over $ 1 million in bribe .
 ernesto londoño
 Early last year , former president Lula , who had been the front-runner according to opinion poll , and who wa trying to make a bid for a third term in the presidential palace , got jailed . And after he get jailed on corruption and money laundering charge , he essentially becomes disqualified , and his party is in disarray . And then you fast forward a few month , and in September of last year , there ’ s a very dramatic moment when , on the campaign trail , Bolsonaro is marching through the street of a small town , surrounded by supporter . And a man lunge toward him with a big kitchen knife and stab him in the stomach .
 archived recording
 [ SIRENS ] Jair Bolsonaro ha been left in a serious but stable condition in hospital , this after being stabbed while drumming up support ahead of next month ’ s vote . Hospital official say it could take two month for him to recover .
 ernesto londoño
 He wa essentially knocked off the campaign trail for the remainder of the race . He wa in a hospital bed , and then he wa in his apartment , and communicating virtually only through social medium .
 archived recording ( jair bolsonaro )
 ( SPEAKING PORTUGUESE )
 ernesto londoño
 People , I think , saw in this moment the kind of violence that he wa railing against in a really crystallized form . This incident that could have easily ended his life ended up propelling his bid .
 archived recording
 [ CHANTING ] The breaking news is the far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro ha won Brazil ’ s presidential race .
 ernesto londoño
 And after this happens , in October , he ha a decisive victory .
 michael barbaro
 And what is the reaction across Brazil to this victory ?
 ernesto londoño
 Brazil emerges from the election pretty polarized . Somebody who had been a very , very long shot for the presidency wa able to not just win , but win decisively . However , you also have many community in the country that feel extraordinarily unsafe in this new Brazil and that worry that the country under Bolsonaro ’ s watch could well transition into a new era of authoritarian rule .
 michael barbaro
 I wonder what Bolsonaro ’ s election mean for Brazil , which , a you told u earlier , is just 30 year from having been a military dictatorship and turned to democracy and seems to have had a pretty rocky journey .
 ernesto londoño
 I think it illustrates that many people , not just in Brazil but across Latin America , have become very cynical about democracy , at least the version of democracy they were seeing . Many Brazilians felt that they were being governed by thief , who just kept getting elected by playing the old political playbook . And I think , in the specific case of Bolsonaro , who come with a history of having championed authoritarian rule , of wanting to govern very closely with senior military leader , the promise of order , even if it came at the price of a rollback of civil liberty and of democracy , it wa a price many Brazilians were perfectly willing to pay .
 michael barbaro
 So to change this system that seems to not be working , it feel like Brazilians want to shock the system and perhaps test it limit , which sound a little bit like what ’ s going on in the United States .
 ernesto londoño
 Absolutely . When I talked to people on the campaign trail , you know , I wa really startled by the level of anguish that they expressed and their willingness to take big risk on a leader who wa untested and who come with all these question mark .
 michael barbaro
 Ernesto , thank you very much .
 ernesto londoño
 Thank you .

 Just week after his swearing in , when Bolsonaro vowed to , quote , “ rid Brazil of corruption , ” he faced charge that his own administration wa engaging in more of the same . Brazilian prosecutor are investigating the mysterious movement of more than $ 300,000 in and out of bank account controlled by the driver of Bolsonaro ’ s oldest son , a state lawmaker , and why some of those payment went to Bolsonaro ’ s wife . At the same time , Bolsonaro ha appointed three government minister who were previously implicated in investigation of corruption .
 Mr. Bolsonaro ha long been an apologist for the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for more than two decade , but he wa elected by an ample margin and Brazil is now very much a democracy .
 A former army captain who served for decade in the Brazilian congress , Mr. Bolsonaro vaulted onto the international scene by winning his country ’ s election last year . He made his first international appearance a president when he attended the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , in January .
 At the White House on Tuesday , Mr. Bolsonaro pledged that the United States and Brazil would “ stand side by side in their effort to ensure liberty and respect to traditional family lifestyle , respect to God our creator against the gender ideology or the politically correct attitude , and against fake news . ”
 A few minute later , Mr. Trump said he wa “ very proud to hear the president use the term ‘ fake news . ’ ”
 In an interview on Fox News on Monday night , Mr. Bolsonaro lashed out at the news medium — much the way Mr. Trump often doe — for what he said were inaccurate representation of his past statement about race and woman , including having said at one point that “ yes , I am homophobic — and very proud of it . ”
 “ If it were all that , I would not at all have been elected president , ” Mr. Bolsonaro told Shannon Bream of Fox . “ So there ’ s a great deal of fake news certainly around — the Brazilian population ha after all learned how to use social medium . And they no longer trust or believe the Brazilian mainstream medium , which is virtually dominated by the left wing . ”
 Mr. Bolsonaro insisted that “ I have nothing against homosexual or woman — I ’ m not a xenophobe . ”
 With Mr. Bolsonaro by his side at the White House , Mr. Trump lashed out at social medium company like Twitter and Facebook , accusing them of being “ collusive ” with his critic and discriminating against conservative and Republicans . Reacting to a lawsuit filed against social medium company by Representative Devin Nunes , a California Republican and one of his supporter , Mr. Trump hinted that he wa prepared to take action against what he called “ unfair ” practice by the company .
 “ Well , we have to do something , I tell you , ” Mr. Trump said .
 “ If they ’ re in a certain group , there ’ s discrimination and big discrimination , ” he said . “ I see it absolutely on Twitter and Facebook. ” Mr. Trump also criticized television network . “ The incredible thing is that we can win an election and we have such a stacked deck , and that includes network . ”
 Mr. Trump and Mr. Bolsonaro said they discussed the future of Venezuela , and Mr. Trump praised his counterpart for Brazil ’ s humanitarian aid to Venezuela and support for Juan Guaidó , the self-declared interim president .
 Responding to a question about why sanction by the United States have so far failed to force Nicolás Maduro , the Venezuela ’ s socialist leader , to surrender his grip on the presidency , Mr. Trump said that the United States had still not imposed the toughest sanction possible .
 “ We really haven ’ t done the really tough sanction yet , ” Mr. Trump said . “ We can do the tough sanction , and all option are open . We can go a lot tougher if we need to do that . ”
 Earlier in the day , the Treasury Department imposed a new round of sanction against Minerven , Venezuela ’ s state-owned gold-mining company and it president , Adrian Antonio Perdomo Mata , a part of it effort to increase pressure to the Maduro government . It accused Minerven of propping up Mr. Maduro through “ illicit gold operation , ” including paying independent miner for gold with “ nearly worthless bolívars ” to sustain the military .
 “ The illegitimate Maduro regime is pillaging the wealth of Venezuela while imperiling indigenous people by encroaching on protected area and causing deforestation and habitat loss , ” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said .
 Appearing with Mr. Bolsonaro in the Oval Office before their meeting , Mr. Trump said that he knew “ exactly ” what he wanted to happen in Venezuela , but he declined to say what that wa . He said that all option were on the table , including the use of the military .
 Asked about the possibility of joining the United States in a potential military action against Venezuela , Mr. Bolsonaro declined to answer , saying that “ these reserved issue , which may be discussed , if they have not yet , will not become public . ”
 Mr. Bolsonaro ’ s visit to Washington received mixed review at home , where many Brazilians were outraged to hear him praise the Trump administration ’ s plan to build a wall along the Mexican border and say a majority of immigrant who head to the United States do not have “ good intention . ”
 The satire website Sensacionalista mocked Mr. Bolsonaro for concession announced during the trip : waiving the visa requirement for United States citizen visiting Brazil and agreeing to allow company from the United States to launch commercial satellite from a base near the Equator .
 “ In exchange for the use of our base and the visa exemption for Americans , the president will come home with a Trump baseball cap , ” the article said .
 “ It ’ s actually an incredible location when you study it , and when you see it , ” Mr. Trump said on Tuesday , referring to the agreement Mr. Bolsonaro had announced allowing United States company to launch satellite from a base in Alcantara , along the north coast of Brazil . “ We won ’ t go into it now , but because of the location , tremendous amount of money would be saved . To put it very simply , the flight are a lot shorter . ”
 Brazil expert in the United States said the visit had gone well and would most likely establish a foundation for closer cooperation between the two largest economy in the Americas .
 “ We can point to the removal of visa restriction by Brazil on U.S. citizen a a signal that Brazil is working to reduce barrier to engagement , ” said Roberta Braga , an associate director at the Atlantic Council ’ s Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center .

 Fiat Chrysler ’ s boldest and most recent bid to bring diesel technology to American consumer ha wound up costing the automaker plenty .
 On Thursday the company agreed to pay hundred of million of dollar to settle lawsuit accusing it of it rigging certain diesel-powered pickup truck and Jeeps with illegal software to pas emission test .
 Including fine , the cost of recall , remedial effort , extended warranty and other provision , the settlement could cost close to $ 800 million .
 While diesel remains a popular choice for heavy-duty pickup and larger truck , Fiat Chrysler ’ s setback is the latest example of the industry ’ s failed attempt to develop diesel engine for smaller vehicle that are both highly fuel-efficient and clean , said Mike Ramsey , an automotive analyst at Gartner .
 “ It ’ s pretty much been a disaster , ” Mr. Ramsey said . “ This is evidence that they couldn ’ t actually make it work , but continued to sell them and market them for year . ”
 Fifteen year ago , Mercedes-Benz , BMW and Volkswagen joined force to develop “ clean ” diesel , a part of their effort to meet stringent new regulation on tailpipe emission being put into place in Europe and the United States . By 2011 Volkswagen had built a growing following for it diesel Jetta , Beetle and other model , and other automaker raced to offer their own clean diesel model .
 Fiat Chrysler introduced diesel version of it Ram 1500 pickup and Jeep Grand Cherokee in 2014 .
 For a time , environmental scientist marveled at the vehicle , which offered power and efficiency for moderate price while seeming to emit far le pollution than older diesel engine . But research at West Virginia University eventually showed that while Volkswagen ’ s diesel passed emission test , they released far more pollutant than allowed in real-world driving .
 In 2015 , Volkswagen acknowledged that it diesel car were equipped with software that activated robust emission control in testing but disabled them at other time , a revelation whose legal and reputational cost continue to reverberate . After that , the United States Environmental Protection Agency began looking more closely at other company that made diesel vehicle , and Fiat Chrysler wa one of them .
 In 2017 , the Justice Department sued the company over the E.P.A. ’ s finding that Fiat Chrysler had used illegal engine-control software that turned off pollution control under certain driving condition . The E.P.A . contended that the software enabled the vehicle to pas emission test while allowing them to release higher level of pollutant in normal driving , conduct the agency called “ serious and egregious . ”
 Under the settlement announced Thursday , the company will pay $ 305 million in civil penalty in connection with those claim and another $ 6 million over allegation of illegally importing noncompliant vehicle .
 It will also pay $ 19 million to mitigate excess emission from noncompliant vehicle in California , which also sued the company .
 “ Fiat Chrysler ’ s effort to defeat emission control is a clear violation of the law , and they also tried to hide their action , ” the E.P.A. ’ s acting administrator , Andrew Wheeler , said in a conference call . “ The E.P.A . caught them cheating . ”
 As part of the agreement , Fiat Chrysler will recall about 100,000 diesel-powered Ram 1500 truck and Jeep Grand Cherokee sport-utility vehicle from the 2014 , 2015 and 2016 model year . The recall repair involves installing new software in the vehicle and providing extended warranty , at a total cost of up to $ 185 million , the Justice Department said .
 Fiat Chrysler said vehicle owner could expect the recall later this year .
 In addition , owner will be eligible for compensation of $ 990 to $ 3,075 from Fiat Chrysler and Bosch , a German company that supplied engine computer and software . That agreement that could cost up to $ 300 million . Fiat Chrysler said it would bear an estimated $ 280 million of that cost .
 The Justice Department said the settlement did not resolve any potential criminal liability .
 “ A multinational bad actor ha seriously violated American emission law , to the detriment of the health and welfare of the American people , ” said Jeffrey Clark , assistant attorney general in the department ’ s Environment and Natural Resources Division .
 Fiat Chrysler , however , ha said that it software did not amount to an illegal defeat device . “ Our position on that hasn ’ t changed , ” said Eric Mayne , a company spokesman .
 The settlement amount wa in line with the $ 800 million that the company set aside in October to cover it , and it stock closed up 1.5 percent on Thursday .
 Analysts said the company wa unlikely to suffer any significant damage to it reputation with American consumer , or any long-lasting decline in sale . “ If sale do drop , I think they ’ ll pop back up pretty quickly , ” said Michelle Krebs , an executive analyst at Autotrader .
 Fiat Chrysler is coming off a strong year in North America . Although the company ’ s profit fell on a global basis in the first nine month of 2018 , it North American division ’ s pretax profit rose 17 percent .
 The company is benefiting from a decision in 2015 to focus on truck and S.U.V.s , which have higher profit margin than smaller vehicle . In the United States , Fiat Chrysler ’ s new-vehicle sale rose 9 percent in 2018 , while the overall market grew just 1 percent . Fiat Chrysler stopped making sedan in the United States five year ago and ha added more high-margin variant of it truck and Jeeps , a move Ford Motor is making only now .
 The company still face challenge , however . It ha not pushed into electric vehicle and self-driving technology a aggressively a Ford , General Motors and some other company have , though it Pacifica minivan is being used in Waymo ’ s autonomous-vehicle testing .
 In addition , it chief executive , Mike Manley , ha been on the job for just six month . He succeeded Sergio Marchionne , who died in July at 66 after shoulder surgery .
 United States official viewed the Fiat Chrysler matter a le serious in some respect than the Volkswagen case because it involved fewer vehicle and the truck and S.U.V.s had been on the road for le time . The E.P.A . also stopped short of accusing the company of intentionally engineering the software to cheat on emission test .
 Volkswagen pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and other charge brought by the Justice Department . The company agreed to pay $ 22 billion in settlement and fine , including $ 4.3 billion to settle a case brought by federal prosecutor . It also wa required to buy back 600,000 diesel vehicle from American consumer . Two Volkswagen executive pleaded guilty to criminal charge in the United States .
 An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the status of Fiat Chrysler ’ s production of diesel-powered vehicle for consumer . After a halt in the 2017 model year for regulatory reason , the company resumed making diesel version of the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Ram 1500 pickup ; it diesel era ha not ended . The error wa repeated in a headline .

 Meet Romostradamus . Savor Romomania . And behold the beauty of real expertise in a country starved of it .
 By Frank Bruni
 Opinion Columnist
 The Super Bowl arrives and , with it , so many question big and small . Is Tom Brady part cyborg and maybe even immortal ? Will the Los Angeles Rams be hamstrung by the knowledge that they got this far by the grace of several sleepwalking referee ?
 How frequently will Tony Romo see the future ? And might our fascination with that speak to a longing that reach far beyond football ?
 But first a quick primer on Romo , CBS ’ s dependably psychic commentator . Over the course of two season analyzing National Football League game from the broadcast booth , he ha provided more than the usual blather and banter . He guess what will happen next : blitz or no blitz , run or pas , involving this wide receiver or that tight end . He doesn ’ t do this for every play , but he doe it repeatedly . And if he were picking stock on Wall Street , he ’ d be a gazillionaire .
 Romo hit peak prognostication when he announced the game two week ago in which Brady and the New England Patriots eked past the Kansas City Chiefs , earning yet another trip to the Super Bowl . He made 15 specific forecast . Thirteen were correct . On the two occasion when the team on offense bucked Romo ’ s soothsaying , “ the result were poor — one play ended with an incomplete pas , and the other with a turnover , ” noted Zach Helfand in The New Yorker . “ It seemed that , even when Romo wa wrong , he wa right . ”
 Romo , 38 , previously spent more than a decade a a quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys . He wa great but he wasn ’ t great , and with him a it leader , the team never went all the way . In a twist that ’ s testament to second act in American life , he ’ s doing something a a star for CBS that he never did a a star for the Cowboys : going to the Super Bowl . I suppose that ’ s fitting , because he ’ s more than great in his current gig . He ’ s peerless . And he ’ s a sensation .
 So much so that after the Patriots-Chiefs game , reporter for The Wall Street Journal studied 46 hour of television footage from this past football season to review the 2,599 play that Romo had provided live commentary for . Not even the Nixon Tapes got scrutiny like that . The Journal found 72 instance when Romo prophesied what a team wa about to do . The team did what he said 68 percent of the time .
 “ A broadcasting phenomenon ” is how The Journal describes Romo . Twitter call him Romostradamus . Football fan gush about Romomania . And this is obviously about more than the novelty of his crystal ball .
 It ’ s about the rarity of his unquestionably deep knowledge in an era when so many of the people who put on the trapping of authority and peddle pearl of wisdom don ’ t actually have the good . When so many opinion come with a swagger inversely proportional to their worth . When social medium , cable channel , webcasts , podcasts , blog and more have created an environment in which everybody ’ s an expert and nobody ’ s an expert — in which it ’ s sometimes impossible to tell .
 With Romo you can tell . His verified foresight prof his genuine insight .
 As I ’ ve savored his genius and reflected on it appeal , I ’ ve flashed back to some comment that President Obama made to The New Yorker ’ s top editor , David Remnick , for a lengthy article in late November 2016 about his waning day in office . Obama wa obsessed with the chaotic nature of this new information ecosystem . “ Everything is true and nothing is true , ” he told Remnick . “ An explanation of climate change from a Nobel Prize-winning physicist look exactly the same on your Facebook page a the denial of climate change by somebody on the Koch brother ’ payroll . ”
 I also flashed back to another article , by Amy Zegart , that appeared in The Atlantic the following summer . It defined the “ three paradox disrupting American politics , ” the first of which wa “ more information , le credibility . ”
 “ The volume of data is exploding , and yet credible information is harder to find , ” Zegart wrote . “ Why ? Because the barrier to entry are so low. ” You don ’ t need a printing press , a book contract or the approval of some gatekeeper to have your say and share your thought . You just need an internet connection . And while there ’ s obvious benefit to that — judgment and permission aren ’ t the exclusive province of a discriminatory elite — there ’ s obvious danger , too . Good filter disappear with the bad one . Cyberspace is at once a smorgasbord and a junkyard .
 Romo ’ s habitat — network television — is old-fashioned , but that ’ s not what distinguishes and recommends him . His seriousness set him apart . I don ’ t mean his style , which Helfand likened to “ that of a 10-year-old who ’ s really into dinosaur showing his uncle the T. rex exhibit at the American Museum of Natural History. ” I mean his content . He played football recently and ha studied it closely , so he understands what the athlete are thinking , what the coach are plotting , what make sense on third down and what doesn ’ t . He us the day between the game that he ’ s announcing to bone up on the team that will come under his gaze , even interviewing their member . While he come by his charisma naturally , he make it a point to be informed .
 How refreshing , and what an excellent reminder he is that hugely successful athlete aren ’ t just physically gifted ; they ’ re mentally tough , and many are smart . Their sport pivot on intricate strategy a much a brute strength . To the agile thinker go the spoil . Ever listened to one of those LeBron James news conference right after a basketball game ? He remembers and can deconstruct every second of it . It ’ s all there in his brain .
 Romo found glory aplenty on the football field , but he began to find even greater glory the minute he stepped off it in late 2016 , with a farewell speech that wa like the climactic monologue in one of those sport movie that ha grown men working every last muscle and tendon in their face not to cry .
 “ I just want to leave you with something I ’ ve learned in this process , ” he said , referring to his quarterbacking year . “ I feel like we all have two battle or two enemy going on . One with the man across from you . The second is with the man inside of you . I think once you control the one inside of you , the one across from you really doesn ’ t matter . ”
 Emotional intelligence along with clairvoyance : That ’ s no everyday combination . But then he ’ s no everyday oracle . You can tune in to the Super Bowl to marvel at Brady , chuckle over the commercial and gripe about the halftime show . Or you can come for Romo . He alone is lure enough .

 An Alabama transplant discovers what it take to find your place in New York City : a lot of trial and error .
 By Kim Velsey
 In New York , almost every living situation involves a trade-off of some kind . As Joseph Boudin discovered during his first few year in the city , figuring out how to balance the pro and con of various location , rent , roommate and apartment is a difficult art to master .
 Since moving from Alabama four year ago , Mr. Boudin , 25 , ha lived in five apartment , each a brief attempt to find a long-term home . After a year in Manhattan , he moved to Staten Island to save on rent , although he wa working in Midtown East . When he discovered the commute wa miserable , he overcorrected by moving into a Hell ’ s Kitchen room-share where his rent , at $ 1,875 , rivaled that of a studio apartment . And he still had to travel across town to work .
 Then he found a $ 1,200-a-month bedroom in an Upper East Side walk-up that turned out to be his worst calculation of all . Going in , he knew the accommodation wouldn ’ t be deluxe . The two-bedroom apartment wa small , shabby and on the sixth floor .
 “ When my best friend moved me in , she said , ‘ Joseph , are you sure you want to live here ? ’ ” Mr. Boudin recalled . “ There wa a hole around the bathroom pipe that wa the size of a dinner plate . ”
 What he didn ’ t know wa that his roommate ’ s brother would go from temporarily sleeping on the living-room futon to permanently living there . Or that his roommate would frequently rent his own room through Airbnb to make money , during which time he would also sleep in the living room .
 Making the cramped condition even more unpleasant , Mr. Boudin also had to contend with the brother ’ Labrador retriever . Contrary to the breed ’ s reputation , it wa anything but friendly .
 “ The dog wa huge and vicious — it really didn ’ t like me , ” Mr. Boudin said . “ I ’ d come home and the dog would be barking . And I couldn ’ t ever be in the living room because there wa always a dog or a person in there . ”
 Everyone , including the brother , agreed that the setup wa le than ideal . They were on good enough term , however , to decide that finding a larger apartment together wa the answer . The three were moving forward with plan to rent a three-bedroom in Williamsburg , Brooklyn , when Mr. Boudin reconsidered .
 “ All the red flag were up : First of all , it wa too small . Second , we ’ d still have the dog and the brother with u . The brother also wasn ’ t employed , so we would have had to pay his fee . And then there wa the L train shutting down , ” said Mr. Boudin , an account executive for a furniture company in Midtown .
 Earlier in the search , Mr. Boudin and his roommate had found a place through Rezi , a company that lease apartment wholesale from landlord and rent them to tenant at market rate . There is no broker ’ s fee , and once tenant are approved they can rent any Rezi apartment their income qualifies them for — in Mr. Boudin ’ s case , up to $ 2,300 a month .
 But the roommate hadn ’ t met Rezi ’ s qualification , so they looked elsewhere . Now , browsing the company ’ s listing , Mr. Boudin found several East Harlem studio for under $ 2,000 a month . If he could afford to live alone in Manhattan , he thought , he wasn ’ t going to live with roommate in Brooklyn .
 $ 1,725 | EAST HARLEM
 Occupation : Account executive at Walters , a furniture company.He immediately liked the apartment ’ s location : “ There ’ s a park , a church and a school nearby — those all seemed like good sign to me . There ’ s also a Target , Costco , Marshalls and Aldi . And one of the No . 1 restaurant in the city is right down the street from me , Rao ’ s , although I ’ ve never been there . I asked how long it take to get a reservation , and they said two years. ” Still , it ’ s fun to live near Rao ’ s : “ You ’ ll walk down the street at 5 or 6 p.m. and see Maseratis , limo coming down the street. ” Except for the smaller-than-average refrigerator , Mr. Boudin love the apartment ’ s renovation : “ All the fixture are so nice , there ’ s a washer-dryer , and I think the layout is great. ” Friends in the neighborhood : Mr. Boudin convinced a friend from Alabama to take an apartment a short walk away — also a Rezi listing — and now they frequently cook for one another . He ha also started volunteering at the Church of the Heavenly Rest on Fifth Avenue and 90th Street .
 In September , he signed a lease for a newly renovated , first-floor apartment on 114th Street , for $ 1,725 a month .
 “ I feel like I finally found my home . This place is a palace compared to the last place , ” Mr. Boudin said , marveling that he had gone from a bathroom with broken tile and a gaping hole in the floor to one with black marble and a waterfall shower head .
 Although his new living situation is more expensive than the previous one , it is still le than he wa paying for the Hell ’ s Kitchen apartment . And his commute , on the Second Avenue bus , take about 25 minute .
 He also love living on the first floor . “ The building is a walk-up , but I don ’ t have to walk up , so it ’ s like living in a luxury building , ” he said .
 And despite facing the street , he added , the noisiest thing in the apartment is usually the steam pipe .
 “ One time people were talking outside — it wa late — so I opened the curtain and said , ‘ Boo ! Can you please be quiet ? I ’ m trying to sleep , ’ ” Mr. Boudin said . “ They said , ‘ Oh , sorry , ’ and left . ”
 Even the difficulty of making it to an Equinox gym , where he had a membership , turned out to be a blessing in disguise : He joined a nearby Planet Fitness for $ 10 a month , a fraction of what he had been paying .
 Living alone ha also meant being able to his use his Ralph Lauren china and Tiffany crystalware — packed away after several mishap at the last apartment — on a daily basis .
 “ I ’ m definitely happy to be without roommate , ” he said . “ I ’ ve had some great one , but I never want to go back to the burden of roommate again . ”
 At his new apartment , he added , he is the only one sleeping on the sofa , an Ikea model he reupholstered in Ralph Lauren fabric using a sewing machine and a hot-glue gun .
 “ I bought a fold-up bed when I moved in , but I never use it , ” he said . “ The couch is a large a a twin-size bed , and I sleep fine . ”

 How to navigate a fractious , scandal-plagued year at the movie .
 By Reggie Ugwu
 We have gathered here today to discus not the artistic merit of this year ’ s Academy Award nominee for best picture ( that ’ s this way ) , but the controversy , firestorm and outright debacle that cling to them like dog hair to a dropped Tootsie Pop .
 Conveniently ( and infallibly ) labeled for the conscientious consumer , this is your guide to Oscar beef — from extra spicy to mild .
 [ Read our expert ’ s Oscar prediction , then fill out your ballot . ]
 The debate : The long-awaited ( some say cursed ) Queen biopic is a surprise international smash . Given all the good will toward the band , and Rami Malek , who play Freddie Mercury , that might have been enough to make it a populist cause célèbre , despite middling review from critic . But trouble started before the movie even wrapped .
 With two week of filming left to go , the director Bryan Singer wa fired for what the studio said were unexplained absence . Later , a man filed a lawsuit accusing Singer of sexually assaulting him at a yacht party in 2003 . ( Singer denied the allegation . ) And , in January , The Atlantic published the account of four others who said Singer had sex with them when they were underage . The director called the article a “ homophobic smear piece , ” but in response Bafta removed Singer a a nominee , and GLAAD rescinded a nomination for the film .
 Malek and the film ’ s producer have pointedly distanced themselves from Singer in speech and interview . But the director is still officially credited in “ Rhapsody ” ( owing to union rule ) and stand to earn a much a $ 40 million for his work on the film , according to The Hollywood Reporter .
 How hot is this beef ? Extra spicy . Even if you love “ Rhapsody , ” the Singer allegation give pause .
 The debate : Few movie in contention this year have been a divisive a “ Green Book , ” the earnest , civil rights-era , interracial buddy film directed by Peter Farrelly .
 The film is based on the true story of a black pianist ( Don Shirley , played by Mahershala Ali ) who hired a white driver and bodyguard ( Tony Vallelonga , played by Viggo Mortensen ) to chauffeur him on a tour across the Deep South in 1962 .
 Some controversy surrounding the movie involved cast or crew misstep : Mortensen used a racial epithet in a Q. and A. , then issued an apology . Farrelly ’ s history of jokingly exposing himself on set resurfaced , and he also issued an apology . And a story about an anti-Muslim tweet from the screenwriter Nick Vallelonga ( son of the driver ) led him to issue an apology .
 But there are larger criticism of the movie . Many have argued that it simplified , feel-good message distorts history . And that wa before member of Shirley ’ s family publicly condemned the film , calling it “ a symphony of lie . ”
 Nick Vallelonga ha said that he based his story on conversation with Shirley himself .
 How hot is this beef ? Extra spicy . A recent spike in hate crime and the concern of African-American audience have justifiably raised the bar for film about racial reconciliation in America . “ Green Book ” may not have the gear to clear it .
 The debate : With this madcap , stylistically varied portrait of Dick Cheney and the world he made , Adam McKay hoped to repeat the magic trick he pulled off with “ The Big Short ” : turning convoluted recent history into fun and informative popcorn fare . This time , though , some critic have tagged McKay ’ s version of event a both vacuous and paternalistic , suggesting that the director wa out of his depth . A pair of fourth-wall-breaking post-credits sequence , in which the viewing audience is implicated directly , didn ’ t help .
 How hot is this beef ? Medium . Unless Amy Adams ( nominated for her performance a Lynne Cheney ) is snubbed , then call 911 .
 The debate : Spike Lee is finally getting a victory lap thanks to the box office and critical success of this film , about a black police officer who infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan in the 1970s . “ BlacKkKlansman ” is nominated for six Oscars , including best director , the first time Lee ha been honored in that category . But some observer , including Boots Riley , the director of “ Sorry to Bother You , ” have noted that the film take more than a few liberty with the historical record , and accused Lee of ginning up a false , feel-good story about a police department on the right side of history . Lee ha defended himself by pointing to his long track record on civil right and suggesting that he shouldn ’ t be expected to be critical of all police all of the time . “ Black people are not a monolithic group , ” he told The Times of London .
 How hot is this beef ? Medium . But what fun would a Spike Lee Joint be without anything to argue about ?
 The debate : The director Alfonso Cuarón ’ s love letter to the Mexico City neighborhood where he grew up , and the woman who raised him , ha swept up 10 nomination . Its star , Yalitza Aparicio , is the first Indigenous Mexican woman to be nominated for best actress . But some have criticized Aparicio ’ s character , Cleo , a working-class Indigenous nanny based on Cuarón ’ s childhood caregiver , a thinly drawn and lacking in agency . Did Cuarón , who is white and grew up well-off , overreach in telling her story ?
 “ Roma ” is also the first Netflix original film to receive a best picture nomination . That ha stirred the anxiety of movie-theater loyalist , who in turn have annoyed everyone else by insisting that the film is best viewed on the big screen .
 How hot is this beef ? Mild . The question of Cleo ’ s agency seems reasonably open to interpretation . And Liboria “ Libo ” Rodriguez , the real-life inspiration for the character , is a compelling advocate on the film ’ s behalf .
 The debate : Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga ’ s ode to authentic creative expression and the vocal benefit of gargling gravel once seemed like a crowd-pleasing no-brainer for an award show famously obsessed with A-listers and the mythology of show business . But it lost steam early in the race . More than a few critic have pointed out it evidently shame-y view on the pleasure of both pop music and makeup ; it portrayal of drag queen raised some eyebrow .
 How hot is this beef ? Mild . Are you happy in this modern world ? Or do you need more ? Compared with the other film on this list , Cooper ’ s is still about a close to universally beloved a it get in 2019 ( even if Oscar voter were cold to the director himself ) .
 The debate : What wa that we were saying about universal love ? Clearly , last year ’ s highest-grossing movie domestically is more than within scratching distance of that claim , too . Ryan Coogler ’ s Pan-African Marvel epic didn ’ t need a “ popular film ” category to score plenty of recognition from Academy voter , including the first-ever best picture nomination for a superhero film . But some have wondered : Does the arrival of the Avengers and Co. to Hollywood ’ s most exclusive club signal the end of civilization ? What will become of the true cinema and all that gatekeeper and other Curators of Cinematic Kindred Spirits hold dear ?
 Critics of the politics of the film , which touch on messy question about racial justice without ever really getting it hand dirty , have been more thoughtful .
 How hot is this beef ? Mild . Unless you hate child , who are the future .
 The debate : This biting and bawdy period comedy from the acclaimed Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos tied with “ Roma ” for the most nomination this year at 10 . Its story , based on the real-life palace intrigue involving Queen Anne and her female consort , gleefully skewer the stuffy convention of it genre , provoking some who have groused about it many anachronism .
 How hot is this beef ? Mild . Don ’ t cry for the crown .

 Ramy Youssef wa home , in a manner of speaking . The Egyptian-American stand-up comedian had just finished shooting several take of a scene for his new Hulu show , “ Ramy. ” The set wa a mock-up of his childhood New Jersey home and the scene took place inside the dining room . Pictures of Youssef and his sister were hanging on the wall .
 “ It wa actually kind of emotional when I walked in because I hadn ’ t seen it , ” Youssef , 28 , said last fall a he stood outside his faux-home , which wa built in a Brooklyn studio . He added : “ It doesn ’ t feel exactly like my house but the emotional correctness is totally there . It ’ s the right vibe . ”
 The house look like many middle-class suburban home : A living room , dining room , kitchen , all unremarkable .
 But what is remarkable about “ Ramy ” isn ’ t that it significantly differs from other millennial coming-of-age story . It ’ s that it doesn ’ t .
 The comedy , debuting Friday , tell the story of a young American Muslim grappling with his faith along with the usual array of 20-something pressure : romance , career aspiration , drug , parent . It ’ s a simple formula , but after decade of Muslims being depicted onscreen a terrorist and villain or otherwise pushed to the side , it ’ s practically revolutionary .
 [ Our review : “ Ramy ” is a soulful , funny leap of faith . ]
 “ On one level , it ’ s very clear that there ’ s nothing out like it , ” Youssef said . “ There ’ s this initial reaction that you have of : ‘ Oh , man . I have a lot of responsibility . I have this responsibility to speak for my people. ’ Then you start to make the thing and you ’ re like : ‘ That ’ s an impossible goal . If I try to do that , it just won ’ t work . ’ ”
 He continued , “ The more that I got into the process , I realized all I can do is really offer my singular point of view , and make sure that it ’ s a much me a possible , and that will speak to who we need to speak to . ”
 Portrayals of Muslims in Western pop culture have historically lacked nuance . If they ’ re depicted at all , it is usually a the bad guy — see “ True Lies , ” “ 24 , ” and “ Homeland , ” among many other example . Jack G. Shaheen , a professor and author who spent much of his life cataloging how Hollywood ha stereotyped Muslims and Arabs , said before his death in 2017 that anti-Muslim prejudice onscreen were a bad a they ’ ve ever been , which he cited a a contributing factor to a low view of Islam among Americans . In 2017 , a poll conducted by the Pew Research Center showed a warming view of Muslims in the United States , but still the lowest among other religious group in the survey , including Jews , Catholics , and evangelical Christians .
 In 2010 , the broadcaster Katie Couric suggested a possible solution to change attitude about Islam in the United States : “ Maybe we need a Muslim version of ‘ The Cosby Show. ’ ” Aasif Mandvi , the former correspondent for “ The Daily Show , ” gave it a shot with a 2015 Funny or Die spoof called “ Halal in the Family . ”
 But attempt to seriously address the issue have become more common in recent year . In 2017 , in a widely hailed speech in the British House of Commons , the actor Riz Ahmed spoke about the importance of onscreen representation .
 “ If we fail to represent , we are in danger of losing people to extremism , ” Ahmed said .
 After Ahmed ’ s speech gained publicity , Sadia Habib and Shaf Choudry , an academic and a tech consultant in Britain , created the Riz Test , the Muslim equivalent of the Bechdel Test , which set criterion for judging Muslim portrayal in film and television . ( A representative for Ahmed said he wa unavailable for comment . )
 Among the category : Are the character “ presented a irrationally angry ? ” or “ talking about , the victim of , or the perpetrator of terrorism ? ”
 “ The general portrayal is obviously quite negative , ” Dr. Habib said in an interview . “ It almost serf to perpetuate this idea that Muslims are quite backward , culturally deficit , and you get quite a lot of contradiction . ”
 Recent project that failed the test include the BBC hit “ Bodyguard , ” Amazon ’ s “ Jack Ryan ” and even the smash Marvel movie “ Black Panther ” where , in an early scene , a terrorist scream , “ Wallahi , I will shoot her ! ” — Wallahi , in Arabic , mean “ I swear to Allah ” — after the main character T ’ Challa ( Chadwick Boseman ) go to rescue Nakia ( Lupita Nyong ’ o ) .
 “ The awareness that there wa nothing like it wa what pushed me to make it even more unique , because there ’ s never been a Muslim family show , ” Youssef said . “ I didn ’ t want to give the Muslim family the same treatment that is given to the Asian family show and the Hispanic family show . There are almost kind of trope of how an immigrant family is treated on television , and I felt like , ‘ No , this need to go even further than that . ’ ”
 “ All those thing were driven by the reality that we have no other portrayal outside of the news , ” he added .
 In “ Ramy ” Youssef play a version of himself embracing Islam . It ’ s not the only authentically Muslim story told in recent year : “ The Big Sick , ” the 2017 movie written by Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V. Gordon , wa nominated for an Oscar and told the story about Nanjiani and Gordon ’ s real- life romance .
 The difference between “ Ramy ” and “ The Big Sick ” is that Nanjiani spent much of that story trying to run away from his faith , whereas Youssef fully welcome religious aspect of Islam . And in the non-scripted realm , the comedian Hasan Minhaj discus his culture and faith with regularity on his Netflix show , “ Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj . ”
 If “ Ramy ” is not exactly a Muslim “ Cosby Show ” — this version is far more vulgar — Youssef , who also ha a stand-up special debuting on HBO on June 29 , can claim credit for acing the Riz Test .
 “ If that ’ s how it is , I have hope for it , ” Dr. Habib said . “ It will change the narrative and it will maybe open the floodgate for more show like this about Muslims . ”
 The Ramy of the show ha to reconcile his faith with the demand of being a young adult in New Jersey . He said that while his character on the show wasn ’ t an exact replica of himself , “ a lot of the rule that are in the show are kind of the one that I do have for myself personally. ” Most of his love interest early in the season are white and do not understand why he doesn ’ t drink or do drug . He ha deep conversation at his mosque about how to properly wash his foot and what his place is in the world . ( Youssef doesn ’ t completely avoid caricature in the show : His uncle , played by Laith Nakli , is cartoonishly homophobic and anti-Semitic . )
 At the same time , “ Ramy ” explores many of the same issue a other contemporary show about young adult trying to get by , like HBO ’ s “ Girls ” and “ Insecure. ” Along with the push-and-pull of his faith , Ramy contends with meddling relative , selfish friend , dating woe and career struggle .
 “ I do believe in God , ” Youssef said . “ I realized that there wa this void in entertainment of someone talking about that genuine construct . I have a bit about it I do all the time about how there ’ s Friday prayer , and then there ’ s Friday night , where it ’ s like : ‘ No , I want to do both . I want to pray , and then , I also go out , and I have a girlfriend . ’ ”
 Born in Queens and raised mostly in Rutherford , N.J. , Youssef began conceiving the show when he dropped out of Rutgers University at 20 and moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in acting . Being on the opposite coast of his family , he found more solace in Islam than he had ever found before .
 During one of his first acting job , on Nickelodeon ’ s “ See Dad Run , ” the show wa “ shooting at Paramount Pictures and I remember praying at Paramount , ” Youssef said . “ I had this thought where I wa like : ‘ Who else ha done this ? Who ha prayed on this lot ? ’ ”
 His stand-up and acting career started taking off . ( I have performed multiple stand-up show with Youssef over the year . ) Youssef began dabbling in comedy with a sketch group in high school and then stand-up in Los Angeles . He started touring with Jerrod Carmichael . In 2017 , he landed his most high-profile appearance to date : a set on “ The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. ” That same year , he pitched his own show to several outlet , including Hulu .
 “ For someone who wa doing a show for the first time , he just knew what his show wa , ” Beatrice Springborn , Hulu ’ s vice president of original programming , said . “ He also knew how to take his experience of being a first generation Muslim-American and make it feel like every millennial ’ s experience . ”
 Youssef acknowledged that he would not have been able to make this show a decade ago — the explosion of streaming platform ha created more opportunity for more diverse perspective and talent . ( Steve Way , an actor born with muscular dystrophy , play a close friend of Youssef . ) It ha also created room for formal experimentation .
 “ We take a lot of tonal and storytelling risk , ” he said . “ We have episode that I ’ m not even in . ”
 One episode depicts experiencing the Sept. 11 terrorist attack solely through a young version of the central character . The episode , which Youssef directed but doe not appear in , is indicative of the show ’ s balancing act — it delivers Youssef ’ s distinct point of view while also giving a broader portrayal of the Muslim experience in the United States .
 “ I think a lot of people look at Muslims and they think every day , the moderate Muslim or the good Muslim — it ’ s almost like we all have this choice every morning that ’ s like , ISIS or breakfast , ” Youssef said .
 “ As if that ’ s like a genuine temptation , ” he continued . “ I don ’ t know anyone who know anything about anyone who ’ s ever been in ISIS . We ’ ve got nothing to do with any of that . Really placing what our actual issue are , and what our actual thing are at the forefront is the thing that I think make u most human . That ’ s what I want people to see . ”

 You all know that Peter Parker is your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man . For many year , that neighborhood wa officially Forest Hills , Queens .
 He even lived at a real address : 20 Ingram Street . And in 2001 , a few month before the first Spider-Man movie came out , a reporter for The Queens Tribune discovered that a family named Parker wa living there .
 Even more improbable , across the street lived a family named Osborne , nearly identical to the last name of Spider-Man ’ s archenemy , Norman Osborn .
 But that wa a long time ago .
 Things have changed .
 A new Spider-Man movie hit theater last month , and on Tuesday , it wa nominated for an Oscar , for best animated feature . In the new movie , Spider-Man — who debuted in 1962 — ha a new story line . Peter Parker , who is white , ha been replaced , sort of , by a biracial teenager named Miles Morales who life in Brooklyn .
 It ’ s part of a trend to diversify comic book character to appeal to and better represent their audience .
 For instance , Ms. Marvel is a teenage Muslim girl living in Jersey City ; the new Hulk is Korean-American .
 As it turn out , Peter Parker ’ s old stamping ground have changed , too .
 The real-life Parkers no longer live at 20 Ingram Street ; the Osbornes are no longer across the street .
 Both white family have been replaced by Asian family , according to Lauren , a young Korean-American who life in the Osbornes ’ old house . ( She asked me not to publish her last name . )
 Lauren wa well aware of Spider-Man ’ s connection to the block . People still take picture of 20 Ingram Street , she said .
 As for relocating Spider-Man to that other borough , well …
 “ Brooklyn isn ’ t the same anymore , ” Lauren said , noting how fast the borough ha gentrified . If the goal wa to change the story line to make it “ not a white , ” she said , “ I don ’ t know if Brooklyn is the right place . ”
 She added , “ I ’ m sure in a couple of year thing will be changing again . ”

 You don ’ t really need to call it a “ Super Blood Wolf Moon . ”
 By Nicholas St. Fleur
 Skygazers across the Western Hemisphere will be treated to celestial eye candy on Sunday night into early Monday morning a the full moon turn coppery red during a total lunar eclipse . It will be the only total lunar eclipse of the year , and that in itself should be reason enough to stay up late and marvel a the moon get swallowed by Earth ’ s shadow .
 You might have heard that this eclipse is also being called a “ Super Blood Wolf Moon. ” But a astronomer know , no number of edgy modifier could make this display of cosmic clockwork any cooler .
 [ Sign up to get reminder for space and astronomy event on your calendar . ]
 Unlike a total solar eclipse , when the moon moseys between the sun and the Earth , it ’ s our planet that slide between the sun and the moon during a total lunar eclipse . As the Earth block the sun , only sliver of light make it through the planet ’ s atmosphere and to the moon .
 “ If you were standing on the surface of the moon when this event wa happening , and you were staring back at the Earth , what you would see is this beautiful reddish-orangish tinted ring , ” said Jackie Faherty , an astrophysicist at the American Museum of Natural History .
 That ring of light is made up of every sunrise and sunset happening on Earth at that moment in time . It ’ s the same light that make the moon look red to those of u on Earth during the eclipse .
 This eclipse will be visible in the night sky across North and South America . Skywatchers in part of Europe and Africa will see part of or the entire eclipse in their predawn sky .
 Just before 9:30 p.m. Eastern Time in New York , a bright moon wa visible in the sky over Manhattan to the southeast . A weather forecast suggested cloud cover in the area would fall slightly during the time frame of the eclipse . Winter storm and cloudy sky could make viewing the moon difficult in part of the United States .
 People living in Asia and Australia will not see this eclipse , unfortunately .
 The opening act start Sunday night at 9:36 p.m. Eastern Time a the moon first enters Earth ’ s outer shadow , also called the penumbra . Darkness will creep up the lower left portion of the moon , almost imperceptibly .
 At about 10:34 p.m. , the moon will start to enter Earth ’ s inner shadow , or the umbra . This mark the beginning of the partial lunar eclipse , when it will appear a if something took a bite out of the moon .
 [ Read about the meteorite that slammed into the moon during the eclipse . ]
 At 11:41 p.m. , the moon will enter totality and turn completely red a it is devoured by Earth ’ s umbral shadow . It will stay this way for about one hour , and at 12:12 a.m. on Monday , it will reach the darkest part of Earth ’ s shadow , appearing to be at it most coppery red .
 “ The moon becomes 10,000 time dimmer than what it wa , ” said Brian Murphy , director of the Holcomb Observatory and Planetarium at Butler University in Indianapolis . “ Because it is so dim at that point , you ’ ll be able to see star right around the moon. ” That ’ s interesting , he said , because full moon tend to be so bright that they outshine star in their celestial neighborhood .
 As it begin to exit the umbral shadow at 12:44 a.m. , the moon will start to brighten . By 2:48 a.m. , the moon will return to it usual brightness , and the eclipse will be completely over .
 People on the West Coast have a better time slot to watch the show because totality will occur between 8:41 p.m. and 9:44 p.m. Pacific Time .
 Never miss an eclipse , a meteor shower , a rocket launch or any other astronomical and space event that 's out of this world .
 That ’ s the best thing about this celestial show : As long a you ’ re located on the half of the planet that will experience the eclipse , you can watch it from nearly anywhere , weather permitting .
 Dark sky are always a plus , but your backyard or city street will work just fine . No need for fancy equipment , a your two eye are all you need .
 But if you want to enhance your experience , binoculars will let you better see the whole picture a the moon ’ s surface change color .
 You can watch the lunar eclipse online . The Slooh Community Observatory , a telescope broadcast service , will live-stream the event from the Canary Islands and Chile starting around 10:30 p.m. Eastern Time on Sunday . Timeanddate.com will also host a broadcast .
 This lunar eclipse ha been given a name that sound like it belongs to a heavy metal band . But it ’ s really all glitter , not gold . So let ’ s break it down :
 The term “ supermoon ” ha come to loosely mean a full moon near perigee , or the point when it is closest to Earth in it elliptical orbit . Normally when this happens , most people can ’ t tell , a the moon appears only slightly bigger than it doe any other night .
 But when compared with the moon at apogee , when it is farthest away from the Earth , the difference come into focus . For example , on Monday during perigee , the moon will be approximately 222,040 mile away from our planet , in contrast to Jan. 9 , when it wa at apogee and about 252,350 mile away . A “ supermoon ” is about 14 percent larger than one at apogee and 30 percent brighter .
 But this term wa actually first coined in 1979 by an astrologist named Richard Nolle , not by an astronomer .
 This is an embellishment of the coppery-red tint that the moon take on during any lunar eclipse . Sometimes it ’ s more brown .
 Nothing to do with werewolf .
 The “ wolf ” title ha been attributed to the Native Americans ’ name for January ’ s full moon . According to The Old Farmer ’ s Almanac , the term come from the “ Algonquin tribe who lived in region from New England to Lake Superior. ” But this sourcing is suspect .
 “ The ‘ wolf ’ part , it ’ s almost like this stereotypical , romanticized version of the native culture , ” said Annette Lee , an expert in indigenous astronomy at St . Cloud State University in Minnesota , who is also mixed-race Lakota .
 The term , she said , is an oversimplification that sort of group hundred of distinct Native American tribe together into one blob . For example , the Ojibwe tribe — which historically lived around Lake Superior and is a part of the Algonquin-language family — called both the month of January and it full moon the “ Great Spirit Moon , ” she said . In their language , it is “ Gichi-manidoo-giizis , ” according to Ojibwe.net .
 “ I think the problem with ‘ The Wolf Moon ’ is that it take something that is really important and really meaningful out of it cultural context , ” she said . As a result , “ it doesn ’ t have the substance that it need for people to really learn about the culture in a dignified way . ”
 There are two more “ supermoons ” on Feb. 19 and March 21 this year , though neither will be a “ blood moon . ”
 There will also be two solar eclipse — a total solar eclipse visible in part of South America in July and a year-ending annular , or “ ring of fire , ” eclipse on Dec. 26 , which will be visible over the Arabian Peninsula and India .
 Nov. 11 also mark a Mercury transit , which is when people at point on the East Coast can watch the solar system ’ s innermost planet make a six-hour long trek across the sun .

 Past Tense
 More than 50 year of eight million people standing , folding and eating together .

 Pizza can be a great divider in New York . In fact , one of the easiest way to get into argument ( without end ) is to name a “ best pizza in the city. ” But at the same time , pizza — specifically the reheated , foldable , portable slice — is one of the city ’ s great uniters . There is no culinary experience that New Yorkers share more widely and more unanimously than the slice joint . Like catching a sunset over the skyline or stepping in an icy curbside puddle , the slice joint ha , since it beginning more than 50 year ago , become common currency .
 The price ha changed over the decade , but the scene and staging remain much the same . Look at the crowd of New Yorkers and tourist alike bundled in winter coat on a recent Wednesday night at Joe ’ s Pizza on Carmine Street . The pie at Joe ’ s , which opened in 1975 , are considered among the city ’ s best . See how the customer rotate in a perfect line through the door and up to the glass case , their order ready and their money in hand . “ Three dollar , ” the pizza man say briskly , after he ha placed the requested slice into a decked oven . Out come the hot , bubbling triangle of cheese and sauce on thin , pliable crust . Once their slice are ready , the diner — if so formal a word even applies — grab a place at the counter in the window or push out the door , slice in hand , on to wherever the evening may take them . This is the “ New York style . ”
 The origin story of New York pizza start with large wave of Italian immigrant settling in the city in the late 19th and early 20th century . By 1920 , roughly a quarter of the 1.6 million Italian immigrant in the United States were living in New York , establishing enclave in Manhattan , Brooklyn and the Bronx . Such neighborhood were home to the first pizzeria , like Lombardi ’ s in Little Italy , which opened on Spring Street in 1905 . The namesake of the Neapolitan immigrant Gennaro Lombardi , the restaurant used a coal-fired oven to create pizza with puffy , charred crust and a bubbling layer of tomato sauce and cheese that made it one of the most popular restaurant in Little Italy . As if in biblical succession , a apprentice left to start their own pizza operation , Lombardi ’ s begat Totonno ’ s in Coney Island , John ’ s in Greenwich Village and Patsy ’ s in what is now Spanish Harlem . These are the four acknowledged prewar pizza pillar in the city . ( Though none of them wa a slice joint in the current sense . )
 Hot , filling and eaten with the hand , pizza elicited breathless coverage from The Times fairly early on , a food writer marveled at the appealing combination of ingredient and convenience . By 1947 , the paper wa fully sold . “ A round of dough is baked with tomato and anchovy and cheese atop , cut into wedge , then eaten with the finger between gulp of wine , ” the food editor Jane Nickerson enthused . “ The pizza could be a popular a snack a the hamburger if Americans only knew more about it . ”
 Nine year later , The Times ’ s Herbert Mitgang contemplated the reason for pizza ’ s popularity , writing , “ The guess is that a number of Americans of Italian origin , aided by advertising and refrigeration , have made pizza a delectable a such other postwar import a Lollobrigida ” — referring to Gina , the saucy Roman film star . The Neapolitan-style pie became a chic dinner-party staple that could also be supplemented with a salad for a filling , family meal . But one innovation would change how New Yorkers enjoyed pizza forever .
 Frank Mastro , an Italian immigrant and businessman , saw the potential for pizza to be a popular in America a the hot dog . He just had to figure out a way to make it quicker and cheaper for both restaurant owner and diner . So in the mid-1930s , he devised a gas pizza oven that maintained optimal temperature even a the door wa opened over and over .
 Although it is hard to pinpoint when pizza wa first sold by the slice , the introduction of the gas oven with multiple deck gave New Yorkers the option of enjoying a crisp-bottomed slice either a a full meal or a substantial snack between meal a they moved around the city . Pizza shop owner no longer needed to learn how to operate a coal-fired oven , meaning pizza could be made quicker and with le training . By the 1960s , the slice joint boom wa on . And it is the slice joint that really turned pizza from an Italian food in New York City into a New York City food — a meal shared across neighborhood , ethnicity and age group , equally at home in the Bay Ridge of “ Saturday Night Fever ” a in the Bedford-Stuyvesant of “ Do the Right Thing . ”
 This proliferation wa also helped along by the same thing that brought pizza to this country in the first place : immigration . In the ’ 60 and ’ 70 , wave of immigrant from Eastern Europe , the Caribbean and Latin America began joining the work force and landing in food service role , where the barrier to entry wa much lower than in other field .
 As one of the standard-bearer of the current slice-joint renaissance , Scarr Pimentel remembers his spot on 138th Street and Broadway . “ Kids like me pretty much grew up in pizza shop , ” said Mr. Pimentel , whose family moved to New York from the Dominican Republic . “ If you had five buck you could have a slice , a soda and some ice cream . It wa a full meal and sometimes the owner would slip u an extra slice or something. ” Mr. Pimentel opened his own pizza shop in 2016 , the sleek and retro Scarr ’ s Pizza on the Lower East Side . His slice and pie are made with organic flour , high-quality tomato and cheese and carefully sourced ( often organic ) topping , but the slice-joint spirit hold true . “ Who would ’ ve thought a kid like me from the Dominican Republic would own a pizza shop in New York City one day ? ” he added .
 John Kambouris immigrated to Washington Heights in 1965 from a small Greek island about 200 mile east of Athens . “ I had $ 10 in my pocket , ” he said from behind the counter of Pizza Palace on Dyckman Street , which he ha owned since 1979 , when he bought the business from an Italian couple he knew from the neighborhood . “ They say the Italians bring the pizza here , but we put our culture on it. ” In the 1960s this area wa Irish and Jewish , he explained . Today , the neighborhood is home to a large Caribbean population , including a large concentration of immigrant from the Dominican Republic . “ I love what I ’ m doing … we ’ re making pizza that people want and I don ’ t have to be Italian to make good pizza , ” Mr. Kambouris said , before noting , “ I ’ ve put three kid through college off of this shop . ”
 It ’ s in hundred of shop like his around the city , many no bigger than subway car , where you ’ ll find New Yorkers shoulder to shoulder , eating slice in near silence . “ Teens , Wall Street guy , guy camped out with a shopping cart , a pizza place is the most diverse space in the city , ” said Colin Atrophy Hagendorf , author of “ Slice Harvester : A Memoir in Pizza ” and host of the Radio Harvester podcast . “ Inside a pizzeria that dream of diverse New York City is a reality . I think that ’ s such a beautiful thing . ”

 The past two week have been some of the most hectic of the award-season calendar , but no one ha been busier than Alfonso Cuarón .
 The 57-year-old Mexican director wa a big winner at the Golden Globes on Jan. 6 , when his black-and-white film “ Roma , ” which chronicle a young domestic worker and the Mexico City family she work for , picked up prize for best director and best foreign-language film .
 The next day , Cuarón flew across the country to attend the New York Film Critics Circle Awards , where he wa honored for directing and cinematography and where “ Roma ” took best film , before heading back to the West Coast for more award presented by the Los Angeles Film Critics Association , including cinematography and best picture win .
 And then , after squeezing in some last-minute event during the final day of voting for the Oscar nomination — including a Chateau Marmont party held by Charlize Theron and Diego Luna — Cuarón wa spirited to the Critics ’ Choice Awards in Santa Monica on Sunday night . There , “ Roma ” picked up four more prize : best foreign film , cinematography , director and the final award for best picture .
 No other movie ha won more trophy this past week , or critical laurel over the entire season . But can “ Roma ” make history next month by winning the best picture Oscar , or is there still a ceiling on how high this Netflix-distributed art film can go ?
 First , let ’ s talk about all the thing “ Roma ” ha in it favor . Foremost among them is passion , and “ Roma ” fan are positively evangelical .
 I ’ ve spoken to industry voter who prefer film like “ A Star Is Born , ” “ Green Book ” and “ Bohemian Rhapsody , ” but many of them are almost bashful when divulging their ultimate pick . Not so “ Roma ” voter , who will shout their ardor from the rooftop . They feel an intense connection to Cuarón ’ s film , and though “ Roma ” begin quietly , the film build to some emotionally harrowing sequence that these audience haven ’ t been able to shake .
 Cuarón is no stranger to an award-season campaign — he won the best director Oscar for his last film , “ Gravity ” — and among this year ’ s aspirant , he is one of the warmest and most accessible auteur . I sat at the “ Roma ” table at the Critics ’ Choice Awards , and no commercial break went by without a procession of well-wisher making their way to Cuarón and his leading lady , Yalitza Aparicio and Marina de Tavira , to pay respect , which the director received with a big smile .
 It reminded me of the campaign waged last year by Cuarón ’ s friend Guillermo del Toro , whose “ The Shape of Water ” took home the top two Oscars . I talked to many academy member that season whose vote wa secured once they caught del Toro at a Q & A : They initially liked the film , but that deepened into love after the director passionately contextualized it . Cuarón drew much of “ Roma ” from his own experience growing up in Mexico City during the 1970s , and that personal link will count for a lot .
 [ Alfonso Cuarón take u around Mexico City . ]
 All this might be for naught if it weren ’ t for Netflix ’ s deep-pocketed award bid . Foreign-language Oscar contender usually merit a scant few tastemaker party if they ’ re lucky , but Netflix ha mounted a “ Roma ” campaign more akin to what you ’ d give a Marvel movie . Hollywood is blanketed in billboard bearing Aparicio ’ s face , “ Roma ” event are thrown nearly round the clock , and many industry figure received a heavy $ 175 book about the film published by Assouline . Rival publicist estimate that Netflix is spending $ 10 million to $ 20 million on award-season promotion , though some put that figure even higher .
 It ’ s an unprecedented campaign for a black-and-white foreign film , but then , a best picture win for Netflix would be unprecedented , too . The streaming service ha never so much a fielded a best-picture nominee , and the company is gunning for the win .
 Still , strain of anti-Netflix sentiment remain , and that ’ s one of the headwind facing “ Roma. ” Many in the industry fear that the theatrical component of moviegoing will be depreciated a Netflix continues to gain ground , and though the streaming service tried to assuage those concern by giving “ Roma ” a brief , exclusive theatrical window , the imminent arrival of Disney and Apple in the streaming space will only pull more focus from traditional distribution method .
 There is also the fact that no foreign-language film ha ever won best picture . The closest analog may be “ The Artist , ” another black-and-white movie that took the prize seven year ago , but though it wa made by the French director Michel Hazanavicius and starred French lead , it wa ultimately a Hollywood-set film made in English . In the academy ’ s yearslong bid to increase diversity , it ha begun courting a far more international membership , but a foreign-language best picture win would still prove notable in a year with plenty of homegrown Hollywood product to choose from .
 I also wonder if Aparicio ’ s lack of best-actress traction may indicate that passion for “ Roma ” is high but not wide . Though she wa nominated at the Critics ’ Choice Awards ( losing to Glenn Close and Lady Gaga , who tied ) , she wa snubbed by the Golden Globes and Screen Actors Guild , and the latter is particularly concerning given that actor make up the academy ’ s biggest voting branch .
 Foreign-language performer like Isabelle Huppert ( “ Elle ” ) and Marion Cotillard ( “ Two Days , One Night ” ) have broken into the best-actress category without the benefit of Netflix ’ s marketing money or the heat of a major best-picture contender , so if she ’ s left out of the final five when Oscar nomination are announced next week , Netflix ought to be concerned : Only 11 film have gone on to win best picture without scoring any acting nomination .
 It ’ s enough to keep Cuarón on his toe despite all those laurel from critic , and this unpredictable best-picture race is starting to become the sort of battle between art and commerce hinted at when the academy tried to introduce an Oscar for best popular film . Though “ Roma ” is more widely available than nearly any other Oscar contender by dint of it streaming distribution , it ’ s still an art movie that open with a long , unbroken shot of washed pavement , showing on a service that ha gotten impatient viewer accustomed to a “ skip intro ” feature .
 Several huge hit are likely to be in the Oscar mix this year : “ A Star Is Born ” and Golden Globe winner “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” will both vie to be the biggest best-picture winner at the box office since “ Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King , ” while “ Black Panther ” would be the highest-grossing film to ever win that top prize . Might they all be beaten by a foreign-language film whose theatrical gross weren ’ t even reported ? In an eccentric Oscar season , that might be the ultimate twist .

 WASHINGTON — Standing before a diverse new class of House Democrats , in the shadow of their new female speaker , President Trump showed on Tuesday how he planned to govern in a divided Washington .
 The answer , judging by his word , is no differently than he did before .
 Mr. Trump briefly acknowledged Nancy Pelosi a “ Madam Speaker , ” but dispensed with even perfunctory congratulation . He all but ignored the midterm election that swept the Republican Party out of power in the House . And he vowed that the United States “ will never be a socialist country , ” likening the progressive Democrats in the chamber to the discredited leader of Venezuela .
 The president did issue a call for bipartisan cooperation , and he invoked the heroism of World War II to celebrate a shared history . But on the issue that have rived Washington during Mr. Trump ’ s turbulent presidency , he did not give an inch .
 Whether it wa the border wall , which he insisted would be built ; abortion , where he tried to fan conservative anger over comment made by Virginia ’ s governor ; or the investigation of his presidential campaign ’ s tie to Russia , which he dismissed a “ ridiculous ” and “ partisan , ” Mr. Trump chose to appeal to his political base rather than trying to build bridge to Democrats .
 “ If there is going to be peace and legislation , ” he declared , setting out the term of his engagement with Congress , “ there can not be war and investigation . It just doesn ’ t work that way ! ”
 Save for the majesty of the setting , the president ’ s adherence to his script , and a single unscripted moment when Mr. Trump tipped his hat to the score of Democratic woman elected to Congress last November , part of this State of the Union speech could have been drawn from one of his “ Make America Great Again ” rally .
 Mr. Trump warned of a new wave of invading caravan from Central America , spoke of grisly crime committed by illegal immigrant and accused what he said were wealthy politician who oppose his immigration policy — presumably including Ms. Pelosi — of favoring open border while “ living their life behind wall and gate and guard . ”
 “ No issue better illustrates the divide between America ’ s working class and political class than illegal immigration , ” he said .
 In front of him , however , the divide wa between the mostly male Republicans , who applauded his red-meat line , and the Democrats , many of them woman , who were clad in white to signify the woman ’ s suffrage movement .
 Mr. Trump delighted in his role a the dismantler of Democratic legacy : He boasted of eliminating a “ very unpopular ” provision of Obamacare , withdrawing the United States from the “ disastrous Iran nuclear deal ” and renegotiating the “ catastrophe known a Nafta . ”
 As for how the Republicans and Democrats might work together , Mr. Trump revived his proposal for infrastructure legislation , calling it “ not an option ” but a “ necessity. ” But he offered no detail and breezed through the proposal , which is le popular among Republicans , in barely three line , half a much time a he gave his campaign to reduce the price of prescription drug .
 Even Mr. Trump ’ s conciliatory phrase carried a partisan sting . He said , for example , “ the agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda , ” using a shortened form of Democratic that some Republicans favor a a mild slur against the opposing party .
 For a president whose party lost 40 seat in the House three month ago , and who just lost a battle with Ms. Pelosi over the 35-day government shutdown , Mr. Trump behaved like the insurgent who rode into Washington two year ago with a congressional majority and a mandate to upend the establishment .
 He claimed credit for a long list of economic and national security achievement , some of which were almost comically exaggerated . “ If I had not been elected president of the United States , ” he said , “ we would right now , in my opinion , be in a major war with North Korea . ”
 New York Times reporter analyzed the 45th president ’ s second State of the Union Speech on Tuesday .
 In addressing Congress on Tuesday , Mr. Trump found himself in an identical position to his three immediate predecessor , Barack Obama , George W. Bush and Bill Clinton — facing a hostile Congress after a devastating midterm defeat .
 How each confronted the moment offer a window into their presidency ; together , they stand a a stark contrast to the current occupant of the Oval Office .
 In 1995 , Mr. Clinton responded to the Republican Revolution of the previous November by pivoting to the center and giving credence to the small-government agenda of Newt Gingrich and his fellow warrior . He admitted to misstep in his first two year in office , which had allowed his Republican opponent to caricature him a a tax-and-spend liberal .
 Mr. Clinton sketched a vision of a leaner , more efficient government , with fewer regulation and an overhauled welfare system . The conservative commentator William Kristol marveled that it wa the “ most conservative State of the Union by a Democratic president in history . ”
 Twelve year later , Mr. Bush opened his State of the Union address with a warm tribute to Ms. Pelosi , who assumed the speaker ’ s gavel for the first time after Democrats swept to power in the House in 2006 . He spoke of the pride her late father , Thomas D ’ Alesandro Jr. , a congressman from Maryland , would have felt in seeing his “ only daughter , Nancy , presiding tonight . ”
 It wa a grace note for Mr. Bush , who wa fighting to salvage his legacy after midterm election that served a a referendum on the Iraq war and his bungled handling of Hurricane Katrina . Mr. Trump , by contrast , appeared to rush his opening remark to deny Ms. Pelosi the chance to introduce him .
 Mr. Obama ’ s speech in 2011 came day after former Representative Gabrielle Giffords wa nearly killed in a mass shooting in Tucson — a tragedy that muted the normally partisan tone . Mr. Obama seized on the fleeting comity to declare , “ Each of u is part of something greater — something more consequential than party or political preference . ”
 Like Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton , he appealed to Republicans to find common ground — in his case behind a national project to make the United States more competitive in a rapidly changing global economy .
 “ This is our generation ’ s Sputnik moment , ” Mr. Obama said , urging Americans to “ out-innovate , out-educate and out-build the rest of the world . ”
 Mr. Trump referred to outspending and out-innovating major competitor , too , but he put it in the context of building nuclear weapon , after explaining why he pulled the United States out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty .
 For president , State of the Union speech rarely grease the wheel of bipartisanship . Mr. Clinton clashed repeatedly with Republicans after their congressional takeover , outmaneuvering Mr. Gingrich after he precipitated a government shutdown , though he made a historic deal on welfare overhaul that set the stage for his re-election in 1996 .
 Mr. Bush stuck to his troop surge in Iraq , reaping unexpected gain . But with the exception of a deal with the Democrats late in his term on the fiscal crisis , his legislative agenda wa over by the time he spoke in 2007 .
 Mr. Obama ’ s call for bipartisanship went nowhere in the Republican Senate , where the leader , Senator Mitch McConnell , vowed to make Mr. Obama a one-term president . He failed to strike a grand bargain on fiscal policy with Speaker John A. Boehner , with both side blaming the other for bad faith in the failed negotiation .
 For Mr. Trump , the portent for cooperation seem even le promising . He offered no tangible compromise on the border wall , he face a newly energized Democratic Party and he is heading into a presidential election year .
 “ We must choose between greatness and gridlock , result or resistance , vision or vengeance , incredible progress or pointless destruction , ” Mr. Trump said .
 The president implored his audience to choose “ greatness , ” but he gave them no road map for pursuing it .
 An earlier version of this article misstated the year President George Bush gave a State of the Union speech . It wa in 2007 , not 2011 , when he wa no longer in office .

 Our expert ha been closely following the race and the voter , all season . Here ’ s what he think will happen at the ceremony on Sunday .
 By Kyle Buchanan
 This crazy , mixed-up Oscar season come to a close with Sunday night ’ s ceremony , which will forgo a host and , after plenty of controversy , still present all 24 category on the air . But which movie is poised to win the biggest race of them all and take the Oscar for best picture ?
 Alfonso Cuarón ’ s black-and-white art film “ Roma ” is a critical favorite that took the top trophy from the Directors Guild of America , but a foreign-language film ha never won best picture , let alone one distributed by the insurgent streaming service Netflix . Many Oscar voter love the racial-issues dramedy “ Green Book , ” which wa given top honor by the oft-predictive Producers Guild of America , but the film couldn ’ t even nab a best-director nomination .
 [ Follow our live update and analysis from the Oscars ceremony , and see the best look from the red carpet . ]
 So though we ’ ve got two ostensible front-runner , this is still anybody ’ s game : After all , “ A Star Is Born ” once looked unbeatable , too , and now it ’ s limping to the finish line with a scant few trophy under it belt .
 [ Fill out your Oscar ballot . | Catch up on all the controversy and the Oscar-weekend party and event . ]
 ✓ “ Roma ” “ A Star Is Born ” “ BlacKkKlansman ” “ Black Panther ” “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” “ The Favourite ” “ Green Book ” “ Vice ”
 Of the other contender , a win for Spike Lee ’ s “ BlacKkKlansman ” or the Marvel phenomenon “ Black Panther ” would be historic . The royal comedy “ The Favourite ” rode across-the-board support to 10 nomination . The two music-driven drama , “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” and “ A Star Is Born , ” claim passionate fan and equally engaged detractor . And a vote for the Dick Cheney indictment “ Vice ” would at least send a political message .
 With all that in mind , I still think the industry prize given to “ Roma ” add up to a best-picture win that will prove to be a game-changing moment for Netflix . If a streamer can take the top Oscar , then all bet are off .
 ✓ Glenn Close “ The Wife ” Yalitza Aparicio “ Roma ” Olivia Colman “ The Favourite ” Lady Gaga “ A Star Is Born ” Melissa McCarthy “ Can You Ever Forgive Me ”
 A seven-time Oscar nominee , Glenn Close is poised to pick up her first statuette for her finely crafted work a a secretive spouse in “ The Wife. ” It ’ s been age since Close had a showcase role like this , and the 71-year-old actress galvanized voter further after a moving , personal Golden Globe acceptance speech in January . Her primary competition is a first-time nominee , Olivia Colman , who just won Bafta ’ s top prize for playing the queen in “ The Favourite ” and is fronting one of the night ’ s most nominated film .
 ✓ Rami Malek “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” Christian Bale “ Vice ” Bradley Cooper “ A Star Is Born ” Willem Dafoe “ At Eternity ’ s Gate ” Viggo Mortensen “ Green Book ”
 Oscar voter are sucker for a transformation , and this category offer two ostentatious example in Rami Malek , who played the Queen frontman Freddie Mercury with real swagger in “ Bohemian Rhapsody , ” and Christian Bale , who wa unrecognizable a Dick Cheney in “ Vice. ” Malek ha been one of this season ’ s most willing and able campaigner , and his film is a box-office sensation , so the 37-year-old actor is poised to become one of the youngest recipient of this award in recent memory .
 ✓ Regina King “ If Beale Street Could TalkAmy Adams “ Vice ” Emma Stone “ The Favourite ” Marina de Tavira “ Roma ” Rachel Weisz “ The Favourite ”
 This category promise to be one of the night ’ s most suspenseful race . The “ If Beale Street Could Talk ” star Regina King won the Golden Globe and Critics Choice Award , but she wa n't even nominated by the Screen Actors Guild or Bafta . The latter group gave it prize to Rachel Weisz , who hail from a best-picture nominee but may split vote with Emma Stone , her co-star from “ The Favourite. ” And then there ’ s the “ Vice ” nominee Amy Adams , whose Oscar win is long overdue . My guess is King will prevail : At the recent Oscar nominee ’ luncheon , she and Mahershala Ali were the two most-applauded contender .
 ✓Mahershala Ali “ Green Book ” Adam Driver “ BlacKkKlansman '' Sam Elliott “ A Star Is Born ” Richard E. Grant “ Can You Ever Forgive Me ? `` Sam Rockwell “ Vice ”
 Can Mahershala Ali become the second black actor after Denzel Washington to win more than one Oscar for acting ? All sign point to yes , a Ali ha swept the precursor this season for his work a the gifted pianist Don Shirley in “ Green Book. ” Only two thing are working against him : Ali won this same category two year ago for “ Moonlight , ” and voter may not be in such a hurry to reward him again so soon , while Richard E. Grant , the “ Can You Ever Forgive Me ? ” star , ha charmed his fair share of admirer on the award circuit and could prove to be a dark-horse winner .
 ✓ Alfonso Cuarón “ Roma '' Yorgos Lanthimos “ The Favourite ” Spike Lee `` BlacKkKlansman ” Adam McKay “ Vice ” Pawel Pawlikowski “ Cold War ”
 Though Barry Jenkins ( “ Moonlight ” ) and Steve McQueen ( “ 12 Years a Slave ” ) have seen their film win best picture , neither man won the best director Oscar . This present a clear path for Spike Lee to become the first black filmmaker to triumph in this category , except that he is up against Alfonso Cuarón , who ha taken every major directing prize this season . While the academy ha more of an imperative to reward Lee , who ha famously never won a competitive Oscar , Cuarón will be tough to topple .
 ✓ “ RBG ” “ Free Solo ” “ Hale County This Morning , This Evening ” “ Minding the Gap ” “ Of Fathers and Sons ”
 Last year ’ s biggest documentary , “ Wo n't You Be My Neighbor ? , ” wa also one of Oscar 's biggest snub . In it wake , two other breakout hit are best positioned to win this Oscar : the Ruth Bader Ginsburg documentary “ RBG , ” which also scored a nomination for original song , and the breathtaking rock-climber story “ Free Solo. ” The latter is more of a cinematic feat , but checking the box for “ RBG ” let voter throw their weight behind the indefatigable Supreme Court justice herself .
 ✓ “ The Favourite ” “ First Reformed '' “ Green Book ” “ Roma '' “ Vice ”
 “ Green Book ” won the Golden Globe , “ The Favourite ” scored with Bafta , and the Writers Guild gave it top prize in this category to Bo Burnham ’ s “ Eighth Grade , ” a film the Oscars didn ’ t even nominate . The race is likely to come down to “ Green Book ” and “ The Favourite , ” and the latter ’ s malicious wit give it the edge . Still , if “ Green Book ” pull off a win here early in the night , that could presage an eventual best-picture victory .
 ✓ “ BlacKkKlansman '' “ A Star Is Born ” “ The Ballad of Buster Scruggs ” “ Can You Ever Forgive Me ? ” “ If Beale Street Could Talk ”
 The screenplay Oscar often go to an auteur the academy is not quite hip enough to reward in the directing category , like Jordan Peele , Spike Jonze or Sofia Coppola . I wonder , then , if the adapted-screenplay race might be the safest place for voter to reward Spike Lee , one of four credited writer of “ BlacKkKlansman. ” Still , do n't count out Writers Guild winner “ Can You Ever Forgive Me ? , ” which ha it passionate fan and is , in it own larcenous way , about the very act of adaptation itself .
 ✓ “ Spider-Man : Into the Spider-Verse ” “ Incredibles 2 ” “ Isle of Dogs ” “ Mirai ” “ Ralph Breaks the internet ''
 Pixar ’ s superhero sequel “ Incredibles 2 ” is the highest-grossing animated film in history , and it director , Brad Bird , ha won this category twice , including for the first “ Incredibles. ” That 's formidable competition , and yet the contender with all the momentum is “ Spider-Man : Into the Spider-Verse , ” which came late in the year but ha picked up all the big animation prize . Even if “ Black Panther ” doesn ’ t take home best picture , expect at least one Marvel superhero to triumph on Oscar night .
 ✓ “ Roma ” Mexico “ Capernaum ” Lebanon “ Cold War ” Poland “ Never Look Away ” Germany “ Shoplifters ” Japan
 This is one of the strongest foreign-film lineup in recent memory , and in any other year , all of these movie would have the profile of a winner , including the Palme d ’ Or winner “ Shoplifters , ” Lebanon ’ s moving “ Capernaum , ” and “ Cold War ” and “ Never Look Away , ” which both scored cinematography nomination a well . ( “ Cold War ” even cracked the race for best director . ) Still , in a year when “ Roma ” could make history a the first foreign-language film to win best picture , it would seem outrageous for the movie to miss this prize on it path to victory .
 ✓ “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” “ BlacKkKlansman ” “ The Favourite ” “ Green Book ” “ Vice ”
 Action film have dominated this category for the last few year , but none were nominated this time . Of these five contender , “ Vice ” is the most aggressively edited by it very nature , because the director Adam McKay employ so much high-concept crosscutting . Many of my fellow pundit expect it to win , but I suspect “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” will pull out a shock victory , since many in the industry credit the editor John Ottman with salvaging the footage from a difficult shoot from which the original director , Bryan Singer , wa fired .
 ✓ “ Roma ” “ Cold War ” “ The Favourite ” “ Never Look Away ” “ A Star Is Born ”
 Initially , the academy had planned to give out this Oscar during a commercial break , and I suspect that ’ s because the front-runner is Cuarón , who is likely to dominate the telecast with multiple acceptance speech . Now that the academy ha bent to the industry backlash and reinstated this category in the regular part of the broadcast , you can expect Cuarón to make Oscar history a the first director to win the cinematography award for shooting his own film .
 ✓ “ The Favourite ” “ Black Panther ” “ First Man ”
 “ Mary Poppins Returns ”
 “ Roma ”
 Cinematography and production design ought to work in concert , and the eccentric lensing favored by the director of “ The Favourite , ” Yorgos Lanthimos , and his director of photography , Robbie Ryan , provides a great showcase for the film ’ s set , which take up much more of the fish-eye frame than they might on a conventionally shot movie . Voters also tend to prefer lavish period film here , which give “ The Favourite ” the edge over the futuristic “ Black Panther . ”
 ✓ “ First Man ” “ Avengers : Infinity War ” “ Christopher Robin ” “ Ready Player One ” “ Solo : A Star Wars Story ”
 The Visual Effects Society gave it main prize to “ Avengers : Infinity War , ” which juggled dozen of computer-aided hero and a motion-captured villain , but Oscar ha not rewarded a superhero film here since “ Spider-Man 2 ” came out 15 year ago . That favor “ First Man , ” which failed to make the best-picture cut but at least had the heft of a contender , unlike fellow nominee “ Ready Player One , ” “ Christopher Robin ” and “ Solo : A Star Wars Story . ”
 ✓ “ BlacKkKlansman ” “ Black Panther ” “ If Beale Street Could Talk ” “ Isle of Dogs ” “ Mary Poppins Returns ”
 For my money , none of last year ’ s score were a beautiful a the love-soaked swoon composed by Nicholas Britell for “ If Beale Street Could Talk. ” Then again , Jonny Greenwood ’ s “ Phantom Thread ” score wa the clear standout the year before , and it lost to “ The Shape of Water. ” This is all to say that though anything could happen in this category , the Oscar will probably go to the film with the most best-picture heat , winnowing the field to “ Black Panther ” and “ BlacKkKlansman. ” In a close race , I ’ m picking Terence Blanchard ’ s distinctive composition for “ BlacKkKlansman . ”
 ✓ “ Shallow ” “ A Star Is Born ”
 “ All the Stars ” “ Black Panther ”
 “ I ’ ll Fight ” “ RBG ''
 “ The Place Where Lost Things Go ” “ Mary Poppins Returns ”
 “ When a Cowboy Trades His Spurs for Wings ” “ The Ballad of Buster Scruggs ”
 I will let out a note a prolonged a Lady Gaga ’ s melismatic trailer howl if anything but “ Shallow ” win this Oscar . It is the centerpiece duet of “ A Star Is Born , ” the source material for one of last year ’ s most iconic movie scene and an irresistible earworm , so how could it not win ? Well , just to play devil ’ s advocate : If voter wanted to truly put an exclamation point on the award-season underperformance of “ A Star Is Born , ” they could deprive Bradley Cooper ’ s former front-runner of the only Oscar it is likely to take . But the academy wouldn ’ t stoop to such a troll move , would it ?
 ✓ “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” “ Black Panther ” “ First Man ” “ Roma ” “ A Star Is Born ”
 This Oscar tends to go to war film and movie musical , and in the absence of any soldier ’ story , we ’ ve got two song-laden contender in “ A Star Is Born ” and “ Bohemian Rhapsody. ” Cooper made the better film , but “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” ha all the momentum , and it end with a multisong concert that will clinch this win .
 ✓ “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” “ A Quiet Place ” “ Black Panther ” “ First Man ” “ Roma ”
 Sound editing is different from sound mixing in that it honor the creation of sound , rather than how they are woven together in an aural landscape . Few movie had a strong a focus on sound a the horror thriller “ A Quiet Place , ” while the creaky shuttle in “ First Man ” drove home just how perilous the mission to the moon really wa . Still , I think many Oscar voter won ’ t quite grok the difference between these sound category , and they ’ ll simply pick “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” for both .
 ✓ “ The Favourite ” “ The Ballad of Buster Scruggs ” “ Black Panther ” “ Mary Poppins Returns ” “ Mary Queen of Scots ”
 If you gave the vote to all the kid who dressed up on Halloween a Killmonger , T ’ Challa or the Dora Milaje , “ Black Panther ” would win in a walk . Alas , this Oscar almost always go to royal period piece , so I am predicting “ The Favourite ” will triumph in a close race . I ’ ve got nothing against those luscious costume , I just happen to believe that the long-overdue “ Black Panther ” designer , Ruth E. Carter , should win the Academy Award for Angela Bassett ’ s hat alone . I mean , did you see that ?
 ✓ “ Vice ” “ Border ” “ Mary Queen of Scots ”
 This Oscar almost always go to the team that worked on a best-picture contender or a performance that is likely to win an Oscar , which eliminates “ Mary Queen of Scots ” and the beguilingly offbeat “ Border. ” We ’ d at least have a more interesting race if “ Suspiria ” had been nominated for it transformation of Tilda Swinton into an elderly man , but given the field a it stand , “ Vice ” is the clear winner for encasing Christian Bale in Dick Cheney ’ s visage .
 ✓ “ Bao ” “ Animal Behaviour ” “ Late Afternoon ” “ One Small Step ” “ Weekends ”
 Though they are all animated in strikingly different way , several of this year ’ s short nominee have an undeniably Pixar feel to them , in that they telescope the span of an entire life into a single heart-tugging montage . Of them , the actual Pixar short ha the best chance at winning : Domee Shi ’ s “ Bao , ” which played before “ Incredibles 2 , ” is a clever film about a Chinese-Canadian woman who pours her love for her son into the food she make , with surprising result .
 ✓ “ Skin ”
 “ Detainment ”
 “ Fauve ”
 “ Marguerite ”
 “ Mother ”
 Mad respect to anyone who can make it through all five of these short , a beautifully shot but brutal lot in which nearly every story is about child in distress . Two nominee I think voter may respond to are “ Fauve , ” a harrowing story about two boy encountering quicksand , and “ Skin , ” a good-looking but incredibly obvious parable about race that star Hollywood actor like Danielle Macdonald and Jonathan Tucker . “ Marguerite ” is a wistful story about an elderly woman that will win point for harming no child , but I wonder if it may be too slight to win . “ Skin , ” for all it familiarity , probably ha the inside track .
 ✓ “ Period . End of Sentence . ”
 “ A Night at the Garden ”
 “ Black Sheep ”
 “ End Game ”
 “ Lifeboat ”
 This is the strongest of this year ’ s three short-film crop . Some voter may be drawn to “ A Night at the Garden , ” a documentary using footage of a 1939 Nazi rally at Madison Square Garden , since it recently made headline when Fox News refused to run an ad for it . Still , the two strongest entry are probably the one pushed by Netflix : “ Period . End of Sentence. , ” an empowering story of Indian woman manufacturing sanitary pad , and “ End Game , ” about an end-of-life care facility . The former , with it welcome moment of lightness and humor , may prove to be Oscar 's pick .

 NEW HAVEN — Nathan Chen ’ s morning had been hectic , but now he finally had a moment to relax . He flipped open his laptop and started scanning the headline of The Yale Daily News a his fellow classmate filled the 400-seat auditorium for an abnormal psychology lecture .
 Chen ’ s gaze settled on an article about a classmate , Sophie Ascheim , the executive producer of “ Period . End of Sentence , ” which three day earlier had won an Oscar in the documentary short category . Ascheim , a member of Chen ’ s residential college , wa already back on campus ; he had seen her that morning a they were rushing off to class .
 “ People do crazy impressive thing here , ” Chen said . “ Then they come back and they ’ re normal . ”
 Chen , 19 , is engaged in his own juggling act , balancing Ivy League course work and an elite figure skating career — two world spinning on his index finger . In January , Chen aced his first major skating test since entering college — he traveled to Detroit and captured his third consecutive national men ’ s single title . This week , while the Yale student body is on spring break , he will travel to Japan to defend his world title , putting to the test the theory that being well rounded and pursuing a life off the ice might ultimately make him better at skating .
 “ I can ’ t imagine training by myself day after day , ” Paul Wylie , a Harvard graduate who won a silver medal at the 1992 Olympics , said in a recent interview about Chen . Wylie marveled at Chen ’ s progress . “ His skating is better than ever . ”
 A bronze medalist in the team event last year in Pyeongchang , South Korea , Chen isn ’ t the first Olympian to be a full-time student and a fully engaged skater . In bygone era , when there were fewer competition and fame and fortune weren ’ t the main metric of success , Dick Button , Tenley Albright , Debi Thomas and Wylie all managed the duality of elite athletics and elite academic .
 More recently , Sarah Hughes enrolled at Yale after winning woman ’ s single at the 2002 Olympics , and took time off from school to take part in an ice tour .
 But a perhaps befits the man who last year became the first skater to land six jump of four revolution apiece in a competitive free program , Chen ha raised the degree of difficulty . He is approaching skating a if it were an independent study project , training by himself while checking in regularly with Rafael Arutyunyan , his longtime coach .
 Chen recognizes that for the next two year , skating judge will not be the only one carefully monitoring his every move . “ There ’ s a lot of people who said , ‘ There ’ s no way he ’ s going to be able to manage this , ’ ” he said . “ It is difficult , and I totally get that if I do poorly that might not be the greatest look . ”
 For Chen , the risk wa worth the reward of expanding his mind and his social circle . When he returned to campus after his victory at national , Chen ’ s suite mate greeted him with a box of doughnut to celebrate . He then gleaned a palatable life lesson : One doughnut won ’ t bring him down .
 He cherishes the friend he ha made and the deep conversation he ha had with fellow high achiever — but also those with student who have challenged his long-held assumption . Chen , whose childhood wa a carefully choreographed a one of his skating program , said , “ I ’ ve learned that there is literally no right or wrong answer to what to do with your life . ”
 And Chen ha found , in his study group , a collaborative closeness that is hard to cultivate in a sport a individualized , and insular , a skating , where , a he said , “ It ’ s not customary for other athlete to make sure you ’ re succeeding at the same rate . ”
 Chen zip around campus on a motorized skateboard , potentially sacrificing safety for sleep .
 “ I can get up at 9:15 and make it to my 9:30 class , ” he said .
 The abnormal psychology lecture , delivered by a guest speaker and centered on the biological component of psychiatric illness , wa Chen ’ s third class of the day , after calculus and statistic . He stacked his schedule in the morning so he could have his afternoon free to skate .
 After absorbing a 75-minute lecture on the role of brain chemistry in depressive disorder , during which he tapped note into his laptop , Chen returned to his residential college for a hot lunch . Over a plate of stew with carrot and a side of quinoa , Chen explained the appeal of college .
 It is a veritable smorgasbord compared with the strict fare of skating , where every day is spent around the same people with the same singular focus on performance .
 “ With the Olympic experience I had , it ha just given me a different perspective of skating , ” Chen said .
 A year ago , he entered the Pyeongchang men ’ s single competition a a gold medal contender . After a disastrous short program , he sat in 17th place , then vaulted into fifth on the strength of his go-for-broke , quad-fueled free skate .
 Now he think about his once all-consuming pursuit in a different way .
 “ Even if you win a gold medal , you have that moment of glory , but after that what happens ? ” Chen said . “ There ’ s so many moment that will happen after that that are more important . ”
 Chen , who started high school in regular class but reluctantly finished with online study to accommodate the availability of ice time , accepted admission to Yale because he felt it afforded him the best of both world . He is interested in studying medicine , though he is keeping his option open . A college degree is de rigueur in his family ; Chen 's mother is a medical translator and his father is a scientist , and he ha four older sibling who are employed in the tech , aerospace and finance industry .
 Yale official accommodated his training need by offering an afternoon window of ice time at Ingalls Rink , the on-campus home of the men ’ s and woman ’ s hockey team . He also ha the use of the weight room used by the athletic team , where he follows a program implemented by a United States Olympic Committee strength and conditioning trainer .
 If his study provide him with an escape from skating , his skating provides him with a needed escape from his study .
 “ I go on the ice and I can distract myself from school , ” he said . “ And it give me a dopamine kick . ”
 For most of his post-lunch , hourlong practice at Ingalls , Chen had the facility to himself , except for a woman ’ s hockey player who ran up and down the arena step . He skated over to the board at regular interval to manage the music on his phone . Upon finishing , he grabbed a bucket of ice shaving and repaired the divot in the ice that he had created with his toe pick when he pushed off for his jump .
 The serenity of the setting suit Chen , who said these solo session have allowed him to renew his relationship with the ice and deepen his connection to his music .
 “ I kind of feel like when no one ’ s watching I feel the most attuned to my skating , ” he said .
 When Chen finished skating at Ingalls , he changed quickly and hopped into his sport utility vehicle for the 30-minute commute to Champions Skating Center in Cromwell , Conn. , for additional practice .
 He couldn ’ t dawdle ; he had to get his work done and return to campus in time for his 8 p.m. music class . For the next hour , Chen reeled off quad while maneuvering around more than a dozen skater , including a little girl in hot pink skate and a youngster who wa practicing her forward to backward transition . He wa struggling with one of his jump , so he had one of the coach at the facility take video , which Chen planned to forward to Arutyunyan to critique .
 Arutyunyan said the arrangement worked because he coached Chen not to need him . In an email , he wrote , “ I always prepare the athlete so they can cope with any problem that may occur in their career , figuratively speaking like a good parent who brings up his child with the understanding that one day he will have to solve all problem on his own . ”
 In a subsequent telephone interview , Arutyunyan suggested that those who wonder if Chen can straddle the hypercompetitive world of sport and the hypercompetitive world of an Ivy League college are missing the point .
 “ I know Olympic champion whose gold medal didn ’ t help their life , ” said Arutyunyan , which is why , in his mind , there ’ s only one question worth asking : How can Chen not try ?

 Essay
 By Meg Wolitzer
 I ’ m not sure how it is for most novelist , but when I create character , their face always look a little blurry to me . Though I come to know who these people are in the important way — their general physical self and how it feel to be around them ; how their presence in a scene change the emotional room temperature ; who or what they love or desire — still their facial feature remain indistinct , a in a dream . This blurriness is never a real problem . It ’ s not like being unable to , say , find a friend at a crowded restaurant or pick out your own child across a playground .
 While I always try to burrow into my perception in order to create character , I am stopped short of actually visualizing them with police-artist precision . For me , facial blurriness come with the territory , and I ’ ve grown accustomed to it over the year I ’ ve been writing fiction .
 Twice I ’ ve had the good fortune to have my character take on a big-screen physical specificity . My 1988 novel “ This Is Your Life ” wa adapted for a feature film ; it became “ This Is My Life , ” the first film Nora Ephron directed , co-written by Nora and Delia Ephron , and starring Julie Kavner a a stand-up comedian . Now , my 2003 novel “ The Wife ” is a film for which Glenn Close , playing the title character , won a Golden Globe and a SAG award and wa nominated for a Bafta and an Academy Award . All of this is heady , effervescent stuff for a novelist .
 [ Read our book review of “ The Wife . ” ]
 I attended the premiere of “ The Wife ” at the Toronto Film Festival , sitting in a cluster that included Close , and during the standing ovation at the end of the film , I felt a particular kind of excitement . It wasn ’ t just the generic Hollywood feeling to which many of u are susceptible . The face for which I had created the outline had been filled in , saturated with new meaning .
 The book ( and the film ) is about the long marriage between Joan and Joseph Castleman . He is a much-celebrated American novelist who , in the film , win the Nobel Prize in Literature ; in the book it is a made-up award called the Helsinki Prize , which I describe a slightly le grand than the Nobel but still hugely important . ( My older son is convinced that part of the reason I write novel is so I can make up the name of thing like prize , rock band , television show and breakfast cereal . ) Together they travel to Europe for the ceremony . In both book and film , Joe Castleman is an unreconstructed narcissist who belief his own publicity .
 The novel is told from Joan ’ s point of view , and I worked to give her a voice of controlled rage and pissed-off humor . Near the beginning , she describes her husband a “ one of those men who own the world . You know the type I mean : those advertisement for themselves , those sleepwalking giant , roaming the earth and knocking over other men , woman , furniture , village . … There are many variety of this kind of man : Joe wa the writer version , a short , wound-up , slack-bellied novelist who almost never slept , who loved to consume runny cheese and whiskey and wine , all of which he used a a vessel to carry the pill that kept his blood lipid from congealing like yesterday ’ s pan dripping … who had no idea of how to take care of himself or anyone else , and who derived much of his style from ‘ The Dylan Thomas Handbook of Personal Hygiene and Etiquette . ’ ”
 The film ha no voice-over to stand in for a first-person narrative . Instead of hearing a stream of piquant and sometimes skewering reflection on what it ’ s like to be the invisible wife of a supposed Great Man , we are given something different , and equally powerful : Glenn Close ’ s face . Audiences are treated to the many , many shade of feeling that Close express , sometimes through the barest eye movement or slight lift or droop of a lip . How doe she do it ? I kept wondering , just a people marvel at how fiction writer give character that authentic human sense , somehow managing to whoosh life into them .
 As a teenager I spent a summer at a performing art workshop in the Berkshires , which later became the jumping-off place for my novel “ The Interestings. ” When I acted in play there — whether by Lorca or Thornton Wilder — I spoke my line in what I can only call my Katharine Hepburn voice , inappropriate though it wa . Soon enough , I realized it wa much easier for me to locate “ voice ” when writing fiction than when performing the part of the old woman in “ The House of Bernarda Alba ” or playing Hollow Man No . 3 in a staged mash-up of T. S. Eliot poem . Because “ The Wife ” is so voice-fueled , I would never have imagined that the film version would come to depend so much on the face . It ’ s hard to look away when Close is onscreen .
 She ha a wonderful co-star in Jonathan Pryce , who play Joe , but the pull of the movie , the true imperative , is with Joan , a the title tell u it should be . Joan is an older woman who ha lived in the shadow of the male “ genius ” over all the year of their long marriage . The Swedish director Bjorn Runge let the camera linger not on Joe , where it ha stayed for most of their life together , but on Joan . While my novel is about what Joan tell u , the film , a people have noted , is really about what she doesn ’ t tell u — at least not for a while . Her face can be cryptic , intriguing , unsettling . As I watched “ The Wife ” in that concert hall in Toronto , I felt myself tensely sitting there waiting for the torrent , the spew , the thing that the wife ha been keeping inside that head , behind that face .
 I ’ ve always felt that novel are like Advent calendar ; the novelist get to decide which particular door is the best one through which to enter . In writing “ The Wife , ” I knew from the start that I wanted to tell the story of the spouse of an emotionally bloated male novelist , through his wife ’ s experience . So I let her rip .
 In the screenplay ( adapted by the screenwriter and playwright Jane Anderson , who won an Emmy for her TV version of Elizabeth Strout ’ s “ Olive Kitteridge ” ) , not only ha the Helsinki Prize been notched up to the Nobel , but also , Joan ’ s verdict on her marriage come far later . That make for a different kind of drama . In the book she tell the reader from the start where thing stand between Joe and her , and then she get a chance to describe what it ’ s been like for her over the year . The great difference between my book and the film is that in the book , Joan Castleman tell her own story . The “ I ” voice allows her to do that . In the movie , Joan ’ s face doe the work .
 [ Read a chapter from “ The Wife . ” ]
 The first time I saw “ The Wife ” — it hadn ’ t been released yet — I ’ d been sent a link and a passcode , and wanted to see it by myself . I had no idea how I would feel . As soon a I saw the face of this actress , I felt a if I were watching a home movie I hadn ’ t known existed . There wa Glenn Close , she of “ Fatal Attraction ” and “ Damages ” and “ Dangerous Liaisons ” and “ The Big Chill ” ; she of “ The World According to Garp. ” But now she wa Joan of “ The Wife. ” She wa my Joan . We were connected through the strange alchemy that is the transformation of book to film .
 What is it that happens to you , the writer , when the blurry face you ’ ve lived with for year is sharpened into specificity ? And when the person playing your character ha a face so familiar to you that you won ’ t ever be able to think of your character again in a more impressionistic form ? What happened to me is a simple and a complicated a this : One of my character will always be someone I know a my own invention , and now , in addition , she will always have the face of Glenn Close , the person who became Joan Castleman .

 COPENHAGEN — The squat and leg lift were harder than they looked , and after a few set , Alfonso Aguirre Rodriguez placed his hand on his knee and attempted to compose himself .
 In November , Aguirre , a 24-year-old professional video game player from Spain , joined the five-man roster of Origen , a League of Legends team that competes in the game ’ s top European league . The player — all signed in late fall — were told at the time that the team might be run a bit differently from what they were accustomed to . Now here they were , five young men who make their living sitting almost completely still in front of desktop computer , sweating through an hourlong workout in a cramped gym .
 “ I think I ’ m going to puke my oatmeal , ” said Aguirre , who is known in the gaming community a Mithy . “ I ’ m dying . ”
 Some year ago , traditional sport league were revolutionized by young analyst wielding computer . The way thing had always been done , it turned out , wa not always the best way to do thing . Now echo of that transformation have arrived in the growing world of professional e-sports , where gamers are being shepherded toward a new frontier , oddly , by the old , corporeal wisdom of traditional sport .
 The debate about whether competitive gamers can be considered athlete may never end . In the meantime , though , gamers are increasingly acting like them .
 Origen is one of two team owned by Rfrsh Entertainment , an e-sports company based in Copenhagen . Two year ago , the organization hired Kasper Hvidt , a former captain of Denmark ’ s national handball team , to be it sporting director . Hvidt , 43 , had no previous exposure to gaming . But that wa the point .
 E-sports in recent year have crept into the mainstream , attracting new fan , new sponsor and new investment . The top professional now make six-figure salary and earn even more with endorsement and prize money . And yet , Hvidt observed , their approach to performance remained amateurish .
 Eating right , sleeping right , exercising , cleaning up for sponsor — these idea have undergirded traditional sport for generation . In e-sports , they are regarded a almost radical .
 “ They don ’ t look at themselves a physical human being , ” said Hvidt , who won the European handball championship with Denmark in 2008 .
 “ It ’ s common sense , in a way . But with them it wa not . ”
 Rfrsh ha a validating narrative under it belt . The company ’ s other team , Astralis , which competes internationally in the first-person shooter game Counter-Strike : Global Offensive , had gone almost a year without winning a tournament when Hvidt joined the organization in mid-2017 . In 2018 , the team earned $ 3.7 million in prize money while putting together one of the most dominant year ever by any team in any e-sports game .
 And so Origen this year ha set off on the same journey of athletic self-improvement . As recently a last year , the player ’ typical day might have been a sedentary extravaganza of sugary energy drink , fast food and unresolved psychic tension . Now , their day are interposed with protein smoothy , yoga mat and slow-paced breathing exercise .
 The effect of those change , the team said , have been plain to see : After starting the current season with a 1-4 record , Origen went on a tear , winning 11 of it final 13 match , finishing the regular season in second place and securing a first-round bye for the playoff , which began Friday .
 “ These are little thing , ” Fabian Broich , Origen ’ s assistant coach , said . “ But they add up , and over the long term you have a more emotionally stable team and a more focused team . ”
 At Rfrsh , Hvidt ha assembled a performance team — a physical trainer , a sport psychologist , a massage therapist , a medical doctor and a nutritionist — and constructed a lifestyle plan for the player that combine scientific research , old-school sport wisdom and simple common sense . Broich , 28 , a former professional soccer player from Germany , act a a liaison between the management team and the player , implementing the principle on the ground .
 The player , who hail from five European country and range in age from 18 to 24 , live in Denmark and fly each weekend to Berlin , where the League of Legends match are taped in front of a boisterous studio audience . In Copenhagen , they are required to get around by bicycle ( a rule they all hated at first ) and have fitness and yoga class during the week . On Mondays , they meet with the team psychologist for an “ empty-the-backpack ” session .
 Every morning , the team meet for breakfast in Broich ’ s apartment , a ritual designed in part to get the gamers — night owl and notoriously late riser — out of bed at a reasonable hour . Their other meal are catered with guidance from the nutritionist .
 “ Before , I would go to sleep at 5 a.m. and wake up at 2 p.m. the next day , eat McDonald ’ s two time , and that ’ d be it , ” Patrik Jiru , 18 , an Origen player from the Czech Republic , said a he ate a salmon and vegetable omelet one recent morning .
 After breakfast , the player biked to the gym for a core workout and a physical therapy session .
 “ Last time we did this , my body wa sore for three day , ” Jonas Andersen , 24 , an Origen player from Denmark known a Kold , said a he grabbed a medicine ball .
 Mikkel Hjuler , a trainer who work with Danish Olympians , guided the team through some gaming-specific exercise . He had the player wrap their fist inside elastic band and flex their finger . He taught them a neck exercise favored by boxer .
 The player were willing participant , but they admitted that their ambition , from a physical standpoint , were modest .
 “ I ’ m O.K . with being chubby a long a I don ’ t pas out when I ’ m running — which , right now , I might , ” Aguirre said .
 The player continue to train several hour a day in front of computer , but even those session now borrow element from traditional sport .
 Before a recent scrimmage session at the Rfrsh headquarters , Broich distributed magnesium pill and protein bar . ( He keep vitamin D and krill oil in his arsenal , too . ) Later , he blended a potpourri of nutritional supplement — moringa , matcha , maca , chlorella , açaí and a half-dozen others — into a thick protein shake .
 In their meeting room , a quotation attributed to the N.B.A . coach Phil Jackson — “ The strength of the team is each individual member ” — wa scribbled on a dry-erase board . After one practice game , the team laid out yoga mat and stretched on foam roller .
 Trevor Henry , 31 , a broadcast commentator for Riot Games , the company behind League of Legends , marveled at how quickly the game ’ s competitive landscape wa professionalizing . He wa happy , for instance , that some team were reconsidering their use of gaming house , a classic e-sports setup in which player live and train together under one roof .
 “ Go back just a few year : Professional player would play 10 to 11 hour every day and do takeout food every day , ” Henry said . “ Pizza box would stack up room . Laundry would never get done . I ’ ll be brutally honest : Teams didn ’ t wash the team shirt . They ’ d have the same team shirt that they ’ d wear 24 week in a year that ha never seen detergent . ”
 This lifestyle — part monk , part fraternity brother — wa not only accepted but also held up a the very reason the player were successful . But that wisdom is now being challenged , and in Europe the shift by League of Legends this year to a 10-team , franchise model ( akin to American sport league ) ha encouraged organization to make more long-term investment .
 Last year , Fabien Devide , the chairman of Team Vitality , a French gaming organization , spent seven month embedded in his League of Legends team ’ s gaming house in Berlin . He wa startled by what he saw .
 “ It wa a madhouse , ” Devide said , describing an atmosphere with an utter lack of boundary between personal and professional life . “ It can become a toxic environment very quick . ”
 Devide said Team Vitality planned to move it player into separate apartment later this year . Acknowledging the pioneering example of Rfrsh , he said he wa formalizing plan to open a training center for his organization in Paris and hire a performance director , in the mold of Hvidt , to devise a program grounded in traditional sport idea .
 Teams now understand that championship are won and lost in the detail . When Origen wa assembling it squad last year , Hvidt asked potential signees to complete a personality test with hundred of question to make sure it wa building an emotionally compatible group .
 In December , the player convened for a preseason camp with one catch : no computer . Instead , the player spent several day completing trust exercise and discussing their dream with Lars Robl , a sport psychologist who spent two decade in the Danish special force — “ the real Counter Strike , ” he joked — and whose other client include the Danish soccer club F.C . Midtjylland .
 Robl ’ s job now is to help the gamers see themselves a elite athlete , just like the soccer player .
 “ They have the same DNA , ” Robl said . “ They ’ re just not aware of it yet . ”

 Finding out you have a chronic illness — one that will , by definition , never go away — change thing , both for you and those you love .
 By Tessa Miller
 Seven Thanksgivings ago , I got sick and I never got better .
 What I thought wa food poisoning turned out to be Crohn ’ s disease , a form of inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) that doesn ’ t have a cure . It fool my immune system into attacking my digestive system , resulting in what I can only describe a the attempted birth of my intestine through my butthole . It ’ s a cruel and often debilitating disease .
 Since that first hospital stay , I ’ ve had colonoscopy , biopsy , CT scan , X-rays , blood and stool test , enema , suppository , rectal foam , antiemetic , antidiarrheal , antiviral , antibiotic , anti-inflammatory , opiate , steroid , immunoglobulin , biologics and three fecal transplant ( if you want to hear a story about my 9-year-old poop donor and a blender , find me on Twitter ) .
 My disease is managed now thanks to an expensive drug called infliximab , but the future is unpredictable . IBD work in pattern of flare and remission , and little is known about what cause either .
 When I wa diagnosed , I didn ’ t know how much my life would change . There ’ s no conversation about that foggy space between the common cold and terminal cancer , where illness won ’ t go away but won ’ t kill you , so none of u know what “ chronic illness ” mean until we ’ re thrown into being sick forever .
 “ When an illness that the doctor can ’ t cure becomes part of our life , all the rule seem to change , ” said Paul K. Chafetz , Ph.D. , a psychologist in Dallas . “ It ’ s scary in a dozen ways. ” I ’ ve learned countless lesson since the early day of my illness , but here are five I wish I ’ d known from the start .
 Chronic illness patient not only face painful physical symptom , but also mental one that linger even when the disease is well controlled . “ There is trauma related to certain aspect of illness or treatment , and fear of outcome like death or disability , ” said Matt Lundquist , LCSW , a psychotherapist in New York . “ For many people , there are financial uncertainty of paying for medical care. ” Plus , there ’ s anxiety over loss of autonomy and control , he said .
 Chronic illness also increase the risk of depression , Mr. Chafetz said , citing a 2007 World Health Organization survey that found a higher likelihood of depressive episode among those with chronic health condition than without .
 A therapist should be considered a crucial part of your care team , just a important a a gastroenterologist or cardiologist . “ A provider who ha experience working with chronic illness is key , ” Mr. Lundquist said . “ It ’ s a population whose mental health struggle can be misunderstood. ” If you ’ re homebound , some mental health professional will do home visit , Skype or phone appointment , or you can connect with one through apps like TalkSpace and BetterHelp .

 It ’ s hard to be a good employee when you need extended time off . It ’ s hard to be a good friend when you cancel plan last minute . It ’ s hard to be a good partner or parent when you barely have the energy to get out of bed . No matter how much you try to explain , people expect you to get better already — and when you don ’ t , they resent you , consciously or not . Some relationship end entirely , casualty of an unfair and misunderstood illness , while others get stronger a you find your true support system .
 But most of all , your relationship with yourself change . You grieve a version of yourself that doesn ’ t exist anymore , and a future version that look different than you ’ d planned .
 You might have to give up career goal , hobby and family plan , learning a “ new normal ” in their place . “ In trauma therapy we call this ‘ integration , ’ the task of integrating a new reality into one ’ s life and worldview , ” Mr. Lundquist said . “ This emotional work can look a lot like grief therapy for a passing loved one. ” Try to be patient a you get to know the new version of yourself .
 “ Having a chronic illness is a series of continuous ups and down where some thing that work for a while won ’ t and so on , ” said Alicia Aiello , president of Girls With Guts , an organization that empowers woman with IBD and ostomy . “ Be open to this change . ”
 People are compelled to offer advice about chronically ill body because they ’ re convinced a fix must exist . Here are a few of the thing I ’ ve been told , unsolicited , to try over the year : yoga , meditation , essential oil , acupuncture , CBD oil , vaping , prayer , bone broth and [ fill in the blank with the latest fad ] diet . Some of these are great in conjunction with medical treatment — my doctor recommends meditation for stress relief , for example — but the advice is offered a a cure or a better alternative to whatever I ’ m already doing . And let ’ s face it , no amount of broth is going to turn off my spazzy immune system .
 Chronically ill people research their disease ad nauseam . They try more treatment than they can count . In many case , great scientific mind can ’ t crack a cause or cure . So unless someone asks for your advice , don ’ t offer it . If you ’ re on the receiving end of misguided advice , say something like , “ I appreciate that you ’ re trying to help , but my doctor and I think this treatment is best right now ” or “ There ’ s no known cure for my disease , but I ’ d love if you donated toward the research to find one ! ” You can also educate them by saying , “ Thank you , but that wouldn ’ t help . Here ’ s how my disease work , and here ’ s the kind of treatment that ’ s required . ”
 Maybe it ’ s because I ’ m a journalist , but when I wa diagnosed , I dove into research . Learning a much a I could helped me feel a sense of control , so I bought every available IBD book and spent hour reading study and forum online . I made list of question for my doctor and insisted they give me their personal phone number . I expected my friend and family to be a gung-ho a I wa , but turn out , most of them never even Googled my disease . It wa up to me to learn and teach — friend , family , boss , partner — through conversation , book with passage marked , email highlighting new research , and social medium post .
 There ’ s a sense of shame that come with chronic illness that pressure patient into secrecy , making them feel like they can ’ t discus their disease outside of the doctor ’ s office . Secrecy bolster the lack of public conversation and knowledge , which feed the shame patient feel . “ Let others know what ’ s going on , ” Ms. Aiello said . “ People with chronic illness withhold information to protect themselves or others , but this can be more hurtful . ”
 Chronic illness is really lonely .
 Loved one try their best , but your fellow “ spoonies , ” a they ’ re affectionately called , intimately know the challenge of forever sickness . Six in 10 Americans live with at least one chronic condition , and thanks to the internet , it ’ s easier than ever to connect with them in support group and chronic illness community .
 It took me three year to join an online IBD community . I pridefully thought I could go it alone , but that wa like being lost at sea and ignoring a rescue ship . Now , I tell all newly diagnosed folk to join a support group right away — it doesn ’ t just help you feel le alone , but it connects you with resource and provides a place to ask question and share story without shame . The Crohn ’ s and Colitis Foundation ha resource to help you find one . For a sometimes embarrassing “ bathroom disease ” like IBD , this is especially vital .
 Living with chronic illness make every day a little harder , but it also make every day a little sweeter . Though I don ’ t know what my future hold , I ’ m overwhelmed with a gratitude I didn ’ t have before my diagnosis — some day I marvel at just being alive .
 “ The challenge is steep , ” Mr. Chafetz said , “ but the patient ’ s mission is to grow into this challenge , create meaning , and be the best person they can be . ”

 Editors ’ Choice
 Halfway through Black History Month , and who know how long into the latest news cycle involving politician and their explosive past , might we recommend a couple of appropriate book ? One offer historical context : Richard Gergel ’ s “ Unexampled Courage ” tell the true story of a black World War II veteran who wa blinded at the hand of a Southern sheriff , and examines how his case spurred a white judge to champion the civil right movement in it early day . The other offer Afrocentric escapism and fantasy : Marlon James ’ s best-selling new novel , “ Black Leopard , Red Wolf , ” draw on ancient myth and recent pop culture a it launch an epic tale about the fight for a lost kingdom . Either of those would be good reading for the rest of the month , or beyond .
 We also have a memoir about the hard work of cleaning other people ’ s house , a look at the AIDS crisis in India , a rigorous history of the Chernobyl nuclear meltdown , and the posthumous memoir of a young mother chronicling her fight against cancer . If all of that sound a little heavy — a person can take only so much gloom at once , after all , even a person who belief in facing the world head-on — then you might be inspired by Seth Fletcher ’ s account of the scientist who are working to photograph a black hole , or transported by Janet Malcolm ’ s characteristically crisp and wide-ranging cultural essay , or diverted by Karen Thompson Walker ’ s novel about an epidemic of sleep that descends on a California town . Read that one in bed , and we ’ ll see you next week .

 BLACK LEOPARD , RED WOLF , by Marlon James .

 2019 M.L.B . Season Preview
 With better development and technology at every level of the game , team can draw from a player pool that is bigger — and cheaper — than ever .

 BRADENTON , Fla. — The first player drafted this decade wa Bryce Harper , who is now starting a 13-year , $ 330 million contract with the Philadelphia Phillies . The third player drafted wa Manny Machado , who is now starting a 10-year , $ 300 million contract with the San Diego Padres .
 Tucked within that $ 630 million sandwich , with the second overall pick in 2010 , wa Jameson Taillon , a starter for the Pittsburgh Pirates whose career ha been sidetracked by a torn elbow ligament , a sport hernia and testicular cancer .
 “ I always made sure when I wa hurt that my investment were going well and they were in a good place , ” Taillon , 27 , said , smiling last month at the Pirates ’ training complex here . “ You can still believe in yourself , but when an injury happens , there ’ s not much you can do . You never know what ’ s on the horizon . ”
 When Taillon wa drafted , he could not have known the landscape that would greet him in his first full , healthy season in the major , which came last year . In 2010 , according to Fangraphs , there were 22 pitcher who worked at least 50 inning and averaged 95.2 mile per hour on their fastball . Last season , according to Fangraphs , there were 67 , including Taillon .
 [ A.L . Preview : How Hard Will It Be for the Red Sox to Repeat ? Ask the Astros ]
 The supply of prospect with big-league stuff — and the savvy to go with it — ha skyrocketed . This is part of the reason that Major League Baseball ’ s player population ha continued to balloon : According to the Elias Sports Bureau , a record 1,379 player appeared in a major league game last season , the sixth year in a row with an increase .
 In 2010 , Elias said , there were 1,249 overall player — meaning that team have added the equivalent of five 25-man roster , and then some , to the playing rank since this decade began .
 “ I threw 95 and I wa one of the hardest thrower in all of minor-league baseball , ” Taillon said . “ Now , you see guy across every level that throw hard . And a lot ’ s written about young guy throwing weighted ball and only focusing on throwing hard , but some of these guy are polished . They ’ re throwing three or four pitch for strike at 22 , 23 year old .
 “ We ’ re investing so much money in player development , you ’ re seeing kid coming to big-league camp that aren ’ t intimidated . ”
 Standout player like Taillon — who posted a 3.20 earned run average in 32 start last season — can marvel at the trend while still expecting to someday sign a lucrative contract . But while Harper and Machado scored big in free agency , many more veteran will open this season with much lower salary than player of their caliber once commanded .
 That ha contributed to a growing sense among player that a system that once reliably rewarded their year of toil no longer work for them . The flurry of contract extension late in spring training only underscored the point : Take what ’ s in front of you , because the open market can be a cold , lonely place .
 “ If you look at the guy that are having to sign these nonroster deal , or guy that still don ’ t have job , far and away most of them comprise that middle class of baseball player , ” said Sean Doolittle , the All-Star closer for the Washington Nationals .
 “ They ’ re not the young guy anymore , and they ’ re not the superstar . They ’ re very serviceable big leaguers , they ’ re past arbitration , they ’ re veteran , and the market for those guy is evaporating . Teams are no longer looking at that eight-year veteran who they might have to spend several million on a someone that can help their team . They ’ ll take the cheaper labor — the guy that ha option , give them roster flexibility , and cost a lot le . ”
 [ N.L . Preview : A Deep Talent Pool Should Keep the Dodgers Afloat ]
 Players need six year of major league service to become free agent , and between two and three year to be eligible for salary arbitration . It could be that the sophistication of player development — in the United States amateur rank , the international market and major league farm system — is producing a deeper pool of acceptable choice for major league roster .
 “ When I first started scouting in 2007 , veteran scout would still talk about high school kid getting homesick , guy that had never left their hometown , and that ’ s just not the case anymore , ” said Mike Elias , the Baltimore Orioles ’ general manager . “ These guy , when they enter professional baseball , they ’ ve already hit with wood , they ’ ve been on the travel circuit , they know each other from the summer . They ’ re ready . ”
 The rise in overall player can be traced almost entirely to pitcher . Last season included only six more position player than in 2010 , but 124 more pitcher — up to a record 751 . Starters work fewer inning , in part , because team have better option to replace them a they get deep into game .
 Many of those option can be shuttled back and forth between the major and the minor while making close to the minimum salary of $ 555,000 . They may also offer a higher ceiling of production — though a lower floor — than a midlevel veteran who cost much more and can not be sent to the minor . For many team , the choice is easy .
 “ One of the thing team have realized is the value in giving that opportunity to a player that you ’ ve signed , scouted and developed relative to the potential marginal upgrade in someone that ha four or five year of major league service , ” said Ross Atkins , the Toronto Blue Jays ’ general manager . “ Determining where that difference is , in a more thorough way , is occurring because of manpower , really . ”
 That realization ha transformed franchise . Since Atkins and team president Mark Shapiro took over the Blue Jays ’ baseball operation in late 2015 , Toronto ha added significantly to it front office in an effort to better cultivate it own talent . The Blue Jays have added at least six position for research and development in addition to creating a high-performance department that emphasizes strength and conditioning , mental health and nutrition throughout their farm system .
 Long gone are the day when minor leaguers subsisted on peanut butter and jelly sandwich with threadbare coaching staff to guide them . Teams employ more coach than ever in the minor and the major , and arm them with increasingly sophisticated tool to develop player .
 Jeff Luhnow , the general manager of the Houston Astros , noted that the first aim of the analytics revolution — think of the “ Moneyball ” -era Oakland Athletics , in the early 2000s — wa using statistic to better predict future performance . Now , he said , team emphasize technology to better identify tool in amateur and attack the deficiency of their own prospect .
 “ There ’ s much more actionable feedback today than there ever ha been , so you don ’ t let a player go down a path for very long if it ’ s not a path that ’ s going to work for him , long term , in the big league , ” Luhnow said .
 He mentioned three company many team now use — Rapsodo , TrackMan and Blast Motion — that give coach instant feedback on player ’ movement . Objective , easy-to-visualize data appeal to player from a tech-savvy generation .
 “ Before , you relied on the scout or the coach to say , ‘ Well , you need to make this adjustment , and just trust me on it because I ’ ve seen it before , and what you ’ re doing is not going to work at the next level , so you need to change something , ’ ” Luhnow said . “ Now , you can actually show them video , show their number , and say , ‘ This is what you ’ re doing , and I ’ ll show you why that doesn ’ t work at the next level and show you what doe work , and let ’ s work on changing you , or modifying what you ’ re doing . ’
 “ That , by definition , will lead to a higher success rate in development . Let ’ s say 5 percent of player get developed into big leaguers and it go up to 7 percent . That ’ s a massive difference , because we haven ’ t increased our capacity , but what we ’ ve done is increase our throughput . So the success rate is good for player , but it probably result in an abundance of an oversupply . Obviously , it doesn ’ t affect a Harper or Machado , but there are just more option . ”
 Other team have noticed the Astros ’ success . Two of Luhnow ’ s assistant have become general manager elsewhere — Baltimore ’ s Elias and the Milwaukee Brewers ’ David Stearns — and several former Astros coach have received promotion with other team , including Alex Cora , who managed the Boston Red Sox to the World Series title last fall .
 The same thing ha happened to the Los Angeles Dodgers , who have won two National League pennant in a row with a knack for progressive method . Their president of baseball operation , Andrew Friedman , said he got 39 request last fall from other team wanting to interview Dodgers personnel .
 “ The past two off-season , I ’ ve spent the first four to six week like an H.R . director , ” Friedman said .
 When the Dodgers lost their hitting coach , Turner Ward , to the Cincinnati Reds , they replaced him with Robert Van Scoyoc , 32 , a private hitting instructor who never played professionally but who ha helped otherwise ordinary hitter , like J.D . Martinez and Chris Taylor , develop into star . Unlocking hitting secret , Friedman said , remains a largely untapped field .
 “ Since I ’ ve been sitting in advance meeting and been closer to that prep , nothing ha changed on the offensive side in 12 , 13 year , ” he said , “ whereas on the run-prevention side , everything ha changed . ”
 While run per game have fluctuated in this decade , strikeout — the ultimate way to fool or overpower a hitter — have increased every season since 2006 . This month , the league and the union finally gave into the trend and legislated a change .
 With no end in sight to the procession of polished , power arm , they agreed to expand the size of the active roster next season to 26 — virtually assuring that the record of 1,379 player in a season will not last long .

 Artificial intelligence ha bested top player in chess , Go and even StarCraft . But can it fly a drone faster than a pro racer ? More than $ 1 million is on the line to find out .
 By Jake Swearingen
 A drone from the University of Zurich is an engineering and technical marvel . It also move slower than someone taking a Sunday morning jog .
 At the International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems in Madrid last October , the autonomous drone , which navigates using artificial intelligence , raced through a complicated series of turn and gate , buzzing and moving like a determined and oversized bumblebee . It bobbed to duck under a bar that swooshed like a clock hand , yawed left , pitched forward and raced toward the finish line . The drone , small and covered in sensor , demolished the competition , blazing through the course twice a fast a it nearest competitor . Its top speed : 5.6 mile per hour .
 A few week earlier , in Jeddah , Saudi Arabia , a different drone , flown remotely by it pilot , Paul Nurkkala , shot through a gate at the top of a 131-foot-high tower , inverted into a roll and then dove toward the earth . Competitors trailed behind or crashed into piece along the course , but this one swerved and corkscrewed through two twin arch , hit a straightaway and then blasted into the netting that served a the finish line for the Drone Racing League ’ s world championship . The winning drone , a league-standard Racer3 , reached speed over 90 mile per hour , but it needed a human to guide it . Mr. Nurkkala , known to fan a Nurk , wore a pair of goggles that beamed him a first-person view of his drone a he flew it .
 Artificial intelligence , or A.I. , ha been on a hot streak , besting human in competition over the past five year . AlphaGo , a program built by DeepMind , the artificial intelligence arm of Google parent Alphabet , went from learning the basic of the game Go to beating the world ’ s best human player in a little over three year . More recently , the A.I . program AlphaStar , also by DeepMind , wa able to beat a top player in the complex strategy video game “ StarCraft II , ” shutting out it human competitor five game to zero .
 But the real world can be an immensely noisy place , and many A.I.-powered , and autonomous , vehicle still struggle to excel in it .
 In 2017 , NASA ’ s Jet Propulsion Laboratory built three autonomous drone and pitted them in a race against Ken Loo , an expert drone pilot . He easily beat them all . Darpa ’ s Fast Lightweight Autonomy program ha been able to send drone through tight hallway at 45 mile per hour , faster than the one from the University of Zurich , but in a le complex setting and slower than a human pilot . A piloted drone swooping and arcing around a course while an autonomous drone hesitantly chug through space is the difference between an N.B.A . point guard driving toward the basket and a toddler learning to walk .
 Onboard computer will get more powerful . Algorithms for developing optimal flight path will become optimized . New image processing technique will shrink the time it take for a computer to understand what it see from millisecond to microsecond , while the human eye will always have 13 millisecond of latency in processing visual stimulus . But that ’ s in the future . Right now , an autonomous drone completing a racecourse at a speed faster than 5.6 mile per hour will be an accomplishment .
 This year , a new competition will try to make sure autonomous drone are more nimble — and that they are truly able to act by themselves .
 “ Right now , autonomous drone are a thing you ’ d only find in lab , being pioneered by a small , niche audience , ” said Keith Lynn , Lockheed Martin ’ s program manager for AlphaPilot , an autonomous drone racing competition organized by the Drone Racing League .
 The AlphaPilot competition , which is sponsored by Lockheed Martin and part of the racing league ’ s new Artificial Intelligence Robotic Racing Circuit , aim to drive interest and research into self-driving , or autonomous , vehicle . Nine team will compete this fall , out of 430 currently making their way through qualifying round — student , A.I . researcher and independent drone enthusiast , among others — according to the organizer . The winning team will take home a prize of $ 1 million . If the A.I . drone can also beat a top human pilot in a head-to-head race , the team will get an extra $ 250,000 .
 Competitors , the league said , will program a Racer3 that includes an artificial intelligence chip made by Nvidia , a partner in the competition . The nine qualifying team will be announced this spring , according to the organizer .
 For autonomous drone to be useful — in disaster zone , a delivery vehicle or in rural area — they will need to be able to fly far , fast and without human oversight , often in environment where they can ’ t rely on external guidance system , like GPS . And that ’ s one of their biggest challenge .
 “ Current autonomous drone have very little onboard decision-making , ” said Kerry Snyder , a founder of KEF Robotics , a competing team from Pittsburgh . “ They will almost always be following very specific human command and rarely be able to accomplish higher level task such a ‘ Find a trapped person ’ or ‘ Fly through an open window and then explore . ’ ”
 There ’ s also a gap between code created in the lab and real-world flying . “ A lot of our A.I . is primarily developed in simulation , ” said Dr. Chelsea Sabo , technical lead of the AlphaPilot program at Lockheed Martin . “ Going from simulation to the real world is going to be a big challenge in AlphaPilot . ”
 Machine learning allows for A.I . to train much faster than flesh-and-blood pilot . A human who want to practice for 10,000 hour need three-and-a-half year of eight-hour day . A computer using machine learning can fly 10,000 simulated hour overnight .
 Eric Amoroso , another co-founder of KEF Robotics , said that autonomous vehicle can also be more precise than human pilot . Autonomous drone can fly more precisely by making subtle alteration to how much thrust each propeller produce , for example , he said , and can use information from sensor that human don ’ t have , like an accelerometer , to estimate where it is in space .
 But where human excel — and A.I . in general fall short — is in merging those individual skill into a cohesive whole , and doing it a fast a human are capable . “ Sensing the world , making decision , acting on it , and doing that in real-time , that ’ s really the fundamental challenge of robotics , ” Mr. Amoroso said .
 Autonomous drone also struggle to make sense of visual information , particularly at high speed , in part because of shortcoming in sensor . “ The main challenge of autonomous drone flight is perception based on camera , ” said Davide Scaramuzza , professor of robotics and perception at the University of Zurich and the creator of the autonomous drone that won the competition in Madrid last year . “ The faster the drone go , the more blurred the image get . ”
 A drone flying in the AlphaPilot competition will only be able to fly based on what it can see in front of it , and must use that information to know where it is in physical space . At 90 mile per hour , even at the calculating speed computer are capable of , an autonomous drone won ’ t be able to process image a fast a a human can , and may be thrown off course by something a simple a a shadow , leading it to miss a gate or believe it ’ s one foot to the right of where it actually is . At best , this mean the autonomous drone will need to course correct , slowing it down . At worst , it crash .
 There ’ s also the issue of strategy . “ A pilot with thousand of hour of flight time isn ’ t just thinking about the gate in front of them , ” Mr. Nurkkala , the racing league champion , said . “ They ’ re thinking about the next five or six gate , and how to position themselves to keep the best racing line. ” Inside a simulator , an AlphaPilot drone might be able to make those same sort of tactical and strategic plan . On a real-world course moving at speed , it may just be doing it best to hit each gate .
 And going fast is a calculation of risk versus reward ; if you ’ re flying without ever crashing , Mr. Nurkkala said , you ’ re not flying a fast a possible . For team programming AlphaPilot drone , this will mean training those drone to make trade-off of when to speed up and when to play it safe — decision human often make instinctually . “ In our simulation , we can tune our system so that it finish the course 100 percent of the time , but it fly pretty slow , ” Mr. Snyder said . “ Or we can tune it to finish the course 20 percent of the time , but it fly much faster. ” The winner of the AlphaPilot competition — and of it $ 1 million grand prize — will likely be the team that not only optimizes it algorithm , but also take the smartest risk .
 And if an autonomous drone can outrace a human-controlled one ? “ In my opinion , it would be very similar to Deep Blue or AlphaGo , ” Mr. Snyder said , referring to the chess-playing computer and the DeepMind A.I . “ It represents a major step in technical progress and innovation , even if in a limited environment where an autonomous robot could realistically outperform a human . That ’ s in contrast to the infinite and fractal complexity of self-driving car . ”
 Mr. Lynn is more effusive : “ Everyone will know the programmer behind that team . They ’ ll be celebrity . Companies will want to endorse them . Kids will aspire to be them . That ’ s exciting from a STEM perspective . ”
 And Mr. Lynn belief professional pilot will also take notice . “ I think you ’ ll also see the human-piloted D.R.L . race change , a pilot learn from the efficiency that only a computer and code can hone in on , and approach maneuver in entirely new way . That ’ s exciting for the future of human and machine teamwork . ”

 Stop blaming yourselves . Blame the total lack of social support .
 By Caitlyn Collins
 Dr. Collins is the author of “ Making Motherhood Work : How Women Manage Careers and Caregiving . ”
 A lawyer and I stepped into a windowless conference room in her office building in Washington , D.C. , and she reflexively closed the door . I had forgotten to restock my tissue and would soon regret that . By then , I had been interviewing American mother about their work-family conflict for several week . I asked woman I had just met what their boss said to them when they announced a pregnancy , what their parental leave wa like , if they could ever work remotely when a child wa sick .
 This time , I didn ’ t get even 20 minute into the conversation before the woman I wa interviewing dissolved in tear .
 She recalled scrambling after her son wa born to accomplish two task : “ knitting back together ” from her C-section and assembling a patchwork of enough disability leave , vacation and sick day , and unpaid time off , to rest briefly and care for her infant son before returning to work . In the United States — the only country in the industrialized world without federally mandated paid maternity leave — this do-it-yourself approach is often the only option .
 “ You could have child , but the general expectation wa , if you made that choice , you needed to have a plan for someone else to care for them , ” the lawyer in Washington told me .
 Since 2011 , I ’ ve interviewed 135 middle-class employed mother in Sweden , Germany , Italy and the United States to understand their work-family conflict . ( I spoke to mother specifically because in wealthy nation , mother have historically been the focus of work-family policy and they ’ re still responsible for most housework and child care . They report greater work-family conflict and they use work-family policy more often than men . ) And I had a personal interest : I ’ d watched my own mother struggle to navigate her work and family obligation — a decade-long juggling act that involved occasionally toting my sister and me to boardroom meeting to nap in sleeping bag when babysitter fell ill or school closed . Years later , it seemed a though the conflict hadn ’ t eased for many of my peer .
 In the United States , almost every woman I interviewed had reached the same conclusion : It wa her — or her and her partner ’ s — responsibility to figure out child care , cobble together a leave of absence ( often unpaid ) , get on a preschool waiting list , find a babysitter , seek advice from friend and acquaintance , and engineer any number of other highly improvised coping technique . In the lawyer ’ s case , this meant , among other thing , joining a less-prestigious firm that demanded fewer hour and finding the right hands-free breast pump to multitask in her cubicle . The common thread in every conversation wa that the parent had to solve their problem themselves , no matter how piecemeal the solution .
 That all make perfect ( if outrageous ) sense : The United States ha the least generous benefit , the lowest public commitment to caregiving , one of the highest wage gap between employed men and woman , and among the highest maternal and child poverty rate of any Western industrialized nation .
 In the course of my interview , I discovered that American working mother generally blame themselves for how hard their life are . They take personal responsibility for problem that European mother recognize a having external cause . The lesson here isn ’ t for overwhelmed American parent to look longingly across the Atlantic ; it ’ s to emulate the Swedes , Germans and Italians by harboring the reasonable expectation that the state will help .
 All the American mother I interviewed said they felt enormous guilt and tension between their work and family commitment . So did the Italians . But Italian woman tended to blame the government for their problem : “ Social benefit ? Zero . Less than zero . Nobody help me , ” laughed one woman I met , a single mother working at a hospital in Rome . “ Does the government help me ? No , ” she said , “ but they should think about helping you a little bit . ”
 In Sweden , working mother I spoke with wanted full gender equality and expected to seamlessly combine paid work and child rearing . Mothers there also anticipated that the government would support them in these endeavor — and that ’ s exactly what the Swedish state , it work-family policy , and the country ’ s cultural ideal about work and motherhood do . When Swedish mother feel stressed , they tend to blame the country ’ s lofty expectation of what parenting should be . German mother ascribed their work-family juggling act , with it emphasis on traditional home life , to outdated cultural ideal .
 American woman who worked for company that provided flexible schedule and paid maternity leave described themselves a “ being very lucky ” or “ feeling privileged. ” This privatized approach taken by the United States government and employer exacerbates inequality among worker . Some elite employer elect to offer helpful work-family policy , meaning only certain worker — typically highly educated , salaried employee — receive these support . The employee most in need of support , however — vulnerable hourly-wage worker — are the one least likely to enjoy any work-family benefit . The highest-income earner in the United States are 3.5 time a likely to have access to paid family leave a those at the bottom of the pay scale .
 After three month of interview with mother in Sweden , I wa heartened to discover that the country in many way life up to it image a the place where woman come closest to having successful career and fulfilling family life . But consider the national policy focus responsible for that lifestyle : Sweden prize gender equality , universal child care and a “ dual earner-carer ” model that feature woman and men sharing breadwinning and child-rearing role .
 Women in Stockholm seemed confused or laughed out loud when I used the term “ working mother. ” “ I don ’ t think that expression exists in Swedish , ” an urban planner and mother of two told me . “ It ’ s not like there ’ s a ‘ nonworking mother , ’ ” she said . “ I mean , what else would she do ? ”
 But we can ’ t simply import social policy and hope they ’ ll have the same effect in a different context . For instance , American parent tend to marvel at Germany ’ s comparatively luxurious-sounding three-year parental leave , which wa available to new parent for decade . So I wa taken aback when many working mother in Germany told me they despised the policy because of the cultural stigma it heaped on their shoulder to not return to work until they absolutely had to . A teacher who went back to work before the end of the allowable parental leave described people telling her : “ You can not do this . You are selfish , you ’ re a career whore . ”
 “ Balance ” is a term that came up relentlessly in my conversation with woman in the United States . But framing work-family conflict a a problem of imbalance is merely an individualized way to justify a nation of mother engulfed in stress . It fails to recognize how institution contribute to this anxiety .
 The stress that American parent feel is an urgent political issue , so the solution must be political a well . We have a social responsibility to solve work-family conflict . Let ’ s start with paid parental leave and high-quality , affordable child care a national priority .
 Women — again , on this side of the Atlantic — routinely assume it ’ s their duty to stitch together time off after childbirth . Those fortunate to qualify for parental-leave benefit — even two month at full pay , or six week at partial pay — feel real gratitude for such slim provision . And in a country where most woman ( too often the poor and racial-ethnic minority ) receive no paid leave at all , that gratitude make sense . But being able to work and raise the next generation of taxpayer and employee should never be deemed a matter of mere “ luck . ”
 Everyone should feel entitled to more .

 MELBOURNE , Australia — After 170th-ranked Christopher Eubanks made it through the qualifying draw of a Grand Slam event for the first time last week , many of his friend from back in Atlanta began to grasp how far his career had come .
 It wa not because of the three qualifying match he had won , but rather because of who joined him for a practice before the Australian Open began : Serena Williams .
 “ Some of my friend who don ’ t really know tennis were saying , ‘ If he ’ s hitting with Serena , he must be pretty good , ’ ” Eubanks said .
 His session with her wa part of a new strategy for Williams , who is training with some of the best current player from the men ’ s tour to raise the intensity of her practice . In addition to Eubanks , Williams ha practiced this month with No . 15 Stefanos Tsitsipas , No . 21 Grigor Dimitrov , No . 39 Frances Tiafoe and No . 88 Bernard Tomic .
 Asked about her practice with such player , Williams said simply , “ It wa fun , ” but her coach , Patrick Mouratoglou , wa more loquacious .
 “ If she lift her level on a daily basis that much , she ’ s going to improve incredibly , ” he said .
 The early return from the strategy have been positive : Williams beat Eugenie Bouchard , 6-2 , 6-2 , in the second round on Thursday night , thwarting the resurgent Canadian with sharp , focused aggression . Williams wa particularly strong on her return , winning 61 percent of point on Bouchard ’ s serve .
 Mouratoglou said the shift to finding the best male opposition available wa “ a long-term plan , ” not a temporary trend .
 “ I think that it ’ s very important in your practice to be challenged , because I think that she can become much better than what she is already , ” Mouratoglou said . “ But in order to become better , if you ’ re not challenged , you have no chance . I thought that to be challenged at practice wa a good idea , so we tried once and we really loved it . ”
 That first try , Mouratoglou said , wa with the Australian player Thanasi Kokkinakis last year at Mouratoglou ’ s academy in France .
 “ She said : ‘ Wow , it wa great , great rhythm , and it ’ s tough . It push me , ’ ” Mouratoglou said . “ I thought she played incredible . ”
 Kokkinakis , who had beaten Roger Federer earlier that spring at the Miami Open , shared that assessment , marveling at his inability to push Williams back from her position on the baseline even with his hardest , heaviest shot .
 “ She ’ s so , so strong on the ball , ” he said . “ When I thought I hit some good shot that even some male player might even struggle with , she took it on the rise , handled it pretty well . ”
 Williams ha practiced with men throughout her career , usually employing a man a a full-time hitting partner . Most have been year removed from their active day on tour and had achieved modest ranking . Her longtime hitting partner Sascha Bajin peaked at 1149th ; his successor , Robbye Poole , reached 414th ; her current hitting partner , Jarmere Jenkins , reached a high of 190th .
 Mouratoglou said that Jenkins wa “ still hitting the ball really well , ” but that it wa important to shake Williams out of her routine with him when possible .
 “ She basically know where he ’ s going to hit in advance , because she hit with him every day , so there is no surprise , ” Mouratoglou said . “ She doesn ’ t feel that she ’ s challenged because she know him too well . I think that count a lot . And she control him , in a way , because he ’ s her employee . Even unconsciously , she make him play the way she want to , even if she doesn ’ t try to .
 “ So it ’ s completely different relationship with a professional player , because she ha to give him good rhythm , to give a good ball to him , too , so she can ’ t lose focus . ”
 Other top men and woman have shared practice court in the first month of the tennis season . Andy Murray and Naomi Osaka , for example , hit together for 30 minute at a tournament in Brisbane , Australia .
 Mouratoglou said that he emphasized to the men that they should not treat Williams differently from any other practice partner .
 He said he told Eubanks , “ Play for yourself — it ’ s your practice . ”
 Eubanks said the session with Williams helped him in his first-round loss Monday against 19th-seeded Nikoloz Basilashvili . Eubanks had set point to go up by two set to one on a player ranked 150 spot ahead of him .
 “ Serena hit , in my opinion , one of the cleanest ball in the history of tennis , ” Eubanks said . “ I wa working on absorbing pace , because she put enough pace on it that you ’ re really working the leg . I ’ m being a professional a I can , because you ’ re on the court with Serena Williams . You don ’ t want her to think you can ’ t play . ”
 Eubanks said he felt the effect of Williams ’ s intensity and skill the rest of the day .
 “ I practiced again in the evening , and I told my coach I felt like I did a lift today , because my quad are so sore from just hitting with her for an hour , ” he said .
 After Williams ’ s victory over Bouchard , the on-court interviewer Jim Courier joked that she should charge the men she hit with for lesson . Indeed , many of Williams ’ s past practice partner have been thriving in Melbourne : Tsitsipas , Tiafoe and Alexei Popyrin have reached the third round at the Open for the first time .
 “ Just to hit with a legend , especially Serena , it really gave me a great , great experience , ” Popyrin said after No . 7 Dominic Thiem retired from their second-round match Thursday . “ She gave me some tip after the hit , so it wa great . ”
 Tiafoe , whom Williams hit with several time while they were teammate at the Hopman Cup , had his best career victory on Wednesday when he beat fifth-seeded Kevin Anderson in the second round .
 Tiafoe said he had difficulty handling Williams ’ s zipping shot , a he wa more used to the spinning shot male player tend to use .
 “ I wa struggling , ” Tiafoe said of hitting with Williams . “ She hit the ball so hard . The court are fast ; it wa skidding . I mean , a little topspin , maybe ? I ’ m not used to the ball coming in that flat . That wa something I really had to adjust to . ”
 Mouratoglou said no man had turned down an offer to hit with Williams .
 “ And I don ’ t think any will say no , ” he said . “ It ’ s a great experience for them , too , and I think they ’ re curious how Serena is hitting , for real . ”
 For Eubanks , Williams ’ s story had particular resonance . His father coached him in Atlanta following many of the tactic and philosophy of Serena ’ s father , Richard Williams .
 “ Being able to see somebody who come from humble beginning , somebody who ha dealt with adversity her entire life , seeing someone who come from an unconventional tennis background , it show it can be done , ” he said .
 “ I ’ ve gotten to the point now where I don ’ t really get star-struck when I see people , ” he added . “ I ’ ve practiced with Fed a couple time . I ’ ve seen Novak , seen Rafa . You see them and understand that they ’ re people . But Serena , there ’ s something about her that ’ s almost larger than life . So when I got out there and she said my name , it took me back to a if I wa a little kid : ‘ Man , Serena Williams know my name ! ’ ”

 The Carpetbagger
 By Kyle Buchanan
 What will win the best picture Oscar ? This year , the precursor that are supposed to narrow the field have served only to spread the wealth : The top guild prize have gone to several movie , and you could still make a strong case for any of the eight nominee to ultimately prevail .
 So below , your Carpetbagger will do just that . Ranked in order of strength , here are the contender for best picture and the path each movie ha to potential Oscar victory .
 [ Fill out your Oscar ballot . ]
 In it favor : Alfonso Cuarón ’ s black-and-white art film ha real momentum . It tied “ The Favourite ” in picking up the most Oscar nomination , and two of those 10 were for the actress Yalitza Aparicio and Marina de Tavira , which signal that the actor ’ branch of the academy ha gotten behind the movie .
 Netflix ha spent an unprecedented amount on the “ Roma ” award bid , but there is real passion in the industry for this film set in Mexico City : Cuarón recently claimed the top prize from the Directors Guild of America , a strong predictor for best picture , a well a key trophy from the Golden Globes and Critics ’ Choice Awards . In a field filled with blockbuster , “ Roma ” offer a highbrow option that many voter will be eager to take .
 Working against it : Though the academy ha become more international a it try to diversify it membership , there is still real doubt about whether a foreign-language film can win best picture , let alone one distributed by Netflix , a streaming service that ha skeptic in the academy membership . A split between the winner of best picture and best director ha recently become common , and if you assume Cuarón is a lock to win best director , this may encourage voter to go a different way with best picture .
 In it favor : Based on a true story about a talented black pianist and his white driver , “ Green Book ” ha most often been compared to “ Driving Miss Daisy , ” a film that also took the best picture Oscar . In addition to nabbing three Golden Globes , this racial-issues comedy from Peter Farrelly won top honor from the Producers Guild of America , and the film that prevails there ha gone on to win best picture two-thirds of the time . ( The very first Producers Guild winner , in 1989 , wa , you guessed it , “ Driving Miss Daisy . ” )
 Working against it : No film ha been troubled by more awards-season controversy than “ Green Book. ” The family of the man played by Mahershala Ali ha come out against the movie , while both Farrelly and his star Viggo Mortensen have had to issue statement of apology : Mortensen for using a racial epithet at a “ Green Book ” screening , and Farrelly for a habit of flashing his genitals to crew member a a joke .
 Those controversy don ’ t even register for the many guild voter who love the film , but the academy ha a more diverse , discerning membership than the Producers Guild and may prove le beguiled : Farrelly ’ s inability to score a best-director nomination suggests that not every branch of the academy will give “ Green Book ” the green light .
 In it favor : “ BlacKkKlansman ” is one of only three contender to score nomination for directing , screenwriting and editing , the traditional sign of strength that a nominee can win . In fact , this Spike Lee hit ha had serious stamen all season , showing up in the nomination list for nearly every guild .
 Though he wa given an honorary Oscar in 2015 , Lee ha never won an Oscar competitively , and “ BlacKkKlansman ” represents the first time he ’ s even been nominated for best director and best picture , the sort of statistic that make you wince . Handing Lee one of those top prize would go a long way toward recognizing a director who should have been in the mix far earlier .
 Working against it : The academy ha a tendency to give the screenplay Oscar a a consolation prize to a director whose sensibility may still be too hip for the room , like Jordan Peele , Spike Jonze and Sofia Coppola . “ BlacKkKlansman ” is one of two film in the adapted-screenplay category up for best picture ( the other is “ A Star Is Born ” ) , and while it represents Lee ’ s strongest shot at winning an Oscar , voter could decide that award is enough .
 In it favor : This royal comedy from the director Yorgos Lanthimos tied “ Roma ” for the most Oscar nomination , and like “ BlacKkKlansman , ” it is one of only three best picture contender to score nomination for directing , screenwriting and editing . In addition to the best actress contender Olivia Colman , the supporting actress race made room for Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz from this movie , and since actor make up the biggest voting branch in the academy , it ’ s important to have them on your side .
 This weekend brings the Bafta Awards , which are the British equivalent of the Oscars , and if “ The Favourite ” can triumph there over “ Roma , ” the significant British contingent of the academy may be enough to put the film over the top .
 Working against it : Though “ The Favourite ” picked up a comedy Globe for Colman and recently managed a win with the editor ’ guild , it hasn ’ t yet notched the sort of stop-the-presses victory that make best picture more plausible .
 In it favor : If the Oscars want to reward a contender that scored with the viewing audience , there is no better pick than “ Black Panther. ” This Marvel movie wa a box-office phenomenon , and it ha enough real-world resonance to overcome voter ’ reluctance to reward a fantasy superhero movie : Crucially , “ Black Panther ” took the top prize from the Screen Actors Guild , where Chadwick Boseman delivered a stirring speech that many Oscar voter will remember .
 Working against it : Though “ Black Panther ” winning best picture would give u a capital-m Moment , it ’ s going to be awfully hard to get there when the film couldn ’ t manage Oscar nomination for it director , screenplay or any cast member .
 In it favor : On paper , no film nominated this year is more Oscar-friendly than “ A Star Is Born. ” Like the recent best picture winner “ Birdman ” and “ The Artist , ” it ’ s a well-reviewed movie that ’ s essentially about Hollywood itself , but unlike those two film , “ A Star Is Born ” became a bona fide blockbuster .
 Working against it : Replace Lady Gaga ’ s triumphant “ Shallow ” wail with the sound of a sad trombone , and you ’ ll have an idea of just how much “ A Star Is Born ” ha underperformed this award season . The film hasn ’ t taken any of the major win it wa tipped for , and at the Directors Guild Awards on Saturday , Bradley Cooper even lost the first-time filmmaker prize to the director of “ Eighth Grade , ” Bo Burnham . I ’ m starting to think that the Oscars could add a specific category just for “ A Star Is Born , ” and yet , somehow , “ Roma ” would still win it .
 In it favor : Adam McKay ’ s darkly comedic Dick Cheney biopic can ’ t be counted out : It wa among the few movie to score nomination in directing , screenwriting and editing , and like “ The Favourite , ” it managed to push three actor — Christian Bale , Amy Adams and Sam Rockwell — into Oscar contention . If the mostly liberal academy want to thumb it nose at Republican leadership in Washington , “ Vice ” offer perhaps the most overt way of doing so .
 Working against it : Reviews and box office weren ’ t a strong a they could have been .
 In it favor : This Queen biopic is a global phenomenon that voter clearly love . Though it ’ s practically inconceivable to imagine that a movie directed by the fired Bryan Singer could go on to win best picture , Oscar ’ s top award would actually go to the producer Graham King , whom many in the industry respect for sticking a tough landing .
 Working against it : After # MeToo , would voter really reward a movie whose deposed director wa the subject of recent sexual-misconduct allegation in The Atlantic ? ( Singer ha called the article a “ homophobic smear piece. ” ) The best actor category give “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” fan an easy , respectable place to recognize the movie with a win for Rami Malek , and that may be enough .

 A peacock , a hippo , a monster and a unicorn each take to the stage , performing choreographed move while belting pop tune like “ Don ’ t Stop Me Now ” and “ Oops … I Did It Again. ” No , you didn ’ t eat one too many edible . You ’ re watching “ The Masked Singer , ” Fox ’ s new competition series that pit 12 extravagantly costumed celebrity against each other . An adaptation of a South Korean series called “ The King of Mask Singer , ” the American version debuted earlier this month to an audience of more than nine million viewer .
 Because the identity of each famous participant is kept secret until the contestant is voted off the show , “ The Masked Singer ” can ’ t rely on the spectacle of their star power . ( The host Nick Cannon , along with the celebrity panelist that include Jenny McCarthy and Robin Thicke , are low-wattage at best . )
 That ’ s where costume designer Marina Toybina come in . A four-time Emmy winner , Toybina got her big break working on Britney Spears ’ s 2007 music video , “ Piece of Me , ” and ha since collaborated with other A-list pop star , including Ariana Grande , Taylor Swift and Miley Cyrus . And remember when Katy Perry wa famously upstaged by two anthropomorphic dancing shark during her 2015 Super Bowl halftime show ? Toybina deserves much of the credit for the joy that Left Shark brought to our life .
 Toybina spoke to The New York Times about her knack for idiosyncratic animal outfit and creating full-body costume that won ’ t suffocate the person inside . ( Hint : hidden fan . ) These are edited excerpt from the conversation .
 If you saw what I wa wearing right now , you ’ d probably die . I work from home .
 Girl , I just had a newborn . I ’ m in , like , two robe . I feel you .
 You seem to have carved out a niche for yourself a a creator of elaborate viral animal costume . First , the infamous shark for Katy Perry ’ s Super Bowl halftime show ; and there were a couple of design you did for Pink ’ s 2018 tour that involved some very realistic animal mask that look somewhat like the one on “ The Masked Singer . ”
 Somehow , they ’ re all coincidence . Going back to the Super Bowl , that wa a pretty incredible experience . It wa the first time I ’ d ever dealt with puppetry , so we had to figure out how to start from scratch and learn the entire process day by day . Then in the beginning of last year , I did the costume for Pink ’ s tour , and the idea wa to have this very avant-garde forest scene where it ’ s like , half human , half animal . So there were mask involved there , which wa like my trial-and-error before “ The Masked Singer . ”
 After designing Pink ’ s tour , two month later I got a call from one of the producer of the show and she sent me the original concept . I watched a few episode and I wa like , “ Oh my gosh , we just did this. ” Everything I ’ ve learned in the past five , 10 year led me to figure out how to do this show .
 So you don ’ t have a secret animal fetish .
 No , not at all ! To be honest when I got the call I wa just like , “ What is happening with all these animal ? ”
 The costume almost reminded me of Julie Taymor ’ s animal in the Broadway version of “ The Lion King ” — it ’ s almost just a suggestion of the animal , rather than a literal rendering .
 The idea wa always to combine the element of fashion with costume . So the costume part of it becomes the mask , and the fashion part of it became the outerwear . It wasn ’ t so literal . The deer that I created almost look like a soldier . We put a lot of detail into aging the jacket and creating the element of this character .
 Every character had some sort of world that they lived in . I ’ m such a big fan of movie and the one thing I haven ’ t really done in my career is film . I wa able to introduce everything that I wa inspired by — “ Donnie Darko ” and “ Edward Scissorhands ” had a huge influence on the rabbit costume . The whimsical side of Narnia had a little bit of an influence on the lion and the unicorn .
 How did you conceive of the design for the show ? Did you first come up with the costume and then the contestant chose which one they liked ? Or did they have more input ?
 All the artwork wa done before the casting , and once we were working with the casting , the producer and I we were able to figure out which 12 we wanted to keep . From there it wa more collaborating , letting some of the cast member possibly choose their own costume or u hearing who ’ s being cast and thinking , “ This would be a perfect costume for this person. ” Somehow it just magically worked , even though it wa trial and error .
 It sound like you have really good karma !
 Usually when you sketch a 2D design , you do a lot of alteration to it when you start building the costume . If you look at the original sketch for the show versus the costume that are onstage , we barely had any change . I think it gave our celebrity , the famous behind-the-mask persona , a little bit of freedom to play around and become these character because what they saw on paper is exactly what they look like onstage . It almost became like an inner-child experience for a lot of these people , an alter ego — to go out , cover their face and become this character and truly have fun with it . I think that ’ s what made this show come to life .
 How do your design differ from those on the Korean version ?
 The one difference is how anime some of the [ Korean-designed ] mask were . I wanted to bring something that wa a little bit more of a 360 [ -degree ] mask that really hid our talent and embodied all these character . A lot of the Korean element had this extravagant mask and extravagant shoulder piece but then everything else wa kind of toned down . We created fuller costume , head-to-toe character .
 One of my favorite designer is [ Alexander ] McQueen and I made sure the lion and the unicorn had this couture-y drape work that you don ’ t even see anymore . I think both fashion and costuming , the art of it is slowly going away . You see more and more digital work in film , in music video . It wa important for me to design this show the old-school way . It wa important to do it all by hand .
 Does anyone ever complain that their costume is too heavy or difficult to move around in ?
 Of course — you know , a costume is a costume . The difference between the stuff you buy at the store and a costume [ is ] you are going to have weight . You are going to have extra protection , extra seam , extra material , extra lining . But we were able to adapt different way for the costume to be removed so they can breathe . Everything from the way they were constructed wa considered — breathing mechanism , putting fan inside of mask , putting fan inside of the monster costume . Just making sure that we can circulate oxygen .
 Do you have a favorite costume ?
 It ’ s hard to choose one but a far a intricacy I think the lion would probably be the one that took the longest to figure out , and a lot of heart and soul went into that one .
 What is your ultimate career goal a a designer ?
 My biggest dream is to do film . I would absolutely love to work with someone like Tim Burton . Looking at movie like “ Mary Poppins [ Returns ] ” or “ The Nutcracker [ and the Four Realms ] , ” that ’ s something I would love to do .
 So , a trippy adaptation of a beloved classic .
 If these character on the show could be part of Marvel , that would be amazing .

 ( Want to get this briefing by email ? Here ’ s the sign-up . )
 Good morning ,
 We start with the aftermath of last week ’ s mosque attack in New Zealand , deadly flooding in the Midwest , and the field for the N.C.A.A . men ’ s basketball tournament .
 Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern ordered an inquiry today into what her government could have known about the gunman before the terrorist attack at two mosque in Christchurch last week that left at least 50 people dead . She also said that her cabinet had agreed “ in principle ” to an overhaul of New Zealand ’ s gun law .
 The suspect in the attack , a 28-year-old Australian , obtained a basic firearm license in November 2017 and bought four weapon online . We compared rule for gun purchase in 16 country .
 Closer look : Interviews with survivor , and video of the attack and it aftermath , suggest that a bystander and police preparedness may have helped limit the toll .
 How to help : Here ’ s our guide to group offering aid to the victim .
 The Daily : In today ’ s episode , a Times technology columnist discus how the attack wa , in some way , made by and for the internet .
 A review of the data and voice recorder recovered from the jetliner that went down in Ethiopia found similarity between that crash and one involving the same Boeing model in Indonesia last year , Ethiopia ’ s Transport Ministry said Sunday .
 The disclosure came on the same day a memorial service in Addis Ababa . Many family don ’ t expect to ever recover remains because the 157 victim died in a fiery explosion .
 Related : When the 737 Max wa introduced , Boeing and regulator agreed that pilot who had flown an earlier model didn ’ t need additional simulator training . After two deadly crash in five month , that decision is now a focus of the investigation .
 William Singer , who worked in the college counseling business for the better part of three decade , built a national brand appealing to parent ’ worry about their child ’ s prospect .
 Federal prosecutor say he wa the mastermind behind an elaborate effort to pay off coach and test monitor , fake exam score , and fabricate student biography — all to help wealthy parent cheat their child ’ s way into desirable college . Our reporter looked into Mr. Singer ’ s background .
 Another angle : For student who have followed the rule of the college admission process , now is the nerve-racking time of year when they wait to hear whether they ’ ve been accepted . “ It ’ s a very long journey and now I ’ m just waiting for that moment , ” one said .
 Notable : The scandal , in which 33 parent have been charged so far , demonstrates what our reporter call “ snowplow parent , ” who clear away any obstacle to their child ’ s success .
 Many of the candidate running for president favor legalizing the drug , a view that ha become a pillar of progressive politics . People of color are imprisoned at disproportionate rate for drug offense , and legalization ha become a test of candidate ’ commitment to equal treatment in criminal justice and to fighting economic inequality .
 Yesterday : Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York officially entered the Democratic race .
 Go deeper : Democrats have won the presidency with nominee under 52 . But age may be relative in 2020 , with many younger voter preferring Bernie Sanders , 77 .
 Perspective : In an Op-Ed , a journalist and a farmer in Iowa argue that Democrats need to know how to speak to voter in rural America if they hope to succeed .
 Saudi Arabia ha a history of going after dissident and other Saudi citizen abroad , but the crackdown ha increased sharply since Prince Mohammed bin Salman wa elevated to crown prince in 2017 .
 The prince authorized a clandestine campaign that included the surveillance , kidnapping , detention and torture of Saudi citizen , according to American official who have read classified report about the effort . The campaign included the killing of Jamal Khashoggi , pictured on the poster above during a memorial last year .
 Attack in the Netherlands : A gunman killed at least three people and injured five on a tram in the Dutch city of Utrecht . A suspect wa in custody .
 Dispute over Huawei : A U.S. push to prevent the use of the Chinese company ’ s equipment in next-generation wireless network ha faltered . Some ally have rejected the American argument that Huawei and other Chinese company pose a security threat .
 Midwest flooding : At least two people have died after record-high river level across the region , particularly in Iowa and Nebraska .
 Deadly cyclone in Africa : The death toll ha risen to at least 150 , and hundred more were missing , after a huge storm struck Malawi , Mozambique and Zimbabwe .
 Arrest in mob killing : The arrest of a 24-year-old man ha led the authority to suspect that the shooting of the reputed leader of the Gambino crime family had more to do with a personal dispute than Mafia tie .
 Fox News suspension : The network removed Jeanine Pirro ’ s program from it prime-time slot on Saturday after the host questioned a Muslim lawmaker ’ s patriotism . President Trump urged Fox to bring her back .
 Snapshot : Millions of orange butterfly like the one above , called painted lady , are migrating across Southern California this month . Substantial rainfall in the desert near the border with Mexico , where the insect lay their egg , ha caused the unusually large swarm , scientist say .
 N.C.A.A . basketball : Duke , Gonzaga , North Carolina and Virginia secured the top seed in the men ’ s tournament , the first round of which begin Thursday . Here ’ s a printable bracket . The field for the woman ’ s tournament is to be announced tonight .
 What we ’ re reading : Jennifer Jett , an editor in Hong Kong , recommends this essay in Quartz . Jenny Anderson , a former New York Times reporter , writes about how her brother ’ s death spurred her to focus on building real-life connection and community a “ an insurance policy against life ’ s cruelty . ”
 Cook : “ Slow-roasted ” citrus salmon take about 30 minute , and it ’ s nearly impossible to overcook . ( Our Five Weeknight Dishes newsletter ha more recommendation . )
 Watch : The trailer for “ Avengers : Endgame ” may look familiar : It us footage from previous Marvel film going all the way back to “ Iron Man . ”
 Go : “ Skinnamarink , ” a new play from the troupe known a Little Lord , explores schooling and humiliation . We made it a Critic ’ s Pick .

 The next column will focus on advice , both that worked and that didn ’ t . Share your story of wisdom at crowdwise @ nytimes.com .
 NASA is planning the first all-female spacewalk this month .
 The first spacewalk wa on this day , in 1965 , by the cosmonaut Alexei Leonov . It wa a major Soviet advance in the space race .
 The plan had been kept secret , so Soviet broadcast of the event caught most of the world by surprise , including Lieutenant Colonel Leonov ’ s family . “ What is he doing ? ” his 4-year-old daughter cried . “ Please tell Daddy to get back inside . ”
 After he retired , Mr. Leonov revealed how many time the mission had neared disaster . In the 2004 book “ Two Sides of the Moon , ” he detailed how high pressure in his spacesuit had nearly prevented him from re-entering the capsule .
 Then a system failure forced the two-man crew to manually guide re-entry . They landed in Siberia , without communication , and endured day of frigid temperature , with one pistol to ward off wolf .
 After they were found , the pair skied mile to a rescue helicopter .
 The most-emailed article by Times reader over the weekend wa an Op-Ed about Tanitoluwa Adewumi , an 8-year old refugee from Nigeria who ha just won a New York State chess championship . He life with his family in a shelter in New York City .
 That ’ s it for this briefing . See you next time .

 [ What you need to know to start the day : Get New York Today in your inbox . ]
 CONCORD , N.H. — Senator Cory Booker ’ s visit to a house party in New Hampshire last month had many hallmark of a campaign visit . He mingled with guest . He posed for photo . He gave a speech . He stood for more photo .
 But he did not touch a sprawling table of homemade dessert .
 “ Today I ’ ve had everything from the winter vegetable salad at one place with brussels sprout and broccoli . Some raw food , ” Mr. Booker said within eyeshot of the spread of sweet . “ It wasn ’ t all raw — it wa quinoa. ” He elongated the name a if to emphasize it exoticness . Keen-waaaaah . “ Am I pronouncing that right ? ” ( He wa . )
 As Mr. Booker , 49 , prepares for an expected 2020 presidential campaign , a former top college football recruit and self-proclaimed first vegan in Senate history ha slimmed down to what may be his best shape in year .
 While Mr. Booker ha not yet announced his candidacy , getting in better shape or losing weight ahead of a White House bid — a physically and emotionally taxing endeavor — is hardly uncommon , with Jeb Bush and Chris Christie the most recent example .
 Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York , another likely 2020 candidate , posted a photograph of her birthday workout on a Pilates Reformer machine from when she turned 52 last month . A few day earlier , she had shared a picture of her bulging her biceps at the gym , hoisting two 17.5-pound weight overhead .
 “ Lead like a girl , ” her shirt read .
 Both Mr. Booker and Ms. Gillibrand , also a former college athlete , waved off suggestion that their physique had anything to do with presidential fitness , and it ’ s true that they have both lost dozen of pound in the past .
 “ My goal is to turn 50 in some of the best shape of my life , ” Mr. Booker said . “ It ha nothing to do with any other plan . ”
 Ms. Gillibrand declined to be interviewed for this story , but did say after a recent event in Brooklyn , “ My health ha always been important . And I think it ’ s an issue for most working mom just how can we integrate our health into our daily life . That ’ s what it ’ s been about for me . ”
 So far , among potential 2020 candidate , the two senator from New York and New Jersey have followed in the lightened footstep of the like of Mr. Bush . And in a race that could be cleaved along generational line , the ( relative ) youth of Mr. Booker and Ms. Gillibrand could be an asset a they contend with some better-known rival who are in their 70 or close to it , like the former vice president Joseph R. Biden Jr. , or Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren . And , like it or not , being physically fit can project a youth .
 In early January , Frank Biden , Mr. Biden ’ s brother , bragged about the former vice president ’ s prowess in the weight room . “ Joe bench 185 for repetition , ” Frank said on Michael Smerconish ’ s radio talk show . “ The image of him on the bench with gritted teeth and powering through that last rep is a very accurate one . ”
 A long history exists of candidate preparing for a presidential run not just by making early-state contact and fund-raising call but also with gym visit and calorie counting .
 In 2015 , Mr. Bush declared for president far leaner than he had been during two term a Florida governor . He talked regularly about how his “ Paleo diet ” helped him shed “ 40 pound in six month , ” a he revealed in an interview at a Dairy Queen in Iowa .
 In 2013 , Mr. Christie , then the New Jersey governor , underwent weight loss surgery ahead of his 2016 run .
 Back in 2011 , Haley Barbour , the former governor of Mississippi , liked to joke that one could track his likelihood of running for president by tracking his weight loss . He did not lose much weight ; he did not run .
 The Rev . Al Sharpton , who wa heavyset when he ran for president in 2004 , said he ha noticed both Ms. Gillibrand and Mr. Booker ’ s thinning profile .
 Recently , Mr. Sharpton , the civil right leader who lost about 175 pound , met privately with Ms. Gillibrand before a joint news conference . She marveled at his ability to keep the weight off . He returned the compliment , telling her she wa “ looking even sharper ” of late , Mr. Sharpton recalled .
 “ And she say , ‘ Well , reverend , you ’ ve got to always watch what you do. ’ So I wa saying , ‘ Yes , especially if you have other plans. ’ She said , ‘ We ’ ll talk about that another time , ’ ” Mr. Sharpton said of their exchange . “ I wa trying to bait her into telling me if she wa going to run . But she did not give that away . ”
 All joke aside , he said that a candidate ’ s weight can shape voter perception .
 “ Optics are important in politics , ” Mr. Sharpton said . “ And I think it doe not hurt to look fit , because people want people that they feel take themselves seriously if they ’ re going to put the affair of the state in their hand . ”
 In the past , Ms. Gillibrand ha been open about her weight . In 2012 she detailed her hour-by-hour daily diet for Self magazine ( “ Snack : 10 almond ” ) , after losing 40 pound after the birth of her second child .
 She devoted a chapter about her body and gender expectation in her book , including sexist commentary congressional colleague said to her ( “ You know , Kirsten , you ’ re even pretty when you ’ re fat ” and “ Don ’ t lose too much weight now . I like my girl chubby ” ) .
 “ I don ’ t like being judged on my look and , frankly , I ’ d like to spend le time thinking about my appearance , but there it is , ” she wrote . But she came to see the benefit of opening up about her weight battle . “ I ’ d always wanted voter to know that I ’ m a tenacious person , and what finally convinced them wa that I ’ d possessed the determination to lose 50 pound . ”
 Mr. Booker and Ms. Gillibrand are close ( on his birthday last year , she hand-delivered him a carrot vegan cupcake ) even if they are on an expected collision course later this year . “ She and I definitely have a mutual affirmation encouragement friendship , ” Mr. Booker explained in New Hampshire .
 For year , Mr. Booker , too , ha documented on social medium what he called his “ up and down , up and down , up and down ” weight battle . He ha been a vegetarian for more than 25 year and became a vegan more recently .
 He ha intermittently fasted and eaten load of vegetable of late . “ For me , it ’ s not complicated and most all of u know it . Just try not to eat the empty carbs , the sugar , ” he said .
 Some in his circle recall a brief foray into an all-potato diet ( yes , that is really a thing ) . His staff declined to confirm or comment on any potato period .
 But Mr. Booker can not deny his adoration for roasted cauliflower , which he photographed and posted to Instagram in March . “ I find myself more and more rejoicing in the delicious simplicity of a whole food , plant-based diet , ” he wrote then .
 Reminded of the picture , Mr. Booker said that he did “ remember the cauliflower. ” It wasn ’ t even on Mr. Booker ’ s plate that day ; he wa fasting .

 CARACAS , Venezuela — Hundreds of thousand of Venezuelan opposition supporter poured into the street on Saturday , heeding a call from their leader to stage another day of peaceful protest against President Nicolás Maduro ’ s authoritarian rule in hope of capitalizing on international pressure to force him from power .
 In another boost for the opposition , a top air force official and a man identifying himself a a Venezuelan ambassador released separate video breaking with Mr. Maduro and pledging allegiance to Juan Guaidó , the opposition leader . They were two of the highest-level defection yet in the country ’ s growing political crisis .
 “ Ninety percent of the armed force do not support Nicolás Maduro , ” said Division Gen. Francisco Esteban Yánez Rodríguez , the air force official . “ I ask my comrade in arm to not turn their back on the people of Venezuela , do not repress anymore . ”
 In another video released in the evening , a man identifying himself a Jonathan Velasco , the Venezuelan ambassador to Iraq , said Mr. Guaidó “ stood on the right side of history ” and wa the country ’ s rightful leader .
 The crack in Mr. Maduro ’ s armor have started to add up .
 American official said they would no longer pay his government for oil sale in the United States , a principal source of Mr. Maduro ’ s hard currency .
 The United States and more than two dozen other country no longer recognize him a Venezuela ’ s president . And Mr. Guaidó ha declared himself the country ’ s legitimate leader , calling on the armed force to join him in toppling Mr. Maduro .
 While Venezuela ’ s top military brass ha come out in support of Mr. Maduro , Mr. Yánez joined a growing list of defector — including the military attaché of the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington — who have urged the armed force to align with the opposition .
 Few time in Venezuela ’ s recent history ha so much appeared to be hanging on a protest movement — and it ability to get the military , Venezuela ’ s chief power broker , to side with it .
 “ This is our best political opportunity , ” said Margarita Lopez Maya , a retired political scientist in the capital , Caracas , who ha spent decade studying the strongman of the country ’ s past and who headed out on Saturday to join the crowd . “ Right now , it ’ s the moment of the citizen . ”
 Throngs of demonstrator converged on Avenida Principal de la Mercedes , a wide boulevard in a middle-class Caracas neighborhood . Whistles sounded and driver beeped their horn , with no evident sign of the authority ’ cracking down .
 Many carried yellow , blue and red Venezuelan flag and banner supporting democracy . One man knelt in prayer before a sign that read , “ This struggle is for those who have fallen and for our Fatherland . ”
 Francisco Rodríguez , an economist at Torino Capital , said the firm had estimated turnout at over 800,000 people .
 Around midday , Mr. Guaidó took to a large stage before his supporter and pleaded with the international community to send humanitarian aid and protect the movement he ha fostered .
 “ The next day will be decisive . In the next hour , we will have the support of even more country , ” he said , warning that the world wa watching to see whether Mr. Maduro ’ s security force would crack down .
 As the national anthem played , Aidé de Ramírez , a 67-year-old merchant drenched in sweat , marveled that there were no security force in sight , no volley of buckshot , no cloud of tear gas . “ I hope something within them ha changed , ” she said .
 Francys Rodríguez , a 39-year-old Catholic nun , stepped out from a group of sister to extol the virtue of the opposition leadership .
 “ The presence of Guaidó wa sent by divine providence because no one expected it , ” said the nun , who work in a local high school . “ We are living this problem more than anyone . The kid at the school , they come to u without breakfast , without eating at all . We are all feeling this tragedy . ”
 Whether protest alone can catalyze a shift in the political standoff in Venezuela is far from clear . As Mr. Maduro broke the power of the opposition-controlled legislature in 2017 , demonstrator took to the street for four month , only to be beaten back in clash with Mr. Maduro ’ s security force that left more than 100 people dead .
 But this time , Mr. Maduro is not only facing a challenge on his street , but increasing unity among his neighbor in the region that his rule is over .
 Mr. Guaidó ’ s government ha been busy appointing a team of de facto ambassador to argue it case among the country that have recognized him . American sanction on Venezuela ’ s state-run oil company could topple the country ’ s long-crippled economy .
 On Thursday , the European Parliament recognized Mr. Guaidó a president . That fell short of protester ’ demand for recognition from the European Union itself , but France , Britain , Spain and Germany are expected to follow suit in the coming day .
 “ It ’ s perhaps the first time in year that the street isn ’ t the only factor in this game , ” said Yon Goicoechea , a lawyer and political activist who ha been imprisoned by Mr. Maduro ’ s government .
 “ If the government represses u a they have been , if they throw u all in jail , it won ’ t solve the problem , ” he added . “ This time , the problem isn ’ t just demonstration , but the pressure that their economy is suffocating and their diplomatic isolation . ”
 Since Mr. Guaidó began his bid to oust Mr. Maduro , at least 40 people have been killed in clash with protester , human right group say , a steep escalation from previous protest movement in 2014 and 2017 . Many hundred have been jailed , according to human right group .
 The crackdown ha been made more lethal by Mr. Maduro ’ s deployment of a special police unit against activist , whose rank may have included civilian vigilante . Mr. Guaidó said the unit wa sent to his home , a move the politician said wa meant to “ intimidate ” him and his family .
 At an event in Miami on Friday , Vice President Mike Pence again gave strong support to the protester in Venezuela .
 “ Across that country , in the largest city and the smallest town , people are rising up in defense of their right , ” he said . “ This is no time for dialogue , this is the time for action . And the time ha come to end the Maduro dictatorship once and for all . ”
 While Mr. Maduro remains unpopular among the vast majority of Venezuelans , some said they were not willing to join Mr. Guaidó on Saturday .
 Andrea Pacheco , a 30-year-old editor who work for a left-wing news site in Caracas , said she recently became fed up with Mr. Maduro ’ s government and even attended the opposition protest on Jan. 23 .
 But she said Mr. Guaidó ’ s swearing in a “ interim president ” wa a step too far for those like her who spent year backing the country ’ s former leftist president , Hugo Chávez . The opposition , she said , “ seems to forget that without the people who are the true Chavistas , they won ’ t be able to make it . ”
 On Saturday , Mr. Maduro held a rally of his own before a crowd composed of supporter wearing red , the color of his socialist party , and uniformed member of a pro-government militia group . The turnout wa far smaller than that of the opposition , expert said .
 While it appeared to be a counter-rally to Mr. Guaidó ’ s , he focused on the 20th anniversary of the inauguration of his predecessor , Mr. Chávez , whom he said had led “ a new history of deep transformation ” for the country .
 Mr. Maduro said he wanted to move up election for the opposition-controlled National Assembly by a year — a proposal he ha made before , and one seen by the opposition a a threat to wipe out it majority .
 David Smilde , an analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America , a human right group , said it wa unclear whether Saturday ’ s protest were a make-or-break moment for Mr. Guaidó , but recent demonstration had delivered the opposition result for the first time in year .
 “ The successful protest on the 23rd brought about result , ” said Mr. Smilde , referring to the American sanction and international recognition of Mr. Guaidó . “ People can say now , ‘ I participated and I saw thing happen. ’ That can lead them to decide to come out again . ”

 Good morning .
 The U.S. and Canada ban Boeing ’ s 737 Max 8 jet , Britain prepares for another Brexit vote and China grapple with a falling birthrate . Here ’ s the latest :
 The U.S. and Canada , some of the last holdout , grounded all Boeing 737 Max 8 jet in the wake of a crash in Ethiopia , essentially pulling the plane from almost everywhere in the world .
 President Trump issued the ban , reversing an earlier decision by American aviation regulator to keep the plane in service . His announcement came despite a personal appeal from the chief executive of Boeing , who spoke to the president by phone Tuesday to express confidence in the safety of the jet .
 Here ’ s a simple guide to all the development in the aftermath of the Ethiopian Airlines crash on Sunday .
 What went wrong : Though no cause ha been determined yet , one of the Ethiopian Airlines pilot reported “ flight-control problem ” to air traffic controller , requesting permission to turn back minute before the crash .
 Another angle : China wa among the first country to ground 96 of the 737 Max 8 jetliner operated by Chinese carrier , proving that effort to enhance aviation safety in the country have worked .
 After soundly rejecting Prime Minister Theresa May ’ s withdrawal plan twice , British lawmaker voted against leaving the E.U . without a deal .
 What next ? Parliament will reconvene on Thursday to vote on whether to postpone the country ’ s withdrawal , a measure that ha popular support , but then the question becomes for how long and to what purpose .
 If Parliament vote for an extension , Mrs. May will have to seek permission to delay Brexit from E.U . leader next week .
 Some lawmaker want to take nonbinding vote on alternative to Mrs. May ’ s failed plan . There is talk of a second referendum to confirm public support for Brexit and speculation about a general election to shake up a logjammed Parliament .
 The flurry of vote and idea underscore Parliament ’ s attempt to wrest control of the Brexit process , just 16 day before the March 29 deadline .
 Go deeper : Mrs. May , who ha spent the last two and a half year surviving one political crisis after another , look weaker than ever this week . “ Journalists have long since exhausted all the available metaphor : Groundhog Day , high noon , crunch time , dead woman walking , ” writes our London-based correspondent Ellen Barry .
 At China ’ s annual legislative meeting , regional official , businesspeople and others seemed to be focused on one looming issue : a graying population and a dwindling workforce .
 Many suggested idea to address the problem , caused by falling birthrate , including lowering the legal age of marriage , banning discrimination of mothers-to-be in the workplace , and even removing all limit on how many child a couple can have .
 It ’ s unlikely that the government will heed this advice immediately , but the discussion and growing concern might hint at change to come later .
 Sticking point : One proposal that generated the most attention wa the removal of legal restriction on child born outside wedlock , a move that would upend rigid stigma against single mother .
 Background : For three decade , China aggressively enforced a “ one child ” policy to control it ballooning population . The government changed course only in 2016 to address slowing population growth , allowing virtually all family to have two child . But birthrate continued to fall in the past two year .
 In other China news : An activist in Kazakhstan who led one of the most influential effort to chronicle China ’ s detention of Muslim minority in the Xinjiang region ha been placed under house arrest , raising concern that Beijing wa trying to silence criticism even beyond it border .
 Rescuers scrambled to pull child out from under the wreckage of a three-story building that fell in on itself in the Nigerian city of Lagos . The building housed apartment a well a a nursery and a primary school . Hundreds of people had gathered at the site awaiting news of their child .
 Officials said several people had been killed but offered no death toll . The Red Cross in Lagos state said 36 people had been removed from the rubble , including some who were dead .
 Context : The rapidly growing city ha suffered a number of building collapse due , in large part , to shoddy construction and lax oversight .
 Onlookers and neighbor pointed out that the building had been marked with an “ X ” for demolition but wa refurbished not long ago . The state governor said the school had been operating illegally in the building .
 George Pell : The Australian cardinal who is the highest ranking Catholic official to be convicted of sexually abusing minor wa sentenced to six year in prison , far short of the 50-year maximum .
 U.S . Colleges : Fifty people , including Hollywood star and business executive , were charged in a sweeping investigation into an admission scheme to buy spot at Stanford , Yale and other competitive American university .
 Paul Manafort : President Trump ’ s former campaign chairman now face a total prison time of seven and a half year after a second federal judge added to the 47 month he received last week for tax and bank fraud in two case brought by the special counsel . On the same day , Mr. Manafort wa charged with mortgage fraud and more than a dozen other New York felony , an effort to ensure that he will face prison time even if President Trump pardon his federal crime .
 Iran : Nasrin Sotoudeh , a prominent Iranian human right lawyer who wa detained for eight month without explanation , ha been sentenced to 38 year in prison and 148 lash , her husband said . Ms. Sotoudeh wa known for defending woman who had been arrested for removing their head scarf in public protest .
 Afghanistan : For the second time in just a few day , an Afghan Army base wa completely destroyed , this time by American airstrikes that killed six soldier and wounded nine others , official said .
 Vietnam : A prominent historian who challenged Beijing ’ s territorial claim in the South China Sea wa expelled from the ruling Communist Party for comment he made on Facebook , underlining the country ’ s sensitivity around it relationship with China , it largest trading partner .
 K-pop : A singer , Jung Joon-young , apologized for filming and sharing intimate video of woman without their consent , just a the country wa reckoning with news that another celebrity , Lee Seung-hyun , who performed under the name Seungri , retired after being accused of “ offering sexual service ” at nightclub .
 Spotify : The music streaming platform filed a complaint with European regulator saying that Apple us fee for sale via it App Store to undercut competitor of it own service , like Apple Music .
 Amy Schumer : The comic , who is pregnant and ha faced an onslaught of criticism recently , claim she still doesn ’ t care what people think of her . “ Being cool is powerful in this industry , but there ’ s nothing more powerful than not giving a — , ” she told The Times ahead of the release of her new Netflix special , “ Growing . ”
 “ Captain Marvel ” : Even before the superhero movie , starring Brie Larson , wa released , negative audience review piled up , prompting site like Rotten Tomatoes to change the rule to prevent user from trying to manipulate a film ’ s box office success .

 The Times recently published a story about a Central Park detective who is retiring , along with his horse , from the New York Police Department . Which got u wondering about how mounted unit have managed to endure .
 One of the first on record is the London Bow Street Horse Patrol , established in the mid-18th century to patrol country road to ward off petty crime . The idea soon spread to city across Britain and around the world .
 These day , mounted officer are usually used for crowd control and easy navigation through traffic ( mobility and sightlines from horseback are better than on foot or in a car ) . And , according to a study in 2015 , the benefit go beyond that , to building public trust .
 In comparison to foot patrol , the report said , “ Mounted police were observed to generate over six time a many instance of casual public engagement — such a greeting and brief exchange — over equivalent time period in neighborhood patrol . ”

 The justice will hear oral argument in a contentious case involving whether consumer can order from out-of-state wine shop .
 By Eric Asimov
 With just a few click on my computer or phone , I can order a rare book from San Francisco , a country ham from Kentucky or a dazzling box of chocolate from Vermont . I can track the shipment to the door of my New York apartment building , where I will receive them , marveling at our effortless access to almost anything we desire .
 That modern convenience , however , is denied to wine lover who live in the 37 state that prohibit interstate shipping from retail wine shop . A consumer in a rural community , for example , with few good wine shop within easy reach , is forbidden to order wine from an out-of-state source with great bottle galore .
 This may change in the not-too-distant future . A case to be argued before the United States Supreme Court on Wednesday may decide whether state can prohibit retail wine shop from shipping to consumer in another state . A ruling might even affect access to small-production beer and spirit , although it 's not clear whether it would extend beyond wine .
 The case , Tennessee Wine and Spirits Retailers Association v. Blair , doe not hinge directly on the issue of interstate retail sale . It instead is focused on the effort of Total Wine & More , a national retail chain of almost 200 store , to open an outlet in Tennessee . A group of retailer in the state sued in an effort to block the move , arguing that Tennessee law required the retail owner to be resident of the state .
 Yet the court ’ s decision , many believe , will have major implication for interstate wine sale . It could open a wellspring of opportunity to consumer , allowing wine lover to scour the country for hard-to-find bottle and the best retail deal . Or it could put to rest any further effort to broaden access to fine wine .
 “ We ’ re about 90 percent sure it will affect interstate shipping , ” said Daniel Posner , the managing partner of Grapes the Wine Company , in White Plains , N.Y .
 Mr. Posner is the president of the National Association of Wine Retailers , an advocacy group , which ha filed a brief with the court in Blair arguing that the right of wine producer to sell and ship bottle to out-of-state consumer , granted in a 2005 case , Granholm v. Heald , should be extended to retailer .
 The Granholm case struck down state law that permitted wine producer to ship bottle directly to consumer in that state and barred out-of-state producer from the same practice . In-state and out-of-state producer must play by the same set of rule , the court said .
 But the Granholm ruling wa vague about whether it applied to retailer a well .
 Before the early year of this century , ordering wine from out-of-state merchant wa a minor part of the business , and drew little attention . Only the most committed collector , who sought access to out-of-state wine catalog , would go through the inconvenience and expense of such transaction .
 High-speed internet changed everything . With easy access to retail website , consumer anywhere in the country could order from specialty wine shop , purchasing bottle that might otherwise be unavailable in their own state .
 Given the irrational patchwork of regulation that governs wine distribution , every state essentially offer consumer a different selection of wine . For people who live in area rich with fine-wine retailer , internet shopping wa an added bonus . For those in area with few retail option , it wa a savior .
 As consumer became accustomed to shopping on their computer , interstate sale became a more significant part of the business for retailer , enough so to draw the attention of wine-and-spirits wholesaler , who felt themselves bypassed by such interstate sale .
 Urged on by the wholesaler , who lobbied and contributed heavily to state political campaign , state began to crack down on interstate retail shipping , and carrier like FedEx and United Parcel Service specifically . Those company have told retailer in recent year that they would no longer accept out-of-state shipment of alcoholic beverage unless they were bound for one of 13 state ( along with Washington , D.C. ) that explicitly permit such interstate commerce . Interstate wine shopping effectively ended for many people .
 While the Granholm decision did not specifically grant retailer the right to sell wine out of state , it did not prohibit it , either . The national retailer association — along with other proponent , including a group of 81 consumer , which also filed a brief in the case — is hoping that the court ’ s Blair decision will extend those right explicitly to retailer .
 “ As with a lot of Supreme Court case , there ’ s an issue that ’ s squarely before the court , but there are other issue that the court will have to sort through in making a decision that will have a lot of implication , ” said Paul D. Clement , a lawyer who filed the brief on behalf of the national retailer association .
 The original ruling in the Blair case , by a federal district judge , wa in favor of the Tennessee retailer association , which had defended the state residency requirement . But that wa overturned in early 2018 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit , which cited Granholm in ruling that in-state entity could not be favored over out-of-state entity .
 The Tennessee retailer — who , unlike the national association , favor the residency requirement — argue that the Granholm decision applies only to wine producer , not to retailer . If the court accepts that argument , it will end immediate consumer hope of regaining access to a wider selection of wine .
 Richard L. Colbert , a lawyer for the Tennessee retailer , declined to comment on the case . But Mr. Clement , who served a United States solicitor general from 2005 through 2008 , asserts that Granholm should logically extend to wine retailer .
 “ Your typical winery ha a production function and a retail function , and Granholm ’ s focus wa on the retail side , ” Mr. Clement said . “ The interstate activity protected by Granholm wasn ’ t production , it wa sale . ”
 Another recent case , Lebamoff v. Rauner , also challenged restriction on interstate retail shipment . In that case , the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit , in Chicago , rejected the argument that Granholm drew a clear distinction between producer and retailer . The importance of that opinion , though , will depend on how the Supreme Court rule in the Blair case .
 Because of the arcane nature of the case , it is difficult to speculate along political line what the court will do .
 “ All the normal left-right stuff just go out the window , ” Mr. Clement said . “ It becomes very difficult to predict , especially since there ’ s been a significant turnover in the court since Granholm . ”
 Of the nine justice in the 5-to-4 Granholm decision , only three remain : Justice Clarence Thomas , who dissented , and Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer , who sided with the majority .
 Ultimately , the case is a reminder of the tortured relationship that the United States ha had with alcoholic beverage since the passage of the 21st Amendment , which ended Prohibition in 1933 . That amendment left it to each state to impose it own law and regulation , which make the distribution of wine in the United States so difficult and confusing .
 In addition , producer nationwide are required to sell to retailer by way of wholesale distributor . This three-tier system vest great power in wholesaler , who have opposed any effort like Granholm or Blair to expand consumer access to wine .
 The Granholm decision wa the first to chip away at this archaic structure . The Blair case may be one more step toward freer access to fine wine .

 Good morning ,
 We start with renewed concern about Boeing ’ s 737 Max 8 , a preview of today ’ s White House budget proposal and a look at America ’ s intensifying fight against extremist in Somalia .
 The two country ordered their airline today to suspend all flight involving Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft , after the model wa involved in two deadly crash in the past five month . The most recent wa Sunday , when an Ethiopian Airlines flight went down near Addis Ababa , killing all 157 people onboard . Here are the latest update .
 The circumstance were eerily similar to the crash of a Lion Air flight off Indonesia in October that killed 189 . Early information on Sunday ’ s crash is incomplete and doe not rule out pilot error or a different malfunction .
 Background : The 737 Max 8 is an update to a model that is a linchpin for airline around the world , particularly in China . After the crash in Indonesia , some American aviation official said that a software update for the Max ’ s flight control system wasn ’ t adequately explained to pilot . Many airline have since provided training , but whether Ethiopian Airlines did so wa not immediately known.The passenger : The flight , which wa bound for Nairobi , Kenya , had been nicknamed the “ U.N . shuttle ” because of how often United Nations staff member took it . At least 22 employee of U.N.-affiliated agency were among those killed .
 Basic question : In the U.S. , American Airlines , Southwest Airlines and United Airlines all use the 737 Max . Here are some answer to common question .
 After a spending dispute that closed part of the government for a record 35 day , the president plan to ask for $ 8.6 billion for a wall on the southwestern border in the budget that he submits to Congress today , aide said .
 Mr. Trump will also ask for an additional $ 3.6 billion to replenish military construction fund that he ha diverted by declaring a national emergency .
 On Sunday , the Democratic leader , Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer , declared the deal dead on arrival : “ Congress refused to fund his wall , and he wa forced to admit defeat , ” they said in a joint statement . “ The same thing will repeat itself if he try this again . ”
 The detail : Aside from the proposed wall funding , Mr. Trump will call for increased military spending and significant cut in domestic program , neither of which Democrats are likely to accept .
 The extremist group in Somalia that is affiliated with Al Qaeda ha been the target of intensifying airstrikes by the U.S. military , even a President Trump ha sought to scale back other counterinsurgency operation .
 Last year , 47 disclosed attack in Somalia killed 326 people thought to be Shabab fighter , Defense Department data show — the third record high in three year . So far this year , the intensity is on a pace to eclipse the 2018 record .
 Background : The U.S. estimate that the Shabab have 5,000 to 7,000 fighter in Somalia , where the group control about 20 percent of the country . Late last month , the group claimed responsibility for an attack on a hotel in the capital , Mogadishu , that killed at least 25 .
 New York City wa riveted for week by a debate over whether Amazon should receive $ 3 billion in incentive in return for setting up a headquarters in Queens .
 But for more than a decade , the city ha been funneling even more aid to Hudson Yards , a 28-acre complex that ’ s set to open this week in Manhattan . In all , tax break and other government assistance for Hudson Yards have reached nearly $ 6 billion , according to public record and a recent analysis by the New School .
 Closer look : Supporters of the project say the incentive will pay vast dividend by creating a business district , but detractor voice the kind of criticism that reverberated during the Amazon deal : Wealthy business should pay their own way .
 Another angle : Hudson Yards includes a major dining complex with restaurant run by celebrity chef like David Chang and Thomas Keller .
 The Times reconstructed an episode last month in which an aid truck trying to cross a bridge connecting Colombia and Venezuela burst into flame . The analysis contradicts the idea promoted by the U.S. that force loyal to President Nicolás Maduro were to blame .
 The analysis , using unpublished footage along with previously released tape , suggests that a Molotov cocktail thrown by an antigovernment protester most likely caused the blaze inadvertently .
 Uncle Sam liked your photo : A Trump administration proposal would allow Social Security to monitor social medium post to identify people who are receiving federal disability benefit without being truly disabled .
 Blackout in Venezuela : The government ha declared today a public holiday after a fourth consecutive night of power failure .
 Tesla ’ s change of plan : Days after announcing that it would close most of it store , the electric-car maker ha said that it would keep “ significantly more store open ” than previously announced . The company also said it would raise most of it price .
 Ruling in “ Serial ” case : Adnan Syed , whose murder trial wa the subject of a hit podcast , ha been denied a new trial by Maryland ’ s highest court , reversing a decision from last year .
 Jussie Smollett indictment : A grand jury indicted the “ Empire ” actor on 16 felony count of disorderly conduct after the authority said he falsely reported that he had been attacked .
 Featured video : Ever put a grape in a microwave ? There is some real science behind the internet phenomenon .
 Weekend box office : “ Captain Marvel , ” starring Brie Larson , earned $ 153 million in the U.S. , the highest-earning movie premiere this year .
 What we ’ re reading : This investigation from The Verge . Noam Scheiber , our labor and workplace reporter , writes that Casey Newton “ provides the most detailed picture yet of what life is like for the moderator charged with monitoring content on Facebook . The workload and traumatizing content add up to an even grimmer reality than you suspect . ”
 Cook : Chickpea stew with orzo and mustard green is colorful and complex . ( Our Five Weeknight Dishes newsletter ha more recommendation . )
 Listen : Jackie Mendoza ’ s “ Seahorse , ” from an album due April 26 , melt the edge of her vocal with echo , reverb and stereo panning , Jon Pareles writes .
 See : Here are nine show in New York City this spring .
 Watch : We recommend the best TV show and movie added to streaming service this month .
 Smarter Living : Frustrated at work ? Perhaps that “ blocked ” feeling can fuel a breakthrough . Frustrated people reject the status quo and search for new and improved method — a long a they feel committed to their team and have the support they need to pursue their idea . We found a case study at Pixar .
 We also have tip on how to fix some common household electrical problem .
 The Times published an obituary of Carmine Persico , a noted New York mobster , on Friday . In some circle , the bigger news wa the byline .
 “ Say it with me child : Selwyn Raab , ” the Times writer Dan Barry posted on Twitter .
 Mr. Raab , 84 , retired from The Times in 2000 , after decade of reporting on the Mafia . His signature 2005 book , “ Five Families , ” run roughly 800 page .
 Your Back Story writer gave Mr. Raab a call . In addition to project for the History Channel , he ’ s writing a pilot for a series based on “ Five Families ” and working with Netflix on a series about the 1986 Mafia Commission trial .
 Sadly , we didn ’ t have a photograph of him on hand .

 A sensational new book mine the Catholic Church ’ s sexual secret . Will right-wing homophobe exploit it ?
 By Frank Bruni
 Opinion Columnist
 Marveling at the mysterious sanctum that his new book explores , the French journalist Frédéric Martel writes that “ even in San Francisco ’ s Castro ” there aren ’ t “ quite a many gay . ”
 He ’ s talking about the Vatican . And he ’ s delivering a bombshell .
 Although the book ’ s publisher have kept it under tight wrap , I obtained a copy in advance of it release next Thursday . It will come out in eight language and 20 country , under the title “ Sodoma , ” a in Sodom , in Western Europe and “ In the Closet of the Vatican ” in the United States , Britain and Canada .
 It includes the claim that about 80 percent of the male Roman Catholic clergy member who work at the Vatican , around the pope , are gay . It contends that the more showily homophobic a Vatican official is , the more likely he belongs to that crowd , and that the higher up the chain of command you go , the more gay you find . And not all of them are celibate . Not by a long shot .
 I ’ m supposed to cheer , right ? I ’ m an openly gay man . I ’ m a sometime church critic . Hooray for the exposure of hypocrisy in high place and the affirmation that some of our tormentor have tortured motif . Thank heaven for the challenge to their moral authority . Let the sun in . Let the truth out .
 But I ’ m bothered and even a little scared . Whatever Martel ’ s intent , “ In the Closet of the Vatican ” may be le a constructive reckoning than a stockpile of ammunition for militant right-wing Catholics who already itch to conduct a witch hunt for gay priest , many of whom are exemplary — and chaste — servant of the church . Those same Catholics oppose sensible and necessary reform , and will point to the book ’ s revelation a proof that the church is already too permissive and ha lost it dignity and it way .

 Although Martel himself is openly gay , he sensationalizes gayness by devoting his inquiry to Catholic official who have had sex with men , not one who have had sex with woman . The promise of celibacy that priest make forbids all sexual partner , and what violates Catholic teaching isn ’ t just gay sex but sex outside marriage . In that context , Martel ’ s focus on homosexuality buy into the notion that it ’ s especially troubling and titillating .
 His tone doesn ’ t help . “ The world I am discovering , with it 50 shade of gay , is beyond comprehension , ” he writes . It will seem to some reader “ a fairy tale. ” He challenge the conventional wisdom that Pope Francis , who ha detractor all around him , is “ among the wolf , ” clarifying , “ It ’ s not quite true : he ’ s among the queens. ” Maybe it ’ s better in the original French , but this language is at once profoundly silly and deeply offensive .
 The sourcing of much of “ In the Closet of the Vatican ” is vague , and other Vatican expert told me that the 80 percent figure is neither knowable nor credible .
 “ It ’ s not a scientifically based accusation — it ’ s an ideologically based one , ” said the Rev . Thomas Reese , a senior analyst for Religion News Service who visit the Vatican frequently and ha written several highly regarded book about the Roman Catholic hierarchy . “ One of the problem is that Catholic bishop have never allowed any kind of research in this area . They don ’ t want to know how many gay priest there are. ” Independent study put the percentage of gay men among Catholic priest in the United States at 15 percent to 60 percent .
 In a telephone interview on Thursday , Martel stressed that the 80 percent isn ’ t his estimate but that of a former priest at the Vatican whom he quote by name in the book . But he present that quotation without sufficient skepticism and , in his own word , writes , “ It ’ s a big majority . ”
 He say that “ In the Closet of the Vatican ” is informed by about 1,500 interview over four year and the contribution of score of researcher and other assistant . I covered the Vatican for The Times for nearly two year , and the book ha a richness of detail that ’ s persuasive . It ’ s going to be widely discussed and hotly debated .
 It depicts different sexual subculture , including clandestine meeting between Vatican official and young heterosexual Muslim men in Rome who work a prostitute . It name name , and while many belong to Vatican official and other priest who are dead or whose sexual identity have come under public scrutiny before , Martel also lavishes considerable energy on the suggestion that Francis ’ predecessor , Pope Benedict XVI , and other towering figure in the church are gay .
 Perhaps the most vivid of the double life under Martel ’ s gaze is that of Cardinal Alfonso López Trujillo of Colombia , who died a little over a decade ago . According to the book , he prowled the rank of seminarian and young priest for men to seduce and routinely hired male prostitute , sometimes beating them up after sex . All the while he promoted the church ’ s teaching that all gay men are “ objectively disordered ” and embraced it ban on priest who are believed to have “ deep-seated homosexual tendency , ” whether they act on them or not .
 Part of my concern about the book is the timing of it release , which coincides precisely with an unprecedented meeting at the Vatican about sexual abuse in the church . For the first time , the pope ha summoned the president of every Catholic bishop conference around the world to discus this topic alone . But the book “ is also bound to shift attention away from child abuse and onto gay priest in general , once again falsely conflating in people ’ s mind homosexuality and pedophilia , ” said the Rev . James Martin , a best-selling Jesuit author , in a recent tweet . He ’ s right .
 The book doesn ’ t equate them , and in fact make the different , important point that the church ’ s culture of secrecy — a culture created in part by gay priest ’ need to conceal who they are — work against the exposure of molester who are guilty of crime .
 As David Clohessy , a longtime advocate for survivor of sexual abuse by priest , said to me on the phone a few day ago : “ Many priest have a huge disincentive to report sexual misdeed by colleague . They know they ’ re vulnerable to being blackballed . It ’ s celibacy and the secretive , rigid , ancient all-male hierarchy that contributes to the cover-up and , therefore , more abuse. ” Abuse ha no sexual orientation , a fact made clear by many case of priest having sex with girl and adult woman , including nun , whose victimization by priest wa publicly acknowledged by Pope Francis for the first time early this month .
 But that ’ s a crucial subtlety that ’ s too easily lost in the thicket of exclamation point in “ In the Closet of the Vatican. ” And more people will read the racy headline about the book than read the book itself . What they may take away is this : Catholic priest are twisted character . And gay men are creature of stealth and agent of deception who band together in eccentric society with odd ritual .
 I asked Martel what his aim wa . “ I ’ m a journalist , ” he said . “ My only goal is to write story . I ’ m not a Catholic . I don ’ t have any motive of revenge . My concern is not that the church will be better or worse . I ’ m outside of the church . ”
 I asked him if he worried about homophobe weaponizing the book . If they read it correctly , he answered , they ’ ll realize that rooting out gay would mean ridding the church of some of their hero , who inveigh against homosexuality a a way of denying and camouflaging who they really are . The cardinal most accepting of gay , he said , are those who are probably straight .
 All else aside , the book speaks to the enormous and seemingly growing tension between a church that frequently vilifies and marginalizes gay men and a priesthood dense with them . “ This fact hang in the air a a giant , unsustainable paradox , ” wrote Andrew Sullivan , who is Catholic and gay , in an excellent cover story for New York magazine last month . It explains why so many gay men entered the priesthood , especially decade ago : They didn ’ t feel safe or comfortable in a society that ostracized them . Their sense of being outsider gave them a more spiritual bent and greater desire to help others in need .
 They weren ’ t pulling off some elaborate ruse or looking for the clerical equivalent of a bathhouse . They were trying , psychologically and emotionally , to survive . Many still are , and I fear that “ In the Closet of the Vatican ” won ’ t help .

 LOS ANGELES — Voting for the 91st Academy Awards end on Tuesday , with roughly 8,200 movie industry insider using a private website to mark their choice . Just what go through their mind when they point and click ?
 In a perfect world , each voter would approach the task with solemnity , taking time to watch all of the nominated film and putting aside bias to consider the degree of artistry onscreen .
 But Hollywood is no utopia .
 To a large degree , Oscar voting is about personal prejudice and petty grievance . ( Just read the anonymous voter column The Hollywood Reporter ha published in the past . ) It is about who ha the most pal in the voting pool , which remains 69 percent male and 84 percent white despite year of diversification effort . It also involves Hollywood ’ s changing business landscape — namely , whether Netflix should be embraced by the industry or kept out of the club for a long a possible , regardless of the quality of the film it serf up .
 So , a an experiment , I called 20 academy member ( none directly associated with any of this year ’ s nominee ) and asked for utter candor : How are you evaluating the eight candidate for best picture ?
 None would speak for attribution , but their answer said a lot about the Oscars in particular and Hollywood in general . ( High school with much , much more money , indeed . ) Below is an amalgamation of their comment .
 One vinegary older voter compared superhero film to “ the stuff that ooze out of dumpster behind fast-food restaurants. ” Then he confessed that he hadn ’ t yet seen “ Black Panther . ”
 Eek .
 But many of the people I called said they would place this comic-book blockbuster near the top of their ballot — citing it commanding performance , sumptuous production design and overall cultural importance . ( The academy us a complicated “ preferential ” voting system for best picture , in which nominee are ranked 1 through 8 , and the second- and third-place position can carry a much weight a first place . )
 The problem , at least for a few voter : “ Black Panther ” wa made by Marvel , which is owned by Disney , which ha turned every other studio into a box office also-ran . It will be even worse when Disney completes it takeover of 20th Century Fox . “ And now we ’ re also supposed to give Disney the Oscar for best picture ? ” one voter from a rival studio told me .
 Directed by Spike Lee , “ BlacKkKlansman ” drew praise for it originality and intellectual heft . As one person put it , “ BlacKkKlansman ” is the kind of film that hold up in the history book . There will be no “ Did we really vote for this ? ” regret in a couple of year . ( See : “ Shakespeare in Love . ” )
 On the downside , movie that win best picture usually connect with voter on an emotional level . At least in my little sample , “ BlacKkKlansman ” fell more into the “ deeply admire but don ’ t feel the need to watch it again ” zone .
 Lee could be the ceremony ’ s best hope for a viral moment , however . Some people relished the idea of his striding onto the Oscar stage and excoriating studio for sidelining minority . ( He ’ s never been one to mince word . ) “ Can you imagine ? ” said a voter who is a member of the academy ’ s writer branch . “ People would have to be hauled out on stretchers. ” ( Lee is also nominated for best director for the first time in his singular career . )
 This Queen biopic , directed by Bryan Singer ( at least until he wa fired for erratic behavior ) , rank a one of the more puzzling best picture contender in memory . ( And that ’ s saying something , considering that the talking-pig movie “ Babe ” wa a contender in 1996 . ) Voters used word like “ superficial ” and “ messy ” to describe the film , which received lukewarm review from critic and prompted an outcry for soft-pedaling gay plot point .
 Almost everyone admitted that “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” wa a guilty pleasure to watch , however , a Rami Malek turned in an Oscar-worthy performance a Freddie Mercury . ( All 20 people I contacted said Malek had their vote for best actor . )
 In a surprise — or not , given the way that Hollywood like to sweep problem under the rug — most voter said they would not hold Singer ’ s involvement against the film . The director ha long been trailed by accusation of sexual misconduct and new claim about sex with underage boy that surfaced in The Atlantic the day after Oscar nomination were announced . Singer denied wrongdoing and labeled the article “ a homophobic smear piece . ”
 Voters like being on the winning team . And this dark comedy set in the court of Queen Anne ( circa 1710 ) , while widely admired for it performance , script and costume , ha mostly been a loser at the big pre-Oscar ceremony . “ I love this nasty little movie , but I don ’ t want to throw my vote away , ” one person told me , adding that she wa waiting until the British Academy of Film and Television Arts award to make her decision . ( “ The Favourite ” won seven Baftas on Sunday , but lost the big prize to “ Roma . ” )
 Others seemed unsure whether “ The Favourite ” sent a positive message about woman ( Olivia Colman , Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz lead the cast ) or ultimately reinforces a “ Mean Girls ” stereotype ( they scheme , double-cross and manipulate ) .
 Nobody thought this period segregation comedy wa perfect . Could we please have a touch of nuance ? And that fried-chicken scene make everyone cringe . But “ Green Book ” tugged hard on a lot of voter heartstrings . One producer in his late 60 said the movie ’ s feel-good ending made him “ absolutely melt . ”
 Peter Farrelly , who directed “ Green Book ” and wa one of it writer , ha also proved to be an effective campaigner , a couple of voter noted , with his self-effacing speech at the Producers Guild Awards in January a Exhibit A . “ When you make ‘ Dumb and Dumber , ’ you never expect to get an award , ” Farrelly said , referring to one of his early film . “ I ’ m damn thankful . ”
 One voter , a studio executive in his 50 , admitted that his support for “ Green Book ” wa rooted in rage . He said he wa tired of being told what movie to like and not like . ( Much of the public debate about “ Green Book ” ha turned on it handling of racial issue , which some see a woefully retrograde and borderline bigoted . )
 Directed by Alfonso Cuarón and distributed by Netflix , “ Roma ” seems to be prompting a crisis of conscience .
 Do we vote for “ Roma ” because we think it ’ s the best ? Or do we withhold our support — regardless of the film ’ s artistic merit — because we see Netflix a a threat to moviegoing ? Although the company pushed “ Roma ” into about 250 independent theater in the United States , on par with many foreign-language release , the streaming giant mostly bypass cinema . There are voter in both camp . A couple of those in the anti-Netflix group told me that they would vote for Cuarón for best director a a way to assuage their guilt .
 The chief complaint about “ Roma ” involved it leisurely pace . One voter in the acting branch described the period black-and-white film a important but boring .
 It ’ s a long , bumpy road to the Oscars . And this blockbuster remake — a front-runner for best picture late last year — went kerplop somewhere along the way .
 Some voter said they lost their zeal for “ A Star Is Born ” after the film converted only one of it five Golden Globe nomination into a win ( best song ) . Others faulted Lady Gaga , who play the main role , for giving speech on the award trail ( the Globes , National Board of Review ) that struck them a cloying . A few older voter said they had gone back to watch the 1954 version of “ A Star Is Born , ” with Judy Garland , and come away with the belief that the current version wasn ’ t a good , especially in it second hour .
 “ The new one is a masterpiece — for 40 minute , ” one producer told me .
 Only one person said he would vote for “ Vice , ” a comedic biopic about Dick Cheney that wa directed and written by Adam McKay . “ I ’ m pal with one of the producer , so I feel like I have to , ” the person explained in a less-than-ringing endorsement .
 Others gushed about the performance in “ Vice ” ( especially Christian Bale ’ s in the title role and Amy Adams ’ s a Lynne Cheney ) but complained that Mr. McKay ’ s film , a a whole , wa a shade too impressed with it own cleverness and visual gimmick .
 The # OscarsSoWhite outcry from 2015 and 2016 also seems to loom over “ Vice. ” An organization filled with older white dude give best picture of the year to a movie about an old white dude ? “ We ’ d get crucified , ” one voter said .

 Homer ’ s Muse still sings .
 His epic tale follows the wily warrior Odysseus a he twist and turn his way back home to the shore of Ithaca after fighting a 10-year war at Troy . As reader everywhere know , the story ’ s theme of homecoming and hospitality , hubris and humility , suffering and survival continue to resonate across the century .
 Three recent book show that much remains to be said and discovered about the epic and it relationship to our life today . In 2017 , the first English translation of the “ Odyssey ” by a woman , the British classicist Emily Wilson , wa published to much acclaim , replacing older translation on some high school and college syllabus . The same year , Daniel Mendelsohn ’ s memoir , “ An Odyssey : A Father , A Son , and an Epic , ” recounted what happened when his 81-year old father decided to sit in on the author ’ s seminar on the “ Odyssey ” at Bard College . And in the spring of 2018 , Madeline Miller released “ Circe , ” a novel written from the enchantress ’ s perspective that expands her story both before and after her affair with Odysseus .
 Below , five lesson idea that draw on Times resource to help student navigate the wine-dark sea and discover how the “ Odyssey ” might speak to their own life and the world around them .
 _________
 1 . The Hero ’ s Journey
 Daniel Mendelsohn explains in his memoir that the word “ odyssey ” ha three meaning : “ voyage , ” “ journey , ” and “ travel. ” As an epic poem , the ” Odyssey ” further prepares u for a long narrative told on a grand scale of time and place , featuring a larger-than-life protagonist who is also Western civilization ’ s oldest hero . Odysseus , whose very name echo “ odyssey , ” is often translated to mean “ son of pain. ” Taken together the man and his journey seem fated for hardship .
 At a time when more than 65 million people around the world are officially displaced from their home by conflict , violence and persecution — the highest figure recorded by the United Nations since World War II — The Times ha chronicled many real-life odyssey in report of those journey . Invite student to read article like “ What Refugees Face on the World ’ s Deadliest Migration Route ” and “ Desperate Crossing ” to learn more , and to find link to theme and idea in the “ Odyssey. ” ( For more on teaching with this material , you might also consider some of the question and activity suggested in this Learning Network lesson plan . )
 But epic journey have also been fodder for comedy . Examples include the cartoonist Roz Chast ’ s take on the hero ’ s journey , Brian Gordon ’ s modern take on the Sirens , Lapham ’ s Quarterly Odyssey Game ( tagline : “ lose year , gain strength , return to wife ” ) and the doughnut-fueled “ Lemon of Troy ” episode of “ The Simpsons ” ( Season 6 , Episode 24 ) , featuring America ’ s favorite cartoon dad .
 The archetypal hero ’ s journey take many form and is particularly accessible for student through film . Have them read Times review of a favorite superhero film , like “ Black Panther , ” “ Wonder Woman ” or “ Iron Man , ” then write their own review explaining how the hero develops . They can do this either using the stage of Joseph Campbell ’ s hero cycle , or compare the journey of their chosen protagonist to Odysseus ’ journey .
 While any Marvel or DC Comics hero should suffice , student can also look to animated film such a “ The Incredibles ” and “ Wall-E , ” drama like “ The Natural , ” “ Glory , ” “ A Better Life , ” or classic comedy like “ Coming to America , ” “ Goonies , ” “ Back to the Future ” or even “ Some Like It Hot . ”
 2 . On Xenia
 Xenia is the Greek concept of hospitality . In the “ Odyssey , ” it is both a civic responsibility — serving the weary traveler who landed on the shore of one ’ s front door — and a spiritual duty , for it would always be entirely possible that the weary traveler could end up being a god in disguise .
 The Learning Network run an annual Connections Contest , in which student are invited to link anything they ’ re studying in school with something in the news . This year , one of the winner , Alex Iyer , a student from San Antonio , linked Homer ’ s “ Odyssey ” with the Times piece , “ As Rich Nations Close the Door on Refugees , Uganda Welcomes Them ” and talked about the role of xenia in both . Here is his essay :
 In literature , we learned that in Homer ’ s epic poem “ The Odyssey , ” Homer us the tribulation of the hero Odysseus to illustrate the Ancient Grecian custom of xenia . This custom focused on extending hospitality to those who found themselves far from home . As Odysseus navigates the treacherous path back to his own home , he encounter both morally upstanding and malevolent individual . They range from a charitable princess who offer food and clothing , to an evil Cyclops who attempt to murder the hero and his fellow men . In class , we agreed that Homer employ these contrasting character to exemplify not only proper , but also poor form of xenia .
 For the people of it time , the “ Odyssey ” cemented the idea that xenia wa fundamental for good character ; resulting in hospitality becoming engrained in the fabric of Ancient Grecian society . I saw a parallel to this in a New York Times article called “ As Rich Nations Close the Door on Refugees , Uganda Welcomes Them ” published on October 28 , 2018 . Similar to the prevalent custom of xenia in Ancient Greece , Uganda ha made hosting refugee a national policy . The country is now occupied by up to 1.25 million refugee , many of whom are fleeing the violent unrest of South Sudan .
 The xenia of Homeric time implied a mutually beneficial relationship between host and guest . We see this in Uganda , where villager share land with South Sudanese refugee . Grateful for this generosity , the refugee gladly help out with farming , carpentry , and even translation . Many Ugandans remember when they themselves had to look to Sudan for sanctuary . During the murderous rampage of Idi Amin and Joseph Kony , the Sudanese provided critical support to Ugandan refugee . These memory are motivating modern-day Ugandans to assist refugee , bringing the world a little closer to what xenia strived for over 2,000 year ago .
 Uganda and South Sudan are by no mean wealthy utopia . However , xenia wa never about the rich blindly giving to the poor . It aspired to foster symbiotic relationship of openness and inclusivity that would endure through time . It ’ s interesting that a quaint Greek ideal from thousand of year ago would find a practical application in Uganda . When Amos Chandiga wa asked why he lent two acre of his own land to refugee , he simply responded “ They asked me , and I gave it to them. ” He then patted his chest and said “ It come from here , in my heart. ” Perhaps this can serve a a lesson to Americans , a we grapple with modernizing our own asylum policy . Teaching u that , whether rich or poor , open border give way to open heart .
 You might challenge student to find more article in The Times that relate to xenia , the spirit behind welcoming the stranger — piece like “ Refugees Encounter a Foreign Word : Welcome , ” “ Love Thy Stranger As Thyself , ” “ A Lesson on Immigration From Pablo Neruda , ” “ Texas Pulls Up the Welcome Mat ” and “ Where Companies Welcome Refugees . ”
 And since school function a student ’ September-through-June “ home , ” they might then work with their counselor and student government to develop a welcoming committee , mission statement , and a set of resource that would have them sharing their hospitality to all those who make their way to the shore of the school , whether incoming freshman , transfer student , parent at an open house , or athlete visiting the school for a sporting event or competition . They may also work to propose program and extracurricular activity to ensure that student from diverse background have a welcome place at the school .
 3 . Epic Music Playlists
 The British author and screenwriter Nick Hornby explained the art of the mixtape his 1995 novel `` High Fidelity , ” which wa later adapted into film . His protagonist , Rob Flemings , explains :
 To me , making a tape is like writing a letter — there ’ s a lot of erasing and rethinking and starting again . A good compilation tape , like breaking up , is hard to do . You ’ ve got to kick off with a corker , to hold the attention … and then you ’ ve got to up it a notch , or cool it a notch … and you can ’ t have two track by the same artist side by side , unless you ’ ve done the whole thing in pair and … oh , there are load of rule .
 In the digital age , we still use the analog concept of a “ mixtape '' to talk about digital playlist or a compilation of related song . ( For example , consider the “ Hamilton Mixtape. ” ) Many of the playlist streamed on Pandora , Spotify and Apple Music are curated by algorithm based on listener data . That said , these service and others like Mixcloud and SoundCloud also celebrate human curation .
 The Times ha covered many notable playlist . A Vows column explored how song texted between a Hollywood couple became the Spotify “ mixtape ” for their Palm Springs wedding ; the Food section wrote about a musician who curated a soundscape for a restaurant ; Politics covered a presidential playlist ; and the Arts section featured the playlist one nonfiction writer created to accompany his book on hip-hop . ( Meanwhile , this piece in The Guardian cover the playlist that fiction writer like Stephen King create that are inspired by their book ’ character or theme . )
 The New York Times Music section share weekly playlist of notable new music and video , and they maintain a Spotify profile with playlist related to their criticism and reporting . The Learning Network ha even asked student to share their favorite playlist in the past .
 Inspired by these , we created a playlist for the “ Odyssey , ” which focus on allusion or retellings of Homer ’ s epic poem .
 See what you think , then tell u : What playlist might you make ? Your track can be informed by a character ’ s point of view : How would Telemachus ’ playlist differ from Athena ’ s ? Would Calypso ’ s playlist sound anything like Penelope ’ s ? Students might also create a playlist that address a theme like courage or deception , or design one that mirror the plot in some way , a doe a movie soundtrack . Whatever song you think will capture a unique musical point-of-view of Homer ’ s epic tale , we invite you to share them a a comment on this lesson , or by tagging u on Twitter @ NYTimesLearning .
 Finally , you might check out the Learning Network lesson plan “ Nine Teaching Ideas for Using Music to Inspire Student Writing ” to find even more idea for creating playlist related to topic you are studying in class .
 4 . Here Be Monsters
 Monsters are here , there and everywhere in film and literature . Many Times article have explored monster a metaphor . Film Critics have written about what movie monster teach u about our culture , childhood or , most recently , how racism ise the monster in director Jordan Peele ’ s award-winning film “ Get Out . ”
 Literary and historical monster are also rich source for discussion . During Odysseus ’ journey he encounter a wide range of supernatural creature , including the Sirens , Cyclops and the Lotus Eaters . He is caught between the famous Scylla and Charybdis and , at Circe ’ s behest , visit the Underworld . Many of these place and character can be read a metaphor for large challenge we face in life .
 The New York-based nonprofit organization Artolution recently asked student , “ What would creature in a world without violence look like ? ” Their short film show elementary student imagining and creating peaceful creature . We ’ d like to suggest a Homeric riff on this idea . Ask student , “ What type of monster would a school-aged Odysseus encounter if he were to spend three year in your middle school or four year in your high school ? ” Students can draw or use a free monster-making app like this one to create their creature . You might also share Andrew Bell ’ s ‘ Creatures in My Head ’ website for inspiration . Artwork should be accompanied by a creative narrative or poem about their monster and how it wa inspired by “ The Odyssey . ”
 5 . Lasting Legacies
 It is a minor character in the “ Odyssey ” who develops one of it most vital theme — the importance of one ’ s legacy .
 Elpenor , one of Odysseus ’ men , suffers an unremarkable death , meeting his demise when he fall from a rooftop in a drunken stupor . His story becomes poignant when he meet his leader in the Underworld , and begs to be properly buried and remembered . He pleads :
 Don ’ t sail off
 and desert me , left behind unwept …
 No , burn me in full armor , all my harness ,
 heap my mound by churning gray surf —
 a man whose luck ran out —
 so even men to come will learn my story ( 11.79 - 85 ) .
 Elpenor ’ s desire for his story to outlive him highlight the human desire to achieve some mark of the immortality reserved for the god . At The Times , a team of obituary writer doe the important work of summing up those legacy , both for the famous and for those le well-known whose life nonetheless “ put a wrinkle in the social fabric. ” The 2016 documentary “ Obit ” follows that team , a you can see in the film ’ s trailer , embedded above . In it , Margalit Fox , one of the team , suggests that “ obit have next to nothing to do with death and in fact absolutely everything to do with the life . ”
 While Benjamin Franklin and others did write their own epitaph , student need not imagine their own death in order to ponder the legacy they would like to leave behind . Students can read a selection of Times tribute that commemorate those who have made a lasting impression on the world . Recent tribute include reflection on Aretha Franklin , John McCain , Stan Mikita , and Mac Miller , a well a a collection of tribute The Times put together called “ Overlooked ” that celebrate remarkable people , mostly woman , who did not receive a Times obituary when they died .
 Students can jigsaw those we suggested or choose someone who interest them . In group , student might then use these learning experience organizer to think about what make a life well lived . ( Organizers for “ cartoonist , ” “ framer ” or “ lawyer ” work nicely here . ) After this process student can brainstorm their life goal for school using the WOOP ( Wish-Outcome-Obstacle-Plan ) goal-writing method . The “ Hidden Brain ” podcast and related book explain the science behind the method .
 Have student imagine that , 25 year after their graduation , they have been chosen to receive the distinguished alumnus or alumna award for their class . What will the nominating committee say about them ? How will they describe what they have achieved and the legacy it will leave for their chosen field ? Or , if student would rather write about someone else , have them reflect on the legacy of someone they know personally , such a a friend , parent or mentor .
 Let student have fun and focus on making meaning of a life well lived for whatever legacy they choose to write . If they would like to muse about their own life , invite them to contribute comment to a recent Learning Network Student Opinion question , What Legacy Do You Want to Leave Behind ? They could also consider making a mixed medium collage about their own or someone else ’ s legacy , a suggested in this lesson plan by the artist and teacher Clara Lieu .

 ( Want to get this briefing by email ? Here ’ s the sign-up . )
 Good morning .
 A covert U.S. effort to undermine Iran , Spain ’ s government teeter and suspicious transfer to a Bulgarian bank . Here ’ s the latest :
 The Trump administration ha accelerated effort to impair Iran ’ s missile and rocket a part of an expanding campaign to isolate the country , according to current and former official .
 The effort , initiated under former President George W. Bush and then eased under President Barack Obama , covertly slip faulty part and material into Iran ’ s aerospace supply chain . The Trump administration maintains that the country ’ s space program is merely a cover for developing powerful ballistic missile that could deliver nuclear warhead .
 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo , who is in Warsaw this week for an international meeting focused on Iran , is expected to push European and Arab country to expand economic sanction against Tehran .
 Accused of spying : A former U.S. Air Force counterintelligence agent wa charged with espionage after she defected to Iran to help the country ’ s elite Revolutionary Guards target her former American colleague .
 An attack in Iran : A suicide bomber killed 27 Islamic Revolutionary Guards in one of the deadliest attack in Iran in year , for which the paramilitary force quickly blamed the U.S .
 The fragile minority government of Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez , one of the few Socialist leader left standing in Europe , could go down after Parliament rejected his budget in a fight over the restive northeastern region of Catalonia . New national election look almost certain before the summer .
 What happened : Mr. Sánchez wa hoping to pas a national budget to address inequality that have come with Spain ’ s economic recovery . But Catalan lawmaker , infuriated that Mr. Sánchez had rejected holding a second referendum on Catalan independence after the first , in 2017 , wa ruled unconstitutional , pulled their support . It wa the first defeat for a Spanish government ’ s budget since 1995 .
 What ’ s next ? With Spain ’ s two-party system becoming more of a mélange of party and the Catalan question superheating , new election could be politically unsettling and unpredictable . Recent poll suggest enough vote for a right-wing coalition government , which would be expected to take a much harder line on Catalonia . But Mr. Sánchez ’ s survival instinct can ’ t be counted out .
 Eyad A. allegedly operated a checkpoint on the outskirt of Damascus where , typically , 100 people were arrested every day . They were taken to a prison run by Anwar R. , a high-ranking Syrian intelligence officer who directed “ the use of systematic and brutal torture ” on inmate .
 Those are the accusation against two men arrested in Germany . They were charged with crime against humanity in Syria dating to between 2011 and 2012 , and a third suspect wa detained in France . Officials declined to give their full name .
 Evidence : French and German prosecutor working together on the case interviewed survivor of torture in a Syrian detention center . They also have access to an archive assembled by a nonprofit organization of hundred of thousand of document detailing the activity of the Syrian government .
 Ahead : A former war crime prosecutor told u that Anwar R. “ is the most serious regime perpetrator detained so far by some distance. ” This case could portend more like it , and if it come to trial , it would be a milestone in holding the regime of President Bashar al-Assad accountable for horror in Syria ’ s eight-year civil war .
 Tipped off by the U.S. , the Bulgarian authority froze the account of a small bank that they did not name and said they were investigating other institution after finding suspicious money transfer from Venezuela ’ s oil company , the state-run Petróleos de Venezuela , or Pdvsa .
 The money : Sent 6,000 mile to Bulgaria , much of the Pdvsa fund then vanished to account in other country for listed purpose that the authority said were bogus . A Bulgarian official said of the amount involved , “ We can ’ t be exact , but million of euro . ”
 In Venezuela : Once a crux of global oil production , Pdvsa is now a wheezing giant suspected of overwhelming corruption . In the past five year , Venezuela ’ s crude oil production ha about halved , and opposition politician contend that a much a $ 30 billion of the company ’ s money ha gone missing in recent year .
 Recent U.S. sanction could inflict a further beating , and they are hurting already strapped Venezuelans . The battle over who is the legitimate leader of Venezuela now revolves around a single shipment of humanitarian aid that the government of President Nicolás Maduro is blocking from Colombia . The opposition , led by Juan Guaidó , seems unsure how to respond .
 Belgium : A national strike over pay and working condition led to the cancellation of all flight and halted public transport .
 Russia investigation : Paul Manafort , President Trump ’ s former campaign chairman , repeatedly lied to prosecutor after he agreed to cooperate with the special counsel , a federal judge ruled .
 A black panther : Scientists spotted the rare animal in Africa , the first such sighting in almost 100 year .
 Airbus : Production of it mammoth A380 passenger jet will cease . The double-decker engineering marvel couldn ’ t keep up with shift in the way people fly , the European aircraft maker said .
 U.S. border deal : President Trump inched toward embracing a bipartisan border deal that fell far short of his demand for funding for a wall . Our Washington correspondent write that it is a “ punishing defeat ” for Mr. Trump , whose aide have tried to tamp down criticism on the right .
 Yemen : The U.S. House voted to end military support for Saudi Arabia ’ s war in Yemen , a rare move to limit presidential war power that turn up pressure on the Senate to do the same .
 France : A private Facebook group that included many male journalist wa behind wave of online humiliation aimed at woman in journalism .
 Apple : A former senior lawyer at the tech giant who oversaw it insider trading policy wa himself accused of insider trading . Separately , the company is under pressure , along with Google , to pull an app in Saudi Arabia that allows men to track female relative .
 China : A film by the prominent director Zhang Yimou that is set during the Cultural Revolution wa abruptly withdrawn from the Berlin Film Festival for “ technical reason ” — a term often used a a euphemism for Chinese government censorship .
 Indonesia : An Instagram account that featured a comic strip with gay Muslim character disappeared day after Indonesian official derided it a pornographic and threatened to block the entire social medium platform — underscoring the rise of the country ’ s hard-line Islamic movement .
 Opportunity : NASA ’ s Mars rover is dead after exploring the planet ’ s red plain for 14 year . It wa the longest-lived roving robot ever sent to another planet .

 LOS ANGELES — Cocaine ha disrupted countless Hollywood production , and that wa the case not long ago on the set of Showtime ’ s new comedy “ Black Monday. ” But this time , it wa it absence , not it presence , that wa the problem .
 “ I need my coke , sorry , ” Regina Hall said , an oversight that brought an elaborate wedding scene to a halt . Clad in a sequined denim bridesmaid dress and an enormous pink hair bow , Hall chatted with her co-star Don Cheadle a extra milled about and someone ran to fetch her nose candy ( actually a mix of comparatively benign powder like B-vitamins and starch ) . At a cluster of monitor , the showrunners Jordan Cahan and David Caspe pondered whether key bump were wedding-appropriate , even in the baroquely dissipated world of 1980s Wall Street .
 “ Maybe just a cigarette ? ” Cahan said , and soon a production assistant wa handing Hall a fake cigarette instead of a vial of fake cocaine .
 These are the sort of behind-the-scenes decision that arise on “ Black Monday , ” an outrageous new comedy that began Sunday on Showtime , about a ragtag bunch of trader running a long con on the street ’ s blue-blood establishment . ( Think “ Bad News Bears ” meet “ Trading Places , ” with lifestyle cue borrowed from “ The Wolf of Wall Street . ” )
 [ Read our TV critic ’ s review of “ Black Monday . ” ]
 Cheadle is Maurice “ Mo ” Monroe , a stock market schemer overseeing the Jammer Group , an underdog firm that includes Hall ’ s Dawn Towner , the head trader , and Blair Pfaff ( Andrew Rannells ) , a wide-eyed Wharton grad getting a quick and very dirty education in the ethic of high-level finance . ( Lesson 1 : There aren ’ t any . )
 The degenerate staff is rounded out by Horatio Sanz , Yassir Lester and Paul Scheer , whose puffed-up schlub of a trader manifest multiple flavor of self-hatred .
 The multicultural makeup is the most obvious early sign that “ Black Monday , ” which is executive produced by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg ( “ Superbad ” “ The Disaster Artist ” ) , is up to more than just filthy joke . ( Though those are definitely core to the enterprise . )
 In positioning a firm whose racial diversity “ would not have been allowed at that time , ” Cheadle said , against cartoonish Wall Street Brahmins — Ken Marino play a pair of vapid twin who are supposed to be the Lehman Brothers — the show aim to satirize the monotone culture of high finance and , by extension , American hall of power .
 “ We joke that the show ’ s about how far we haven ’ t come , ” Caspe said .
 “ Black Monday ” is also a tightly plotted murder mystery . The show , which style itself a a gonzo secret history of the run-up to the 1987 stock market crash of the title , open with a body plummeting from a Wall Street skyscraper onto Mo ’ s “ Limbo ” ( a Lamborghini that ha been converted into a limousine ) . The first season reveals the story of both crash : the identity of that body a well a what caused the cataclysmic market plunge .
 And while the show ’ s dialogue , especially , is defined by broad vulgarity , beneath that surface is an experiment in skewering a benighted milieu without indulging in the very thing that made it appalling .
 “ It ’ s a full package that I ’ ve never quite seen , where there ’ s that many facet that can all be used together , ” Goldberg said . “ But it ’ s extremely funny . ”
 Whatever it facet , “ Black Monday ” will live or die on the strength of it joke , which range from profanely inventive à la “ Veep ” to shock-jock puerile . ( Aficionados of gleefully crass Apatowian one-liner will be delighted ; others might be taxed . Reviews have been mixed . )
 The show ’ s tireless commitment to the laugh feel almost radical , given prestige TV ’ s current preference for emotionally trenchant comedy . Showtime ’ s other half-hour show include “ SMILF , ” about a struggling single mom , and “ Kidding , ” about a grieving kid TV host .
 “ It ’ s been a lot of dramedies , ” said Gary Levine , a Showtime president of entertainment . “ We were anxious to have that harder comedy . ”
 Cheadle said : “ These guy are joke whore — they ’ re always trying to get in a many a they can . ”
 Caspe is best known for creating the cult favorite sitcom “ Happy Endings ” — his wife Casey Wilson , one of the star of that show , also star in “ Black Monday. ” His father and grandfather were commodity trader , and “ Black Monday ” is inspired by the story of debauchery he heard growing up .
 “ My dad told me about leaving work and passing this wave of prostitute on their way in a he wa walking out , ” Caspe said . “ Guys betting $ 10,000 on which person across the office is going to go to the bathroom first — just crazy , crazy [ expletive ] . ”
 Showtime passed on the first version of the show he developed with Cahan ( “ Champaign ILL ” ) , a friend from childhood . ( “ The timing wa wrong , ” Levine said , noting that “ The Wolf of Wall Street ” had just come out and Showtime had recently debuted the pulpy hedge fund drama “ Billions . ” )
 So Caspe submitted “ Black Monday ” a a writing sample for another job , where it caught Goldberg ’ s eye . “ I said [ expletive ] that , let ’ s make this , ” Goldberg recalled .
 Backed by the powerhouse producer Rogen and Goldberg , the project wa revived at Showtime and pitched to Cheadle , who , won over by the story and mash-up of genre , signed on a star and executive producer .
 “ It ’ s outrageous and satirical and at time poignant — we ’ re walking a line , clearly , and that ’ s always risky , ” he said during a break from shooting . “ But , ultimately , if you ’ re going to try to do something , let ’ s try to do it in a new way . ”
 Most of the poignancy , at least in the early episode , come from Hall ’ s character ’ s struggle to be taken seriously both at her job , where she ’ s surrounded by misogynist , and at home , where her husband ( Kadeem Hardison ) and parent want her to stop working and start having baby .
 The unapologetically wacky “ Black Monday ” is a tonal swerve from Hall ’ s recent film like the police brutality drama “ The Hate U Give ” and last summer ’ s low-fi charmer “ Support the Girls ” — her performance in the latter is a wild-card contender for an Oscar nomination . But Hall brings a welcome ballast to the series a the modern ’ 80 woman Dawn , patterned after her mother .
 “ Everything I ’ m doing , I remember seeing my mom do in the ’ 80 , ” she said on the set , bow flapping a she emphasized her point . “ They put on pantyhose every day and they did the damn thing . ”
 She caught her reflection in a nearby mirror . “ I forget I have this [ expletive ] bow on , ” she sighed . “ This is not one of Dawn ’ s best outfit , this bridesmaid debacle . ”
 Wardrobe is only one aspect of the show ’ s shameless wallowing in the aesthetic lowlights of 1980s chic , one that some actor found more rewarding than others . “ I look like James Spader in “ Baby Boom , ” and it ’ s everything I wanted a a kid , ” said Rannells , whose callow yuppie Blair is caught between his spoiled fiancée ( Wilson ) and Mo .
 Other example include the aforementioned Limbo , the obligatory brick-size cellphone and ample interior design indulgence , like Dawn ’ s mauve and black lacquer dream of an apartment .
 The writer treat low-hanging ’ 80 fruit like piñatas , stuffing the script with broad joke about designer jean , Michael Milken-era finance and the wonder of primitive technology . In one episode a screenwriter shadow Mo a research for a film he ’ s working on with Oliver Stone . In another , the trader marvel at the realism of Nintendo ’ s Duck Hunt a they snort white line off the gray plastic gun .
 Indeed , the guiding philosophy seems to be when in doubt , add more cocaine , even down to the cinematography . Rogen and Goldberg directed the pilot episode , establishing a frenetic visual grammar designed to “ feel like you ’ re in a room with a lot of people on cocaine , and trying to keep up with what they ’ re talking about , ” Rogen said .
 The show wa shot largely on anamorphic 1980s movie lens , Rogen said , to channel the look and feel of comedy from the decade . ( In one visual Easter egg , the firm ’ s trading floor includes a replica of the Frozen Concentrated Orange Juice flip dot display from the end of “ Trading Places. ” ) Showtime itself even got into the act , and will air “ Black Monday ” with vintage intro bumper .
 “ It ’ s a thrilling dynamic when the marketing people are blowing your mind instead of making you want to kill yourself , ” Goldberg said .
 Others parallel were trickier , reflecting that whatever the object of it satire , “ Black Monday ” will be judged by more modern sensitivity .
 The series is most interesting when it deal with the day-to-day marginalization of it outsider : Mo a an African-American CEO ; Dawn a an underestimated woman ; other character a closeted gay in a time of shameless homophobia . But a seen in other depiction of the time , like the relentlessly hard-R “ Wolf of Wall Street , ” in practice the difference between parodying a world and indulging in it abuse can be slim to the point of meaninglessness .
 “ It wa a really difficult line to draw , because you want the era to feel authentic , but the last thing you want to do is offend the people the show is about , ” Cahan said .
 So while the pervy trader of “ Black Monday ” ob over strip bar , no actual female nudity appears in the series . A gay slur is uttered early in the season , but it ’ s used to identify a villain and also spark a character ’ s growing acceptance of his sexuality .
 “ I won ’ t know if we walked the line correctly until we see some response to the show , ” Caspe said . “ Which is terrifying . ”
 But how smoothly will the more serious stuff mesh with Limbo joke ? The creator take comfort from that previously referenced Oliver Stone movie — 1987 ’ s “ Wall Street , ” of course — which mined award and acclaim from ’ 80 excess . “ That ’ s an Oscar-winning drama and Gordon Gekko ha a robot butler , ” Caspe said .
 “ What wa nice about ’ 80 Wall Street is the world itself is so broad , ” he added , “ that we get to do pretty big comedy while still being totally within reality . ”
 An earlier version of this story described in error the car owned by Don Cheadle ’ s character in “ Black Monday. ” It is known a a “ Limbo , ” not a “ Lambo . ”

 The sergeant and I stared at each other for a moment a the office door shut . I ’ m certain the expression on my face mirrored the pale , shaken one I saw on his . Only second earlier , we both stood silent , hand clasped behind our back respectfully , a a noncommissioned officer stood inch from my face and threatened to end my career .
 As we left the office , the sergeant searched for something consolatory to say . His word , and any comfort I might have taken from them , fell flat . I sat , staring at my computer screen , trying to recall what task I had been working on . A few hour later , Lt. Meghan Kalliavas would stop by and explain : The noncommissioned officer wa the head of the unit ’ s Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention program . The evening before , there had been a report of a male-on-male sexual assault in our unit . In response , and apparently to demonstrate his competency in his assigned position , the noncommissioned officer had taken it upon himself to approach the person he considered inclined toward committing a similar offense in the future : me , the only openly gay soldier in my unit .
 I wa fortunate that Kalliavas , the officer in charge of the intelligence department where I worked , wa a woman with no tolerance for prejudice . Together we approached our unit ’ s leadership , where she insisted that the comment had stemmed from the representative ’ s own homophobic feeling and recommended that he be reprimanded and removed from his position a the unit ’ s sexual harassment watchdog . We never learned whether any action wa ever taken against him .
 This wasn ’ t the first time at the Second Battalion , 87th Infantry that I wa targeted because of my sexuality , and a part of me marveled that it could still make my hand shake and stomach clench . I told myself that I should have built a thicker skin at this point ; that in comparison to the life-or-death hardship of military life , these moment meant nothing . But by then it wa hard to ignore the anxiety I felt during required social activity — “ mandatory fun , ” a it ’ s called in the military — or the tension from my fellow soldier .
 The moment I decided to become a soldier and the moment I chose to live openly a a gay man occurred so closely in time that it ’ s hard to remember which came first . In early 2011 , I wa 19 and visiting my uncle , Senior Chief Petty Officer Brandon Parry , and his family on a naval base in Naples , Italy . It wa with his guidance that I enlisted a an intelligence analyst in the United States Army and with his encouragement that I came out , first to him and then to the rest of my family and friend .
 Before the end of May 2011 , just before I left for basic combat training , my uncle sent me to Chicago to meet his two best friend and fellow sailor , Mike Landry and Abraham Elizondo . It wa still four month before the repeal of “ don ’ t ask , don ’ t tell , ” a double-edged policy prohibiting asking any service member about his or her sexuality while enforcing a ban on openly gay service member . Mike and Abe were to mentor me on how to survive a a gay serviceman . Their lesson advocated a combination of caution and performance .
 They lived together , along with Mike ’ s partner , Larry Hall , in a condominium just off the Wilson stop on the Red Line . Each had something to say about my upcoming service , each offering a different pot of paint to camouflage me into the background of my fellow soldier . Abe — who had been a senior paralegal during his 20-year service — approached everything with a simple philosophy : Prove it . As long a gay soldier kept their mouth shut , the burden of proof fell on those making the accusation . Mike , a former chief warrant officer turned military housing director , alternated between agreeing with Abe and interjecting story about his experience : “ Yep , and he only called me a faggot once . One time , and I gave that little shit the boot . That ’ s what you ’ ve got to do . You can ’ t let anyone call you a fag . Because it ’ ll just get worse. ” Even Larry , a skateboarding tech guru , chimed in , reminding me that the repeal of “ don ’ t ask , don ’ t tell ” wasn ’ t far-off .
 For the next eight month , I all but ignored their advice . During basic training at Fort Jackson in South Carolina , I confessed to my bunkmate Aaron Frick — a tall white Coloradan who converted to Hinduism sometime before enlisting — that the picture of the guy in my locker wasn ’ t of a friend . Frick wasn ’ t terribly surprised by this news . He would go on to be my roommate and best friend during our next stage of training . On Sept. 20 , 2011 , “ don ’ t ask , don ’ t tell ” wa repealed , and I immediately stopped concealing my sexuality . I openly used the word “ boyfriend ” when describing my partner , never worrying that any of my superior or classmate cared . I wa surrounded by driven woman and men focused on their career and on forging close relationship with their peer . I wondered at how thing could have changed so drastically from the time Mike and Abe had served .
 The second week after I arrived at Fort Drum , N.Y. — my first and only duty station with the Army — I found death threat slipped under the door of my barrack room . I noticed the color first . Pink , blue and yellow ; strangely happy color at odds with the word written on them . Some were simple : slur and epithet written in thick black Sharpie , pressed so hard into the paper that it bled through . “ Faggot ” and “ queer fag , ” the note read . A couple were more elaborate : detailed description of what might happen to me if I wa caught alone , and proclamation about the wrongness of gay in the military .
 I read the most detailed description over again , trying to explain them away a something other than what they were . Maybe they were a joke , or meant for someone else . I reached for my phone and then stopped . If I reported these and they were only a joke , then I would become “ that guy. ” Taking ridicule — smiling at the most vile and offensive slight with the understanding that they were nothing more than joke — is the most important social capital in the military . Was I willing to risk losing that capital before I had the chance to earn it ? I tore the bright sticky note into confetti and tossed them into the trash .
 The military is built on a foundation of earning trust and proving yourself to your peer and superior a capable . Being new to a unit isn ’ t unlike being a new employee at any other job . People are cautious , even wary , until you ’ ve shown you can handle the work . Perhaps it didn ’ t help that I wa an intelligence analyst in an infantryman ’ s world — a support soldier in a combat soldier ’ s unit . But none of that had been mentioned in the note . My capability wasn ’ t in question , nor wa my duty position . It wasn ’ t my effectiveness or value to the unit that elicited these noxious note but something far removed from my control . Something that after September 2011 wa supposed to be meaningless .
 After a few month at Fort Drum , I discovered a group that convened for secret support meeting . No two people were similar — a woman who had been in the service nearly a long a I had been alive , a married father , an infantry soldier a rank below me . Each person identified a something other than heterosexual , but only privately . In their everyday life , they pretended to be straight . We met in different place — in barrack room and office after hour — but always in secret . Sometimes it wa to console or commiserate . Other time I think it wa to simply know that we weren ’ t alone .
 During these meeting I always talked about my anxiety over not knowing who had written those sticky note and if they were standing next to me in formation or would be the person I sat beside , alone , on my next 24-hour shift . The others revealed truth I considered much darker than my own : The woman spoke about the sexual assault she never reported during the time of “ don ’ t ask , don ’ t tell ” for fear that an investigation would unveil that she wa a lesbian ; the husband spoke about feeling trapped but fearing that revealing himself would cost him everything ; and the infantryman confessed that he drank himself to sleep because he could never claim what he wa aloud . At least I hadn ’ t had to endure any of their horror , I would think . Remembering this wa sometimes helpful — a if I were seeing thing with greater perspective , finding the silver lining . Other time it made me nearly sick with shame to compare my fear with theirs . But I never stopped going .
 I left the Army in December 2014 , but I still feel a if I am coming to term with my identity . There are moment when it feel wrong to claim my status a a veteran ; a if being gay made me le of a soldier and somehow invalidated my service . These moment of vulnerability bring me back to when one of my superior told me not to bring a date to the military ball ; to when I found “ Fag ” spelled out in the snow on my windshield with urine ; to all the time I avoided those who showed me compassion , for fear that it wa a trick and that they had been the one to slip the note beneath my door . Every memory evokes an emotion : rage that I had to serve with a constant sense of fear of my fellow soldier ; paralyzing sadness for those who endured abuse worse than I can know ; and , the worst , guilt over the service member — gay or straight or transgender — who died while serving in the military while my body is still whole .
 I don ’ t know if these feeling will ever go away . But it is when the guilt is most crippling that I remember my support group . That chance to share an unseen pain and know there were others like me struggling each day still help me wake up each morning , pull on my boot and go about my day .

 The nice man who brought sample of the banoffee macaron to me and other customer one recent morning began , a few moment later , to gently buff the door and window of a new , rose-gold prototype car with a soft cloth . I could see this because the car and I were sharing a room on West 14th Street . The car wa in the back and I wa in the middle , sitting at one of the cafe table near the stair to the second floor , where there is a bar shaped like a wheel and a restaurant with a menu devised by Gregory Marchand , the chef of the Frenchie restaurant in Paris and London .
 The employee in all of these room work for the Union Square Hospitality Group , which I suppose mean that Danny Meyer , the group ’ s founder and one of the world ’ s best-known restaurateur , is now also in the business of polishing automobile . The whole operation is called Intersect by Lexus , which give you a good idea who made the car and wa paying to keep it shiny and free of dust .
 Intersect by Lexus is one of those modern place where brand , instead of asking you to buy one of their product then and there , instead try to make you feel the kind of emotion about the brand that may lead to a sale later on .
 This is a job formerly performed by advertisement . In fact , Lexus used to publish a print magazine and mail it to it customer , back when that seemed like a good way to persuade people to have emotion about a car . Now we live in the age of the “ branded experience. ” A toilet-paper manufacturer will send you a wheeled toilet on demand . A mattress company will encourage you to sleep inside a roaming “ napmobile. ” Makers of a crunchy orange snack open restaurant , lasting just a few day , where chef put the crunchy orange snack into meatball , taco , cheesecake and everything else .
 You can not get Anne Burrell to sprinkle a Lexus over the top of your mac and cheese , however , and not just because the cheapest one cost $ 33,000 more than a bag of crunchy orange snack . Intersect by Lexus take a different approach , closer to that of A/D/O , a “ creative hub ” in Greenpoint , Brooklyn , owned by the car brand Mini . A/D/O offer temporary exhibition , talk , performance , work space for designer and a sun-filled , roomy Scandinavian cafe whose kitchen wa , for a time , overseen by the chef Fredrik Berselius and the restaurateur Claus Meyer . ( Mr. Berselius is no longer involved . )
 When I ate at the cafe , shortly after A/D/O opened , the food barely dented my consciousness , although I remember thinking that if I worked nearby I probably would drop in for lunch or a cortado . In the same way , if I find myself in the meatpacking district by day , I might join the Wi-Fi philosopher who occupy the spindle-backed chair downstairs at Intersect , just so I could get a maple-bacon scone , a recipe imported from Frenchie to Go on the Rue du Nil in Paris .
 On the other hand , I ’ d go well out of my way to eat upstairs at Intersect again . It ’ s not a restaurant in three dimension — the service , while skilled , is a bit anonymous , and the interior is a hodgepodge of expensive , subtle design and bric-a-brac that might have been ordered from a catalog . But the food is some of the most engaging I ’ ve come across in the past few month , and it will go away after the end of March , when Mr. Marchand ’ s menu will be replaced by one devised by another chef from somewhere else in the world , chosen by representative from Union Square Hospitality Group and Lexus . ( A formal review , with star , would be obsolete almost a soon a it wa published . )
 I ’ ve never made it to Frenchie or it branch in London . Many New York chef have , however , and working my way through Mr. Marchand ’ s dish at Intersect helped me understand what other restaurant around town have been trying to imitate : the charred leaf , the cooked grain , the gently swirling pattern that suggest the chef ha been plating food on a turntable .
 Grilled baby leek green angled out around a pile of barley topped with what looked like a deviled egg . It wa , in fact , a smoked and lemon-spiked yolk plopped in the center of some “ white ” made of Parmesan sabayon . Spice and crunch came from puffed barley dusted with piment d ’ Espelette . It wa just tricky enough , this dish . And I loved the way a caraway brioche , pickled mustard seed and cucumber completed the deli allusion begun by a foie gras terrine with layer of soft , smoky pastrami .
 There wa a very welcome spin on skate grenobloise in which the fish wa replaced by creamy white halibut under a golden bread-crumb crust ; sea bean extended the briny flavor of caper in the brown butter sauce . And if this all sound a bit cerebral , the big , pillowy , pan-seared gnocchi with fried sweetbread and veal-glazed mushroom proved that Mr. Marchand know the appeal of animal instinct .
 What to make of those few dish that did not come together — the pebble of cauliflower under a layer of seed and nut that looked a if it had spilled from a bird feeder , or the lukewarm chocolate mousse at the bottom of a deep bowl ? Was the problem Mr. Marchand ’ s recipe ? The way the Union Square Hospitality kitchen crew , led by Nickolas Martinez , had carried them out ? The local terroir ?
 Mr. Martinez and Dylan Shipsey , the general manager , say they want customer to feel a if they are walking into Frenchie in Paris . Intersect doe not have the premodern limestone wall and ceiling timber of the Rue du Nil , but Mr. Marchand tried to sprinkle some Right Bank pixie dust on West 14th Street by choosing the plate and bowl , consulting on flower arrangement and sharing his Spotify playlist .
 Maybe those thing help . But the dining room , by the design firm Wonderwall , mostly look like money to me , apart from the shelf half-filled with coffee-table book , black crow figurine and other eerily generic knickknack . At least somebody had the good sense to keep the car downstairs , by the restroom , before it wa rolled out last weekend to make room for another temporary exhibition . In what may not be a good sign for Lexus , nobody paid much attention to it when I wa there , but somebody wa always marveling about the toilet , the Japanese kind that seem to know exactly what you are going to do before you do .
 The chef-in-residence conceit is not unique to Intersect . On Mulberry Street , Chefs Club also turn it permanent kitchen crew over to somebody else ’ s menu ; a new restaurant in Houston , the Decatur Bar & Popup Factory , give it entire space to prospective restaurateur for three month at a time so they can test-drive their idea before going out on their own .
 The chef of Contra , in Manhattan , and other restaurant sometimes turn over the menu to friend of theirs for a night or two . The most ambitious experiment in this vein may be In Situ , the restaurant inside the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art that on any given day faithfully reproduces a dozen or so dish that are strongly identified with other restaurant around the world .
 To understand the appeal for chef of these pop-up and residency , think about the Instagram post , the email-address cache , the preview news item , even the occasional review they generate . For a few month ’ or even a few night ’ work , a restaurant can refresh it aura of newness and relevance . In an era that feed on novelty , chef who just keep plugging along can seem older than they really are .
 The event make the host restaurant look cooler , too . ( It ’ s been a while since Union Square Hospitality Group hired a chef who got menu analyst chattering the way Mr. Marchand doe . ) And of course , people who go to these dinner can boast about them on social medium . It ’ s a big , beautiful marketing ecosystem in which everybody from predator to bottom feeder get to believe they ’ re at the top of the food chain .

 Mariano Rivera will not be the only player elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame this week on his first try . Public ballot have shown overwhelming support for Roy Halladay , the former ace of the Toronto Blue Jays and the Philadelphia Phillies . If Halladay were here , he would surely acknowledge that Rivera , the sublime Yankees closer , helped nudge him over the Cooperstown border .
 Halladay died on Nov. 7 , 2017 , at age 40 when the small plane he wa piloting crashed into shallow water near Holiday , Fla . In one of his final interview , he enthusiastically recalled a tutorial with Rivera at the 2008 All-Star Game , and a tip that gave him his final burst of brilliance .
 “ I ’ d been watching Mariano a lot , and my cutter wa pretty good , but it wasn ’ t always consistent , ” Halladay said in March 2017 at a picnic table beneath palm tree at the Phillies ’ training complex in Clearwater , Fla. “ There were time where it would be really good and other time when it just wasn ’ t a effective . Mariano really helped me . ”
 I had chased Halladay for more than two year to set up this conversation . I needed his perspective for a book I wa writing on pitching — “ K : A History of Baseball in Ten Pitches , ” to be published this spring by Doubleday — and knew he would be a critical voice .
 As The New York Times ’ s Yankees beat writer for most of his Blue Jays tenure , I had marveled at Halladay — the way he stoically baited elite hitter into tentative swing and never seemed satisfied unless he had worked nine inning . He had just returned to the Phillies in 2017 a an instructor , advising minor leaguers on the mental side of the sport . Halladay had rebuilt his confidence and delivery early in his career , and he never stopped reinventing himself on the mound .
 With his cutter , Halladay suspected that the problem wa his thumb position . Rivera wa a legend by then , on his way to a record 652 career save , and his name became synonymous with the cutter , a pitch he had found by accident but had mastered like no other . He confirmed Halladay ’ s guess .
 “ Sure enough , ” Halladay said , “ he told me that one of the key for him wa making sure he wrapped his thumb under and got it on the opposite side of the ball . ”
 When Halladay threw his sinker , with his index and middle finger along the narrow seam , he placed his thumb directly under his index finger on the bottom of the ball . When he threw his cutter , which he held with his index and middle finger across the wide part of the seam , he always put his thumb in the same spot .
 Rivera showed Halladay his technique , bending his thumb at the knuckle and tucking it under the ball , so the nail wa even with the middle finger , not the index finger . This kept the thumb pad from blocking the ball ’ s spin a it left his hand , allowing the index and middle finger to pull through unimpeded and send it on it path , veering inside to a lefty hitter and away from a righty .
 I handed Halladay a ball , and he wrapped it in Rivera ’ s grip , holding his arm out straight .
 “ So now if you look at it from behind , you have all the ball sticking out on this side , ” he said , and from the pitcher ’ s perspective , you could see at least half the ball peeking out from the left side of the hand . The rest of the ball wa covered by Halladay ’ s finger .
 “ So now it ’ s overloaded . It almost ha to go that way , ” he said . “ When I got my thumb underneath the index finger , it wa still centered . But a soon a I get it moved over , then all of a sudden , it overload the ball on that side . ”
 Did it feel natural right away ?
 “ It took a little while , ” Halladay said , “ and it wa so awkward at time that when it wa really good , I traced my finger on the ball with a pen . I just took a black ballpoint pen and traced it , right where my finger placement wa , and I put it in my locker and just stored it and kept it with me . Well the next spring , I wa throwing it and it wasn ’ t working , I wasn ’ t getting result out of it . So I went back and picked up that ball and just grabbed it without looking at the mark . And sure enough , my thumb wa back to here , where it felt comfortable .
 “ So I put it back on that mark where it wa a little uncomfortable at first , but sure enough , it came right back . Then you get used to it , and you ’ re like , ‘ O.K. ’ But it wa a pitch that you really had to monitor where you were , how you grip it , because you could get in bad habit just from long tossing . It ’ s just an odd place to throw a ball . ”
 Halladay beat the Yankees three time in the second half of the 2008 season ; when Rivera ’ s teammate learned of his generosity to a rival , they fined him in kangaroo court . For Halladay , it wa a springboard .
 In the three year that followed — one with Toronto , two with Philadelphia — Halladay wa the best pitcher in baseball . He threw the most inning , averaged 19 victory a season , and his 2.53 earned run average wa the lowest among pitcher with at least 75 start . He won his second Cy Young Award , threw a perfect game and then threw just the second postseason no-hitter in major league history .
 Those three year gave Halladay a full decade at the top of his game — fewer dominant season than some Hall of Famers , but enough to sway the voter . Had he instead declined sharply after 2008 , he would have been the same kind of candidate a Johan Santana .
 Santana collected just 2.4 percent of the vote in last year ’ s election , not enough to stay on the ballot . But for seven season for the Minnesota Twins and the Mets — 2004 through 2010 — Santana wa every bit a dominant a Halladay wa in his first seven season of success ( 2002 through 2008 ) .
 In Santana ’ s seven-year run , he had 110 win and a 2.87 E.R.A. , with a WHIP ( walk plus hit per inning pitched ) of 1.063 . In his first seven year of stardom , Halladay had 113 win and a 3.19 E.R.A. , with a 1.132 WHIP . Santana had more strikeout , Halladay fewer walk . But their result were essentially the same .
 For Santana , though , that wa just about all he had . Besides a three-month renaissance in 2012 ( including the Mets ’ long-awaited first no-hitter ) , Santana wa finished . At his peak , he pitched like a Hall of Famer . But his prime wa just too short .
 Halladay ’ s prime lasted just long enough . It wa not all thanks to Rivera ’ s cut fastball , of course . But in those first three season after Rivera ’ s help , Halladay threw the cutter for 40 percent of his pitch — more often than any other starter in baseball . His other favorite pitch , the sinker , moved in the opposite direction . At time , it seemed unfair .
 “ Toughest on me ? Halladay , that sinker and cutter , ” Derek Jeter told me last spring . “ I tried to just guess which way it ’ s going to go — and I always guessed wrong . ”
 Jeter hit .234 in his career against Halladay , whose control wa so impeccable that his walk rate in those three year ( 1.24 per nine inning ) wa the best in the game . And if he ever lost the feel for the cutter , he knew where to find it : on the ball with Rivera ’ s grip traced onto it .
 “ I ’ d keep it in my locker , and when we ’ d go on the road , I put it in my travel bag , ” Halladay said . “ Stuck it in a shoe , wherever I went , and if I wa struggling , I ’ d just pick it up . I carried it the rest of my career . ”
 Perhaps that ball remains among Halladay ’ s career possession . What a poignant artifact it would be for the display case honoring the new inductee in Cooperstown .

 By Kirk Semple in Ciudad Juárez , Mexico
 In 1994 , Franklin Pupo ’ s father fled Cuba by way of Central America and Mexico , before settling in Las Vegas .
 Now , 25 year later , Mr. Pupo is following roughly the same path .
 “ Incredible , ” said Mr. Pupo , 40 , marveling at how his family ’ s history wa repeating itself .
 I spoke with Mr. Pupo and his wife , Yaima García , 37 , this week in an evangelical church that had been converted into a temporary migrant shelter . The building , a cinder block warehouse that previously served a a hardware store , wa tucked in a scrappy , semi-industrial neighborhood of this border city in northern Mexico .
 The couple ’ s journey had come to an abrupt halt here a month ago when their quest for sanctuary in the United States ran up against the cold reality of the border . They are now among many thousand who are waiting in Ciudad Juárez and other border city for their chance to apply for asylum in the United States .
 It ’ s a quirk of current migratory pattern that Mr. Pupo and Ms. García also find themselves among many other Cuban asylum-seekers in Ciudad Juárez . By the estimate of government official , a many a 70 percent of the more than 3,000 migrant waiting here to apply for asylum across the border in El Paso , are Cuban .
 In other border city , those waiting to cross are mostly Central Americans .
 “ The Cuban always try to be in a group , ” Ms. García explained . “ I see it a a form of protection ”
 How Ciudad Juárez came to be the preferred crossing point for Cubans remains a mystery . But migrant say that it ha the reputation for being safer for migrant and le crowded with asylum-seekers than other popular crossing point . Word traveled through the Cuban migrant grapevine — in WhatsApp messaging group , by phone and on social medium .
 While Cubans have been a common sight for year on the migrant trail through Mexico , their number rising and falling in response to event back home and shift in American policy , the flow appeared to pick up in recent month .
 Officials here in Ciudad Juárez said they began registering a sharp increase in the number of Cuban asylum-seekers in late fall .
 The Cubans , by and large , say they are fleeing political repression in the Caribbean nation . Cubans seeking sanctuary used to get special treatment in the United States : Under a policy known a “ wet foot , dry foot , ” Cubans who made it to American soil were allowed to stay and eventually apply for permanent residency . But the Obama administration halted those privilege in January 2017 , and since then Cuban asylum-seekers have been like everyone else .
 In Ciudad Juárez , they have run up against a Trump administration system that limit the daily number of asylum seeker allowed to present their case at port of entry . This practice ha given rise to informal waiting list in border town .
 So , the Cubans and others are biding their time — in migrant shelter , in budget hotel and in cheap , rented room — and suppressing the impulse to hire a smuggler and cross illegally .
 Mr. Pupo and Ms. García left Cuba on Feb. 6 , flew to Panama and traveled overland to Mexico , arriving in Ciudad Juárez on March 1 and finding their way to Solus Christus Church .
 The shelter is overseen by Lilia and Rodolfo Barraza , who opened it door to migrant on Feb. 26 after local official appealed for help in absorbing the flow of asylum-seekers into the city .
 Mr. Barraza , 65 , a pastor , said that initially he had been inclined to say no , but he remembered a biblical passage that described the moral obligation to do good .
 “ And when I thought of that biblical verse , I said , ‘ Bring them , ’ ” Mr. Barraza recalled . “ And the next day they were here . ”
 The couple ha hosted a many a 74 migrant at one time , jammed into a space suitable for far le ; there are currently 38 , all but one of them Cubans . ( The exception is a Venezuelan woman . )
 Ms. Barraza , 61 , said that before they had opened their door , she had never met a Cuban . “ But now I think they ’ re beautiful , ” she said . “ We love them . They are our brother and sister . ”
 The symbolic focus of the space is a white board on which is written the waiting-list number of the last migrant allowed to cross the border and present themselves to the American authority . A migrant ’ s number in line ha become almost a important a any other piece of data in their life .
 When a migrant ’ s number is called and they successfully cross , it ’ s a bittersweet moment for those who remain behind : They lose a traveling partner but move one step closer to their own appointment .
 “ It could be a week , two week , a month , ” Ms. García mused on a recent afternoon at the shelter .
 The number on the board wa 6995 . Her number is 7533 . Mr. Pupo ’ s is 7534 .
 For now , Mr. Pupo added , “ this is our refuge . ”

 MCALLEN , Tex . — The Border Patrol ’ s largest detention center ha swelled in recent week amid an influx of migrant family from Honduras , Guatemala and El Salvador . The processing center in the border city of McAllen ha frequently exceeded it capacity , leading to mass release of migrant that have overwhelmed nonprofit shelter .
 The building , known informally a Ursula because of it Ursula Avenue address , ha been criticized by immigrant advocate for holding migrant in large pen made of chain-link fencing . Manny Fernandez , the New York Times Houston bureau chief , spoke to Senator Jon Tester , a Montana Democrat who spent more than an hour touring the Ursula facility last week .
 The following is an edited and condensed version of the conversation .
 Q : What wa it like ?
 A : I wa there on Sunday ( March 24 ) . I ’ m not going to talk to you like most Democrats will talk to you . I ’ m going to tell you that , when I walked in there , it ripped your gut out . It made you cry . It did all those thing that people say it did to you , because you had child and you had mother . I looked at them a kid the same age a my grandkids . On the other side of the equation , there were a lot of people in a fairly small area , and the ventilation had to be pretty darn good because it didn ’ t stink .
 How many migrant were there at the time ?
 Twenty-two hundred . And their capacity is 1,500 .
 Did it feel overcrowded or just crowded ?
 Gosh , you ’ re asking the wrong guy , because this is the first time I ’ ve been in that processing center . It felt crowded .
 Can you describe it ?
 It ’ s a metal building that ’ s insulated . Each one of the holding area had a bathroom and a sink . They ’ re held by sex , of course . And then the family were held in different steel cage , basically . Everybody had a blanket that wanted one , Mylar blanket . Most of them were laying down on mat . Some of them were standing up . Some of them were sitting on bench .
 What were Border Patrol official saying about all this ?
 They said they were processing them through a quick a they could . They said the manpower they were using here wa manpower that they ’ d rather have on the border , but nonetheless they had to process these folk . Look , I mean , I don ’ t like prison . I don ’ t like holding people up . But the bottom line is that I don ’ t have any better idea than the way they were doing it , and I asked them if they did and they didn ’ t either , although they were tasked with trying to find a better way to do it . They were providing food and water and baby formula , and were treating these folk a good a they could treat them , in the condition that were there . I ’ m simply just not critical of Border Protection in this situation because I don ’ t know what the solution is .
 Some Democrats were calling the mass release a manufactured attempt to fuel the crisis-at-the-border narrative . Do you agree ?
 I don ’ t think I can agree with it . Look , I ’ m not a conspiracy theorist . I think I have to go with what I saw , and what I saw literally wa a bunch of family in this facility and I think it is what it is right now . The direction I would take it is , what are the push factor in these country that are pushing these family to our southern border ?
 Was Border Patrol cooperative during the tour ?
 They were absolutely cooperative . I ’ ve been on these trip before , and I know for a fact they show you want they want you to see . But they were very cooperative .
 Were the condition horrible ? Beauty is in the eye of the beholder , I guess . I don ’ t think they were horrible , but by the same token it wa gut-wrenching to see mother and child sitting there in cage .
 It sound like it wa packed but people still had some room .
 I don ’ t know how many square foot each person need to determine whether it wa overflowed or packed or beyond the pale . I just know a I looked there , there wa some space and people could mill around , although it wa very crowded . It would drive me crazy . My nearest neighbor is a mile away . It would drive me nut .
 President Trump visited a portion of the border wall in California on Friday , a day after backing off a threat to close the border with Mexico .
 The president floated the idea of closing the border last week — defending it repeatedly here and here — even a economic expert warned doing so could damage the economy .
 ( The agricultural and manufacturing industry would have been especially hard-hit by a closing , including a potential avocado shortage . )
 Instead , on Thursday , Mr. Trump said he would give Mexico a “ one-year warning ” before closing the border .
 “ If the drug don ’ t stop or aren ’ t largely stopped , we ’ re going to put tariff on Mexico and product , in particular car — the whole ballgame is car , ” he said . “ And if that doesn ’ t stop the drug , we close the border . ”

 A century after the first two woman arrived in Albany , New Yorkers elected a record number of woman to state government . Here are the story about how they made their mark .
 By Vivian Wang
 New York ’ s government ha never looked so female .
 After record number of woman ran and won in November , there are now 70 woman in the State Legislature , the most woman ever to serve in the state ’ s lawmaking body .
 But 2019 is not just a historic year for woman in Albany ; it ’ s also a historical one . Exactly 100 year ago , the state ’ s first-ever female legislator arrived in the Capitol , making New York the first state east of the Mississippi River to have woman writing law . ( New Yorkers also played a role in the eight frontier state that had already elected woman : Of the three woman who became the first-ever female state legislator in Colorado in 1894 , two were originally from New York City . )
 In the century since , New York ’ s female lawmaker have steered conversation on reproductive right , child care , education , labor and far more . Their bill have often inspired change on the national level .
 They have also made clear how far New York still ha to go . Even today , woman make up only 32.9 percent of the Legislature . That make New York 15th in the nation for female representation . ( Only Nevada is half female . ) Women still tell of sexual harassment and discrimination .
 Nevertheless , for 100 year , they have persisted . Here are some of their story .
 1919
 New York ’ s first female legislator arrived at the State Assembly chamber on Jan. 1 , 1919 . The armed guard couldn ’ t believe it .
 “ You must go to the other door , lady . This door is for member of the Assembly , ” he told Ida Sammis , according to her written account of that day .
 I wa thrilled by the opportunity for service which my new office gave me ; yet sobered too , by a sense of my responsibility , a a pioneer , in the law-making body of our State .
 IDA SAMMIS
 The election of Ms. Sammis , from Long Island , and Mary Lilly , from New York City , directly followed woman winning the right to vote in New York in 1917 . The woman ’ s suffrage movement had deep root in their state , most famously at the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention , and New York wa the first eastern state to grant woman voting right . Eleven western state and the Alaska territory had legalized woman ’ s suffrage before .
 New York ’ s law predated the 19th Amendment , which guaranteed woman ’ s suffrage nationally , by three year .
 Within 14 day of her arrival in Albany , Ms. Sammis , a Republican , became the first woman to sponsor a bill into law , when Gov . Alfred E. Smith signed her bill to regulate the hunting season for water fowl .
 She also attracted attention for her spittoon , a vessel that male legislator used to spit out chewing tobacco . Ms. Sammis had no use for hers — so she filled it with fern instead , a story that female legislator still tell today .
 Ms. Lilly , a Democrat , sponsored a number of bill that might seem bold even today . One would have forced the father of child born out of wedlock to pay child support . Others would have abolished the death penalty for minor , and required woman ’ s night court to have a female judge . None passed .
 The whole woman ’ s program failed and wa dubbed sentimentalism by the speaker of the house .
 MARY M. LILLY
 Her very first act a a legislator , she told a woman ’ s suffrage magazine in 1919 , wa to submit a resolution asking the state ’ s United States senator to lobby for the 19th Amendment .
 The woman , who both ran for office a widow , left observer pleasantly surprised . A journalist wrote in the New York Tribune in 1919 : “ Both are revealing to the people that woman with mature mind , at an age when some woman are beginning to worry about crow ’ s foot , can be of real service to the state . ”
 1930-1950
 After the initial victory of 1919 , woman ’ s progress in Albany slowed . Just three more woman were elected in the 1920s .
 But then the Great Depression , followed by the wartime frenzy of the 1940s , pushed woman into public life . In the Assembly , the number of woman peaked in 1947 at eight — the highest number until 1975 .
 In 1933 , New York passed a minimum wage law barring employer from paying woman “ oppressive and unreasonable wages. ” The law wa critical in the nation ’ s labor fight : It wa the first state minimum wage law after the Supreme Court in 1923 ruled such law unconstitutional . The court would eventually strike down New York ’ s new law too , but the backlash paved the way for a federal minimum wage in 1938 .
 Rhoda Fox Graves became New York ’ s first female senator in 1935 , winning an empty seat upstate . She had tried for the same seat three year earlier , running against the incumbent , even though local party leader told her not to . She lost by le than 200 vote .
 My house doe not suffer any more than my husband ’ s business doe if he is away for a day or two at a time .
 RHODA FOX GRAVES
 Ms. Graves served in the Senate for 14 year . By the time she died in 1950 , she wa still the only woman ever elected to the chamber .
 Still , the number of female legislator in the Assembly continued to rise , a men went to war and woman stepped in to take their place . Mary Gillen , of Brooklyn , pushed to create school lunch program . Maude Ten Eyck , from Manhattan , led a charge to make the state pay for child-care facility .
 The state university system , which now includes more than 1.4 million student each year , owes it start to Elizabeth Hanniford , from the Bronx , who wa elected in 1947 and helped write legislation to create the system .
 1950-1980
 When people talk about the woman ’ s right movement , they often mean the 1960s and 1970s , two heady decade of victory in state capitol , Washington and the court .
 In 1972 , Congress passed Title IX , to ban gender discrimination in public school , and the Equal Rights Amendment . The Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade in 1973 .
 In New York , woman saw their number more than double , and voter sent some of the state ’ s best-known woman — especially black woman — to Albany .
 There wa Constance Baker Motley , the first black woman elected to the State Senate in 1964 . ( Bessie Buchanan became the first black woman in the Assembly , in 1955 . ) Before she won that seat , Ms. Motley wrote the complaint for Brown v. Board of Education . She later became New York City ’ s first female borough president , and then the first black female judge in Manhattan federal court .
 I don ’ t think I have any attribute anyone else doesn ’ t have . I ’ m just a plain ordinary person . I think you have to look at my career in term the time in which I ’ ve lived .

 There wa also Shirley Chisholm , who wa elected to the State Assembly in 1965 . She would go on to be the first black woman in Congress , and the first black woman to run for president in 1972 .
 I ’ m supposed to be seen and not heard . But my voice will be heard . I have no intention of being quiet .
 SHIRLEY CHISHOLM
 Women were also scoring major legislative victory . In the 1970s , led by Assemblywoman Rosemary Gunning , New York City launched a housing court for the first time .
 Perhaps the most iconic moment in New York ’ s legislative history came in 1970 , when the state legalized abortion , three year before Roe v. Wade .
 The fight wa led by Assemblywoman Constance Cook . An article in The New York Times described how she argued for the bill : “ rarely raising her voice and never doubting ultimate success . ”
 In politics , it ’ s the pushing that hurt , to put your colleague to the test . That is not a popular thing to do .
 CONSTANCE COOK
 Ms. Cook ’ s husband wa clear about who wa the brain of the operation . “ Hell , she ’ s a woman , right ? ” he told a reporter at the time . “ And to get to where she is , she had to be at least a smart a the men in that game . ”
 That wa also true of Mary Anne Krupsak , a former state senator who in 1975 became the first female lieutenant governor of New York . To win that seat , she defeated in the primary the favorite of the state Democratic Party : a young man named Mario M. Cuomo .
 We ’ re going to have to win election , be there ourselves , and make it happen .
 MARY ANNE KRUPSAK
 Ms. Krupsak wasn ’ t done there . After her first term , unhappy that her running mate , Gov . Hugh Carey , hadn ’ t given her enough to do , Ms. Krupsak decided to challenge Mr. Carey for his job instead . ( She lost ; New York still ha not had a female governor . )
 1980-2000
 By the 1980s , woman had been debating policy and writing law in the Capitol for decade . But one thing hadn ’ t changed : The only bathroom near the Assembly chamber wa for men .
 The female lawmaker decided to act .
 Every time an assemblywoman had to use the bathroom , she approached the majority leader with a pink piece of paper , telling him she needed a pas to the lady ’ room , recalled Assemblywoman Helene Weinstein , who wa first elected in 1980 and is the longest-serving woman in Assembly history .
 At one point , the woman presented the Assembly ’ s leadership with a pink toilet seat .
 After session ended that year , the men ’ s room wa split in two , with one for woman .
 When this building wa built , there wa not anticipation that there would ever be woman serving in the chamber .
 HELENE WEINSTEIN
 The number of female legislator surged in these decade . Between 1979 and 1983 , the number nearly doubled , to 22 up from 13 .
 Then came the so-called Year of the Woman , the name commentator and historian gave to 1992 , when more new woman won seat in Congress than in any previous decade . The phenomenon arrived in Albany , too : Between 1991 and 1993 , the number of female lawmaker jumped to 34 from 28 , the biggest-ever two-year increase until 2017 .
 After decade of serving only on “ woman ’ s issue ” committee , such a social service , they won important post on other powerful body , such a the judicial , education and way and mean committee .
 Still , many of their male colleague saw them a something of a novelty . After Nancy Larraine Hoffmann , a former model and go-go dancer , won a Senate seat in 1984 , The New York Post called her the “ most beautiful woman lawmaker to reach the Capitol in decades. ” Eight year into her tenure , other senator were still complaining that all she did wa “ shout , walk and wiggle . ”
 Assemblywoman Deborah Glick deliberately tried to avoid attention to her appearance . The first openly gay member of the Legislature , she campaigned only in skirted suit and pearl before winning a seat in 1990 .
 I think for the first two year , I never wore pant in the Assembly . The stereotype were stupid but real . What are people expecting , me to roll up on a motorcycle ?
 DEBORAH GLICK
 Ms. Glick , who successfully led a codification of Roe v. Wade this year , after more than a decade of trying , said much had changed since then . She recalled that when she first took office , people asked what it wa like being the only gay legislator .
 “ I ’ d say , ‘ Homophobia would be a welcome change of pace because of the sexism , ’ ” she recalled .
 2019
 Whether it wa because of a blue wave or a pink wave or a fourth wave ( of feminism ) , woman ran for and won elected office in record number last year , in New York and around the country .
 It ’ s not just the number that are newsworthy , though they are : Twenty woman in the State Senate and 50 in the Assembly , the most ever in both chamber , many of whom unseated incumbent and bucked the wisdom of talking head .
 There ’ s also the staggering array of diversity that these woman bring . Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins , the head of the Senate Democrats , is the first woman to lead a New York legislative chamber , and Assemblywoman Crystal Peoples-Stokes , a Democrat from Buffalo , is the first woman to serve a the second-most powerful member of her chamber .
 Many people see only certain people in certain role , so I know that I ’ ve been given an extraordinary privilege to be in a unique position , and to be a representative in some way of people ’ s aspiration .
 ANDREA STEWART-COUSINS
 Assemblywoman Catalina Cruz is the first Dreamer . Assemblywoman Michaelle Solages wa the first person to breast-feed on the chamber floor , and Senator Julia Salazar is the first democratic socialist , a well a one of the youngest-ever senator .
 In just two month , the woman have led a dizzying push for long-stalled legislation , on both so-called woman ’ s issue — contraceptive coverage and abortion , for example — and others , such a protection for immigrant , gun control law and election reform .
 Men or woman who are sexist and don ’ t have the same level of respect , it doesn ’ t matter what your job title is . They put you in one little place and they still think you ’ re there , no matter what .
 CRYSTAL PEOPLES-STOKES
 In a speech on her first day a Senate majority leader , Ms. Stewart-Cousins marveled at the fact that not too long ago , woman had not been allowed on the Senate floor . Across the building , Ms. Peoples-Stokes wa striking a similar note .
 She quoted Susan B. Anthony by saying that “ whenever woman gather together , failure is impossible . ”
 Then she pivoted to another equally illustrious source . “ ‘ We can ’ t change the world unless we change , ’ ” she recited . “ Biggie Smalls . ”

 Brantley in Britain
 By Ben Brantley
 LONDON — Two intriguing , elusive people I wa never close to before are suddenly feeling like my new best friend . I ’ ve known Bobbie and Caroline for age . Yet it now seems that I really hadn ’ t known them at all .
 They ’ re so much warmer and cooler , funnier and sadder , more profound and more accessible than I recalled . The leading character of the musical “ Company ” and “ Caroline , or Change ” have been born again in two gloriously transformative revival here . And they ’ re singing with their heart in their throat , with the power to make grown men ( well , this one , anyway ) cry .
 Amazing , isn ’ t it , what a decade or so , a trip across the ocean and the perspective afforded by distance can do ?
 And , oh yes , in the case of one of them , a change of gender .
 You ’ ve perhaps heard that Bobby , an angsty bachelor of 35 , ha been reincarnated a Bobbie , an angsty unmarried woman of the same age , in Marianne Elliott ’ s enthralling revival of “ Company , ” Stephen Sondheim and George S. Furth ’ s 1970 take on the sting and sorrow of being single in swinging Manhattan . And what sound like a gimmick turn out to be a godsend .
 Starring Rosalie Craig a Bobbie , in a performance destined to redefine both a character and a career , this “ Company , ” at the Gielgud Theater , ha emotional coherence and clout that it never possessed in my previous experience of the show .
 The same is true for Michael Longhurst ’ s blazing interpretation of Tony Kushner and Jeanine Tesori ’ s “ Caroline , or Change ” at the Playhouse Theater . With a magnificent Sharon D. Clarke in the title role of an African-American maid in a Jewish household in Louisiana in the early 1960s , a work that might be described a a Marxist chamber opera expands in compelling way that make it both more epic and more intimate .
 “ Caroline ” and “ Company ” were always smart and imaginative show . In these production , their heart have caught up with their head .
 Though a source of some classic Sondheim cabaret standard ( “ Being Alive , ” The Ladies Who Lunch ” ) , “ Company ” ha shown it age in recent performance , like a Nehru jacket that it male character might wear . In particular , it leading man , the unhappily uncommitted Bobby , felt like a cipher and even a bit of a bore , a he assessed the life of “ those good and crazy people , ” his “ married friend . ”
 Originated on Broadway by Dean Jones — whose uneasy noncommitment to portraying a commitment-phobe register even on the original cast recording — Bobby wa a bluntly drawn prototype for what would become a Sondheim staple : the romantically ambivalent hero who doesn ’ t know how to love .
 Even etched memorably in smoldering fire and defensive ice by Raul Esparza in John Doyle ’ s 2006 Broadway revival , Bobby wa still hard to embrace or fully understand . No wonder his girlfriend said of him — in the great , close-harmony trio “ You Could Drive a Person Crazy ” — that “ you impersonate a person better than a zombie should . ”
 Those lyric are delivered ( deliciously ) by three men in Ms. Elliott ’ s version of “ Company , ” a a barbed valentine to the character now named Bobbie . Though you know where they ’ re coming from ( Bobbie is a quick to send her one-night stand packing a the male version wa ) , you ’ re unlikely to agree with them .
 That ’ s because , a played by Ms. Craig , Bobbie wear her feeling on her face — and in her long-limbed question mark of a body , and in her tender , yearning voice — in a way that the audience can always read , even if her friend and lover can ’ t . Like the Bobbys of yore , she ’ s amused and frightened by the perilously coupled partner around her .
 That double-edged response , by the way , really make sense when one of them is played , a she is here , by Patti LuPone ( in fine , penetrating voice and glowering form a Joanne , the part immortalized by Elaine Stritch ) . But Ms. Craig ’ s Bobbie radiates a longing that turn wistfulness into something close to existential anguish . No wonder she drink so eagerly , and so much .
 This revival also underscore our awareness that being a woman at 35 is still different from being a man of the same age . Bobbie enjoys her independence and her solitude in a very female way . ( She ’ s annoyed when her date leave the toilet seat up . ) She also ha alarming fantasy of motherhood , in which she see an assortment of overstressed alter-egos pregnant or tending , exhausted , to needy newborn .
 And a designed by Bunny Christie — who collaborated to dazzling effect with Ms. Elliott on the Tony-winning “ The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time ” — the latter-day Manhattan of this “ Company ” bear a tickling resemblance to Lewis Carroll ’ s Wonderland . Bobbi ’ s feeling of being odd woman out in the land the smugly married is externalized in room that keep changing shape and size — making her look grotesquely large , crushably small and even invisible .
 That this “ Company ” is set , the program say , “ in modern day New York ” only occasionally begets anachronism . Would a couple in the second decade of the 21st century really find smoking marijuana a forbidden novelty ?
 On the other hand , there ’ s a new , seriously affecting kinship between Bobbie and the character formerly known a Amy . The reluctant bride who sang the showstopping “ Getting Married Today ” ha here been blissfully reconceived a reluctant gay groom , played to agitated perfection by Jonathan Bailey .
 My date for “ Company , ” by the way , wa a British woman who didn ’ t know the show , but had lived in New York in the 1990s , when she wa in her early 30 . She marveled at how true the story felt to her own life then and said she couldn ’ t imagine the musical with a man in the central role .
 In other word , Ms. Elliott ’ s reconceived “ Company ” is that convincing .
 No similarly radical alteration have been made to “ Caroline , or Change. ” The libretto by Mr. Kushner ( the author of the epochal “ Angels in America ” ) remains the same tight , carefully patterned study of how an early lesson in economics left a young Southern boy with a scarring legacy of guilt .
 The 8-year-old Noah Gelman ( a very good Aaron Gelkoff at the performance I saw ) , mourning the recent loss of his mother , keep leaving spare change in his pocket . And his stepmother ( Lauren Ward ) decides that the family ’ s maid , Caroline Thibodeaux ( Ms. Clarke ) , whom Noah idolizes , should be allowed to keep whatever money she find in his clothes .
 From this simple plot premise , Mr. Kushner spin ever widening variation on the idea of change — personal and historical — a Caroline find herself sandwiched between white liberal condescension and a burgeoning spirit of African-American rebellion and resistance , embodied with particular piquancy by her teenage daughter , Emmie ( the excellent Abiona Omonua ) . Then a now , the intelligence of Mr. Kushner ’ s text is matched by the seamless variety of Ms. Tesori ’ s score , which incorporates rhythm and blue , Klezmer , gospel and folk into one shifting but seamless whole .
 ( Ms. Tesori is well represented in the West End season , with Shuntaro Fujita ’ s modest , engagingly sincere revival of her 1997 musical “ Violet ” at the Charing Cross Theater , with the appealing Kaisa Hammarlund in the title role — a part , if you like connecting such dot , originated in New York by Ms . Ward . )
 When I first saw “ Caroline ” more than 15 year ago at the Public Theater — in a production directed by George C. Wolfe and starring a very fine Tonya Pinkins — I found much to admire but le to love . Its impeccably assembled element often felt self-conscious to me , and I kept a spectator ’ s distance .
 But Mr. Longhurst ’ s production — designed by Fly Davis , with lighting by Jack Knowles — elicits a common core of loneliness among the character , while embracing the centripetal whirl that both keep them apart and fling them into collision . A similar double vision is focused on Caroline , a struggling single mother of four who know she ’ s been cheated by life , but is damned if she ’ s going to show it .
 In Ms. Clarke ’ s rendering , those socially suppressed feeling churn with such intensity that it make sense they should endow the inanimate with life . When her washer ( Me ’ sha Bryan ) and dryer ( Ako Mitchell ) sing to her , they ’ re internal voice that taunt and console . We hear the radio music she listens to through her ear , a it assumes the form of a Supremes-like trio with a Motown beat ( Dujonna Gift-Simms , Tanisha Spring and Keisha Amponsa Banson ) .
 And a the stage revolves beneath a silver-spangled moon ( Angela Ceasar ) crooning about flux and stasis , we sense a forward-rushing , cohesive momentum , a sense of time passing — and altering and destroying — that wa absent in the original “ Caroline. ” It ’ s a force that push some people forward and leaf others stranded , and so bereft and isolated it break your heart .
 These include , inevitably and tragically , Caroline . And Ms. Clarke give final , devastating voice to this awareness in a climactic aria that seems to shake the theater ’ s very foundation .
 Like Ms. Craig in “ Company , ” Ms. Clarke find the pulsing dynamic in surface passivity . And a show I once described a “ too good to be good ” grows into the titanic dimension of greatness .

 STOCKHOLM — It ’ s complicated being Greta .
 Small , shy , survivor of crippling depression , Greta Thunberg , the 16-year-old Swedish girl skipping school to shame the world into addressing climate change , drew a parade of fan one Friday in February on a frozen square in Stockholm .
 Six Swiss student had traveled 26 hour by train to seek her support for their petition for a tougher Swiss carbon emission law . An Italian scientist told her she reminded him of his younger , activist self . A television news crew hovered around her . Women from an antismoking group came to give her a T-shirt .
 Greta nodded , whispered , “ Thanks , ” posed for picture . Made exactly zero small talk .
 All this attention , she said out of earshot of the others , is great . It mean “ people are listening. ” But then , a knife-blade flash of rage revealed itself .
 “ It ’ s sometimes annoying when people say , ‘ Oh you child , you young people are the hope . You will save the world ’ ” she said , after several grown-ups had told her just that . “ I think it would be helpful if you could help u just a little bit . ”
 This is signature Greta . Wry . Blunt . Sometimes sarcastic . The opposite of sweet .
 It surfaced again on Friday , when Prime Minister Theresa May ’ s office dismissed school walkout in Britain a a distraction that “ waste lesson time. ” Greta swiftly struck back on Twitter : “ But then again , political leader have wasted 30 yr of inaction . And that is slightly worse . ”
 Like a modern-day Cassandra for the age of climate change , her solitary act of civil disobedience — this wa the 25th time that she skipped school to protest at Parliament — ha turned her into something of a global commodity . It ha inspired huge child ’ s demonstration elsewhere , prompted a debate about whether child should skip class for climate action , and invited troll , hater and skeptic who wonder who profit from Greta .
 The last six month have been , a she said , “ a weird contrast. ” They have compelled her to talk , talk a lot , which is something she is not accustomed to .
 “ All my life I ’ ve been invisible , the invisible girl in the back who doesn ’ t say anything , ” she said . “ From one day to another , people listen to me . That ’ s a weird contrast . It ’ s hard . ”
 At midday , a the sky turned gray , her father , Svante , brought lunch . Chickpeas and rice , which she ate , standing , alone in the crowd , in minute forkfuls , like a bird , before receiving a gaggle of third-graders in snowsuit . By the end of the afternoon , a full 7 hour standing outside in the cold , she wa very tired . All she wanted to do , she said , wa to go home and lie on the couch with her dog .
 Greta Thunberg is an unlikely , though not entirely accidental , activist .
 The eldest of two girl , she grew up in Stockholm . She studied piano and ballet and theater . She did well in school . Like many child , she watched educational film about the melting Arctic and the fate of the polar bear and the marine mammal bloated with plastic . But unlike other child , she couldn ’ t let them go . “ I became very affected . I began thinking about it all the time and I became very sad , ” she said . “ Those picture were stuck in my head . ”
 Adolescence brought social pressure . She wasn ’ t into the thing that many other kid were into . Mobile phone . Clothes . None of it interested her , her father recalled . “ I think she wa very isolated and very lonely , ” Mr. Thunberg said .
 By age 11 , Greta had fallen into a deep funk . She stopped going to school . She stopped eating . She stopped growing . She spoke only to family , and , at school , only to one teacher , Anita von Berens .
 “ Before , my own world wa very big , ” she recalled . “ I wa all alone . ”
 Is the alone-world still there ?
 “ Yes , ” she readily replied . “ But it ’ s getting smaller and the real world is getting bigger . ”
 “ I ’ m happier now , ” she added . “ I have meaning . I have something I have to do . ”
 It wa a cold , silver Saturday morning , the day after her weekly school strike . Mr. Thunberg had brought her to see the horse her family keep and share with other child in a stable outside the city . Greta brushed the animal , an Icelandic horse named Freyja . “ Like a massage , ” she said . She cleaned the gunk from it hoof . “ Mostly poop , ” she said . She tried to keep her black Lab , Roxy , from gobbling the stuff off the snow . “ Hopeless , ” she grumbled .
 Freyja , she said , is very stubborn , and it took her some time to get the bit into the horse ’ s mouth before taking her for a slow ride in the wood . Being with her horse calm her , Greta said . The tree should be covered in snow by this time . It ha snowed le than normal this year , she said .
 She remains tiny for her age , a consequence of barely eating during her struggle with depression . She doesn ’ t laugh much , or make small talk .
 Or , a she put it , “ I only say what ’ s necessary . ”
 She prefers the company of adult and animal to child of her own age . Bullying and depression have taken a toll .
 Getting through the rough patch took month . Greta said what made her feel better wa to be heard , first by her parent . She goaded them to stop eating meat . Then she goaded them to become vegan , which they also did , except that , according to Greta , her mother , Malena Ernman , continues to sneak in cheese . “ At night , so I won ’ t see it , ” Greta said .
 Her most important victory came when , in 2016 , she persuaded her mother to stop flying , which wa a big deal because Ms. Ernman is an opera singer well-known in Sweden whose career depends on traveling widely . Soon came a flurry of attention to the no-fly decision and , eventually , a book that Ms. Ernman and Mr. Thunberg wrote about how their child had changed them .
 “ It felt very good to be listened to , ” Greta said .
 On Monday , Aug. 20 , around the time her parent ’ book came out , she sat in front of the Swedish Parliament . Word quickly spread . Soon came an invitation to the United Nations climate conference and another to the World Economic Forum , in Davos , Switzerland , where she told a roomful of business leader that their financial success had “ come with an unthinkable price tag ” for the planet .
 Greta , for her part , ha told her mother not to join her at the protest . She said she doe not want anyone to think her mother put her up to it . ( Through her husband , Ms. Ernman declined to be interviewed . )
 Being Ms. Ernman ’ s daughter prepared Greta for this role . “ That ’ s one of the pro of having a famous mother , ” she said . “ I ’ m quite familiar with the medium and how it work . ”
 Only once , when she confronted journalist lined up to interview her at Davos , did she freeze . Like before , the word didn ’ t come .
 These day , she said , she think carefully about everything she doe — what she wear , what she say , whom she connects with on Facebook . She curate her social medium carefully , posting a picture of herself riding back from Davos by train , which drew attention to the conference participant who had chartered private jet .
 Sometimes , her public role brings unwelcome attention . A plastic-wrapped sandwich in one of the picture on the train brought criticism . A German politician , Paul Ziemiak , challenged her on Twitter recently by posting an unflattering emoji of a monkey covering it eye . He wa roundly criticized for picking on a child .
 And an investigation by the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet asserted that Greta ’ s name and photograph had been used to raise money for a start-up . ( Mr. Thunberg said the family had not been informed ; the start-up founder , Ingmar Rentzhog , confirmed that Greta ’ s name and photo had appeared in a financial prospectus for the start-up without the family ’ s prior knowledge but he denied that her name had been used to raise capital . )
 It prompted Greta to write a long Facebook post , declaring that she is acting independently and that neither she nor her family are accepting any money .
 Her former teacher , Ms. von Berens , marveled at her transformation . She also wondered what would happen next , when the attention fade . “ I don ’ t think this will be forever , ” she said .
 As for Greta , this is her last semester of 9th grade . She is weighing whether to take a year off to pursue her activism full time .
 Asked if she would go to New York in September for the United Nations climate summit if invited , Greta said she would not fly . But , she could sail there on a ship . And she ’ s learned that going on a container ship would have the smallest carbon footprint .
 Melissa Eddy contributed reporting from Berlin and Christina Anderson from Stockholm .

 AUSTIN , Tex . — Some idea refuse to die .
 When Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi wrote and directed the mockumentary “ What We Do in the Shadows , ” they , along with Jonathan Brugh and Ben Fransham , played centuries-old vampire in Wellington , New Zealand , struggling with their unending life and the quotidian frustration of modernity .
 It ’ s a comedic conceit these New Zealand native had been toying with for age , long before Waititi ( the director of the Marvel blockbuster “ Thor : Ragnarok ” ) and Clement ( who , with Bret McKenzie , formed the comic music duo Flight of the Conchords ) had any Hollywood standing — going back to the late 1990s , when they became friend at Victoria University of Wellington .
 After it opened — in 2014 in most of the world , and in 2015 in the United States — the film received some supportive review and gained a cult following . But it modest ticket sale seemed to drive a stake through the heart of any further possibility for it .
 Now Clement and Waititi have a new FX series , also called “ What We Do in the Shadows. ” It debut on March 27 , and follows a different crew of vampire and their struggle to settle down in Staten Island .
 On a March night , surrounded by the decadent revelry of the South by Southwest festival , Clement , who created , wrote and directed on the FX series , and Waititi , who directed several episode , gathered with Paul Simms ( “ Atlanta , ” “ NewsRadio ” and “ The Larry Sanders Show ” ) , one of their executive producer . They met here in an ornate chamber at the Driskill , a Romanesque-style hotel that opened in 1886 .
 Amid the spooky atmospheric element — some intentional , some accidental — they spoke about their affection for the undead and the creation of the new show . These are edited excerpt from that conversation .
 So FX showed me the first few episode —— [ the light in the room begin to flicker ]
 TAIKA WAITITI What happened there ?
 PAUL SIMMS It ’ s a vampire room .
 JEMAINE CLEMENT I don ’ t know , because my eye were closed . I wa relaxing .
 I wa saying —— [ light flicker again ] . It seems to happen whenever I talk .
 CLEMENT It ’ s your power .
 WAITITI Stop talking .
 I wa worried I ’ d miss your original film character in the TV version of “ What We Do in the Shadows , ” but I ’ m glad to say I didn ’ t .
 CLEMENT You didn ’ t ?
 WAITITI It ’ s a little bit of a Roman dagger in my back .
 CLEMENT We thought about that movie for a long time , over year and year . But the actual movie , we only shot for four or five week .
 WAITITI I really wanted to make a mockumentary thing because I ’ d just tried to make a short one about police dog . But the dog were played by people . This wa like 2002 , 2003 , and I thought that wa the easiest way to shoot stuff . Just leave the camera on — you really didn ’ t have to try .
 Where did vampire enter into it ?
 CLEMENT We had played this thing on stage one time . Taika , Bret and I all went to Calgary , to do a show , where one of u wa on stage playing a vampire , doing vampire joke . The only one I remember is like [ exaggerated Slavic accent ] : “ I just flew from Transylvania , and boy are my arm tired . Because they were wing , and I flew all the way. ” I think that wa Taika doing that , and then I ’ d get up from the audience , dressed a a vampire , too , and I ’ m heckling him .
 WAITITI “ You ’ ve been heckling me for 250 year ! ”
 CLEMENT “ You heckled me in Vienna in 1563 ! ”
 WAITITI “ And then I chopped your head off ! ” “ Ah , you have a new head , my friend . ”
 CLEMENT I forgot that joke . “ Yes , I have a different head . ”
 WAITITI “ Ah , but I remember the voice . And the heckles. ” When we first met in Wellington , nothing wa really open late at night except for video-game parlor . We would hang around , playing air hockey and doing those kind of character . “ Ah , my old rival. ” Just keep the stupid thing going on for age .
 Were vampire part of your cultural upbringing ?
 CLEMENT I remember waking up at 5 year old , and my parent were watching a horror movie . It wa “ Scars of Dracula. ” There ’ s a skeleton lying on a stone tomb , a bat fly in and drop blood on it , and it becomes Dracula again . It ’ s ridiculous , but back then , it wa like , whoa . I had nightmare about vampire after that for year .
 WAITITI I grew up in a tiny , tiny , tiny , little fishing village on the East Coast of New Zealand . Basically , the place where you ’ d take marlin to get weighed wa in this shed , down on the pier . And they ’ d turn it into a cinema for three or four month . So when I wa 7 or 8 , I saw George Hamilton in “ Love at First Bite , ” in this shed , projected on a sheet .
 CLEMENT Working with Paul and the other writer in the writer ’ room , not everyone knew about vampire . Taika and I know a lot about vampire .
 SIMMS Definitely , none of u knew a much a Jemaine .
 CLEMENT A lot of the idea in the first week , I ’ m just going , “ No . You can ’ t do that. ” [ laugh ] “ Vampires can ’ t do that . ”
 SIMMS I wrote a fantastic joke where they were having appetizer that were leech full of blood .
 CLEMENT Well , they can ’ t eat solid food .
 SIMMS That ’ s my point , still — they could just chew the blood out . The writer ’ room wa a lot of argument .
 Was it bittersweet for you that the original “ Shadows ” movie wa not more widely seen ?
 WAITITI How dare you ! My mom saw it and she loved it . That ’ s all I care about .
 CLEMENT I had the opposite experience because the idea came from when we weren ’ t professional at all , and it ’ s really u joking around with a bunch of our friend . It surprise me how many people have seen that movie .
 WAITITI Our production designer took the discarded green screen from “ The Hobbit ” and built a house out of it . And they were just going to throw it away and burn it .
 CLEMENT If you peel back the old wallpaper , you ’ d see the green .
 The movie generated a previous TV spinoff , “ Wellington Paranormal , ” which started running in New Zealand last year . When did you start thinking about this series for FX ?
 CLEMENT We didn ’ t . Scott Rudin saw the film and then started harassing u until we did it .
 WAITITI I wa in Hawaii , about to have my second kid . It ’ d be like three or four in the morning , the phone would ring , and it would be him .
 CLEMENT [ American producer voice ] “ Taika . We ’ ve got to do this show . When is this show happening ? We ’ ve got to get it rolling . I know it can go . ”
 WAITITI When it ’ s like three or four in the morning , the only thing you can say to get rid of people is like : “ Yeah , yeah , totally , just do it . O.K. , we ’ re doing it . Bye. ” And the show happened .
 CLEMENT The thing is , in the movie , we were the boss and we never had to take note . Now we have to take note from the network .
 WAITITI Take note on something you created and you know everything about .
 CLEMENT And a lot of the note are like , “ In the movie … ” Oh , man . We know . We did the movie .
 Did you ever consider reprising your movie role in the TV show ?
 WAITITI They encouraged u to do it . “ It ’ d be really cool if you guy were in the show , at least one of you. ” Well , I ’ m not going to do it if he ’ s not going to do it . Neither of u really wanted to do it .
 CLEMENT In TV , there ’ s just so much to do .
 WAITITI It ’ s hard enough listening to your own voice while you ’ re editing . And then also listening to your own voice while you ’ re directing . And acting . Doing a stupid accent and then stopping and giving a note . You ’ re just talking all day long .
 SIMMS I think Jemaine thought that it wa going to be easier than it is by not being in it .
 WAITITI We were doing night shoot in Toronto — when I say “ we , ” I had it easy . I came in for like the last three week . It wa like coming to a battlefield in France in World War I . They were so haggard and tired and half dead .
 CLEMENT It took Taika about three day to get that way .

 Critic ’ s Notebook
 An appreciation of the classic that define the city and set the bar for comforting food , skilled service and community .
 By Tejal Rao
 LOS ANGELES — It wa Friday night in Cypress Park , and King Taco glowed with neon . Inside , teenager in sweatshirt and shiny puffer coat tipped cup of salsa on beef-tongue taco . Cooks hustled , calling out order in Spanish .
 Angelenos don ’ t usually know where I live if I rattle off the cross street , but add just one detail — that the first location of King Taco is close by — and many of them can drop a pin on a map . A few have reminded me that Raul Martinez Sr. , who started the California chain in 1974 , drove one of the city ’ s first food truck , altering the course of culinary history in Los Angeles with little more than an old ice cream van and a stack of tortilla .
 The first King Taco is a cramped , vaguely peach-colored building at the end of a residential street . The window are covered up with poster of chimichangas and champurrado . The grout is stained . It ’ s nothing fancy . But like many old restaurant in Los Angeles , it ’ s a landmark in the city ’ s consciousness .
 As a new critic in town , I knew I had to start by paying respect to elder like this one — the steakhouse and the taco stand , the diner and the burger joint that have endured and collectively defined the city , a new contender have come and gone .
 The restaurant business is punishing , and Los Angeles is often misunderstood by outsider a a city without history . These place defy the stereotype , and draw diner of all age and background .
 I appealed to Angelenos for their favorite then set out to learn more . Slowly , I worked my way through a map of 30 or so restaurant , connected by a squiggly , grease-smeared line that traced a history , stretching back in some case more than a century .
 On the edge of Chinatown , I kicked around sawdust inside Philippe the Original while waiting for a couple of French-dips — the sandwich stuffed with thinly carved beef and lamb , the soft roll drenched with salty brown pan-roasting juice .
 Philippe ’ s wa founded in 1908 and moved to it current location in the 1950s . The menu reflects the grizzled taste of another era : I pulled the meat and elastic tendon from pickled pig ’ s foot , and marveled at hard-boiled pickled egg , still tender , dyed purple with beet juice , smeared with nose-tingling hot mustard .
 Just down the street , in the heart of old Los Angeles , I ate at Cielito Lindo , a small stand open since 1934 and largely responsible for the popularity of taquitos in the city . The tiny roll full of shredded beef are fried in wide pan , then soaked in a thin avocado sauce while still hot . They were properly drenched , but remained delicately crunchy .
 Locals and tourist stood in the sunshine , picking the taquitos up with their finger , talking between bite .
 Dan Tana ’ s , the low-key celebrity hangout in West Hollywood , took my reservation over the phone . I sat in a slippery booth with a burly , well-built veal parm , saturated in red sauce , almost hidden beneath a shining layer of molten cheese , watching the well-dressed server dress bowl after bowl of Caesar salad on a trolley in the middle of the room . ( And I did my best to ignore Alfred Molina and Eric McCormack at the next table — even a they broke into song . )
 When the weather turned cold and rainy , and the city got dark at 5 p.m. , I fortified myself with spicy clam broth at Beverly Soon Tofu , a small restaurant with shiny redwood table in a strip mall in Koreatown . Monica Lee , an immigrant from Seoul , opened her place in 1986 . Originally on Beverly Boulevard , it wa the first in the neighborhood to specialize in a menu of soondubu , or tofu stew .
 She bought soy milk to make the tofu in-house , and gave diner several option to customize their bowl — to choose not only the general direction of their stew but also the level of it heat .
 Ms. Lee , 65 , buy the fresh , soft , wobbly tofu now , but still get up early a few time a week to shop for produce . ( She tried vegetable delivery , briefly , in 1987 , but missed picking out the cabbage and spring onion herself . ) The tofu is ghostly pale and delicate , but the stew come out hot , bubbling vigorously and viciously , stained red with a chile paste that Ms. Lee make herself .
 While new restaurant in Los Angeles struggle to train and retain staff , the cook at Beverly Soon Tofu have worked with Ms. Lee for decade , fermenting kimchi and frying kelp . “ They speak broken Korean to me , I speak broken Spanish to them , ” Ms. Lee said . “ And this is how we work together . ”
 At the Tam O ’ Shanter , a Scottish-themed pub in Atwater Village , I lined up in front of Stevie Delgado for six ounce of prime rib with mashed potato and creamed spinach — a generously portioned plate lunch . The restaurant ha been open since 1922 , and Mr. Delgado ha worked at it carving station , by the bar in the dining room , for the last 30 year . He filled my plate in an instant , ladling it with gravy .
 Mr. Delgado slice five ounce of blush prime rib for sandwich , and either six or 10 ounce for a plate . The scale , which doesn ’ t move from Mr. Delgado ’ s side , isn ’ t for him — I think he could cut precisely 10 ounce with his eye closed . It ’ s for the occasional suspicious diner who doesn ’ t think Mr. Delgado is getting it right .
 The Tam O ’ Shanter server wear tartan skirt and wool hat , which can give the place the look of a fusty tourist attraction . But to dismiss it a such is to misunderstand the vital role it play for regular .
 Though the Tam O ’ Shanter wa a clubby hangout for Disney executive in the 1950s , the lunchtime crowd that now fill the kitschy pub is a more diverse representation of the city : elderly couple with their elbow locked together , immigrant family and group of young woman , clinking their pint of beer . They ’ re drawn in not just by the restaurant ’ s unfussy comfort food , but by it consistency and warmth .
 I enjoyed the steakhouse chain Lawry ’ s the Prime Rib , run by the same company a the Tam O ’ Shanter , even more after I learned that the Los Angeles chef Roy Choi ha been going to the location on La Cienega Boulevard since he wa about 5 .
 Mr. Choi ’ s father worked there in the 1960s , a a dishwasher and busboy , and the restaurant later became a place to celebrate important family occasion , like birthday and graduation .
 “ It ’ s been a part of my life before I wa born , ” Mr. Choi said . “ I think the moment my father could afford it , and I could chew , he took us. ” Mr. Choi , a founder of Kogi BBQ who also wrote the cookbook “ L.A . Son , ” compared Lawry ’ s old-fashioned banquet-hall environment to “ an American dim sum parlor . ”
 It ’ s never just about the food . Culinary institution often have the kind of professional , experienced employee that new restaurant can only dream about : Bartenders who can read the slightest change in body language . Unflappable server .
 At the U-shaped counter inside the Apple Pan , a sparse diner in West Los Angeles , the smoky burger in squishy bun are wrapped in paper and unceremoniously plopped onto the counter by a highly efficient staff with total command over the lunch rush .
 And when the server in a pressed red jacket at the Musso & Frank Grill learned that my dining companion wa pregnant , he wa attentive but not patronizing . Witty , but not inappropriate . This shouldn ’ t be so remarkable , but it is .
 Musso ’ s , in Hollywood , maintains an impossibly charming dining room with faded wallpaper and warmly lit burgundy booth . Under the influence of a bracingly cold martini , I wondered if it cold jellied beef consommé , eaten with a spoon — the kind of thing you ’ d feed a sickly Victorian schoolchild — stood a chance at a comeback . Maybe not , but the cocktail and steak are unfailing . The wedge salad are dignified .
 For hot pastrami , I headed to Langer ’ s , in Westlake , and to Canter ’ s , a 24-hour deli that opened in a former theater in Fairfax in 1953 .
 On return visit to Canter ’ s for sandwich and matzo-ball soup — and simply to be in it bustling dining room , among it regular — I found it particularly fulfilling to check in on the pastry case , crammed with sweet . I noticed how the word “ banana , ” written in bright yellow frosting on the chocolate-iced loaf cake , changed drastically depending on who had decorated it .
 The longer my tour of classic went on , the le dutiful it felt . There wa nothing campy or insincere about the pleasure of old Los Angeles . Not even it fast food .
 Mr. Martinez , who founded King Taco , went on to build a small empire of Mexican restaurant in Southern California , and the taco al pastor that he first peddled from a truck — a style of taco he helped popularize in Los Angeles before it became a staple — is still a reliably good snack in what ha become a neighborhood hub .
 The tortilla are hot and flexible , the meat crisp at the edge , pleasingly greasy and deeply seasoned . The salsa are one-note , but sing with power .
 Though the table were all full , a few people scooted down , pushing their bag and coat to the side , making room , gesturing for me to sit . To join them . To eat by their side . They might a well have said it out loud : Welcome to Los Angeles .

 Stylish venue have emerged to cater to a crowd that appreciates modern design , farm-to-table meal , and sipping drink a opposed to drinking shot .
 By Sheila Marikar
 I heard about it year before I first made it there . A beach paradise framed by turquoise water and hulking , golden desert rock , a place for spring break and bachelorette party , where , if the early ’ 00s MTV reality series “ The Hills ” wa to be believed , tequila shot and “ drama , drama , drama ” ruled . Cabo . Those in the know simply referred to it a Cabo .
 But there is a different kind of Los Cabos , an artful destination for discerning traveler that can be a laid back — or “ turnt up , ” a they say — a one desire . Of course , this sea-flanked strip of Mexico on the southern tip of the Baja peninsula ha always been about more than getting drunk and testing friendship , but recently , a variety of high-end destination have emerged to cater to the type of crowd that appreciates modern design , farm-to-table meal , and sipping drink a opposed to drinking shot .
 In July , Montage Hotels & Resorts opened an expansive , 122-room property on Santa Maria Cove . It ’ s one of the few swimmable beach along a 20-mile strip called the Corridor . Alan Fuerstman , the founder and chief executive of the Montage , spent 14 year searching for the ideal place along the peninsula to open a resort . “ You used to have to go to Hawaii for the kind of beach experience we offer , ” he said .
 With that in mind , he made sure every room at the resort ha an ocean view , and kept the design of the property minimal so a to “ exemplify the location , ” he said . “ We ’ re where the desert meet the sea , ” he said . “ The landscaping is not overly invasive . It ’ s that sweet spot of comfort and modern sensibility . ”
 The interior of the Montage project a Zen-like sense of peace . Rooms and suite , which feel like private residence because they ’ re clustered in small group , and connected by quiet , verdant path . The entrance to the 40,000-square-foot spa and fitness center ( which offer daily yoga class for those desiring more Zen ) is marked by flat , wide rectangle of stone that seem to float on a pool of water .
 “ I could ’ ve spent my entire vacation in that spa , ” my friend Joy Limanon told me shortly before I decided to book a stay in November . ( Though I ended up eschewing the spa for equally serene wave watching from one of the resort ’ s four swimming pool . )
 The Montage isn ’ t the only aesthetically minded resort to pop up in the region . The recently opened Viceroy Los Cabos and Chileno Bay Resort both embrace a design scheme of stark white wall and clean , perpendicular line that might be described a a sort of Cubism by the sea . The architect of Vidanta Los Cabos , which underwent a renovation in 2018 , took another approach , building a trellis-inspired tunnel that transport guest from the relatively nondescript lobby to a vantage point overlooking cascading swimming pool , airy restaurant and the Pacific Ocean beyond .

 “ We wanted to create a dramatic sense of arrival , ” said David Rockwell , president of the Rockwell Group , which designed the property and is famous for the sleek appeal of Nobu restaurant .
 This wa drama I could get on board with . I visited the Vidanta in April for my bachelorette party , which featured a slightly more elevated style of partying than the one advanced by “ The Hills. ” Seven girlfriend and I danced , waded , and posed for many , many selfies in a cabana fronted by a plunge pool at Omnia Dayclub , Cabo ’ s version of the Las Vegas daytime pool party scene .
 That same weekend on the East Cape of the Baja Peninsula , another woman happened to be celebrating her own impending marriage : Gwyneth Paltrow , the Goop founder and Oscar-winning actress . Ms. Paltrow chose the Costa Palmas development , which soft-opened in April , for her gathering ; it ’ s the site of a Four Seasons resort slated to open in 2019 and an Aman hotel planned for 2020 . About a 45-minute drive north of the Los Cabos International Airport , the East Cape offer sandier beach and calmer water than the Corridor , owing to it location on the Sea of Cortez .
 “ It ’ s a pure white sand bottom , ” said Jason Grosfeld , chief executive of Irongate , the firm developing Costa Palmas . “ like the Caribbean or Southeast Asia . ”
 When the Four Seasons officially open in April , guest will be able to take advantage of three restaurant , a marina , a 50,000-square-foot beach club and activity like water skiing , windsurfing and hiking . What there won ’ t be a lot of : building to mar the view .
 “ We ’ re forming the edge of stuff so we can capture the landscape , so the experience of the place is all about the terrain , vegetation and ocean , and being in the ocean , ” said Scott Glass of Guerin Glass Architects , the firm that designed Costa Palmas . “ Our architecture try to be really quiet . What we tried to do is kind of stay out of the way . ”
 While Ms. Paltrow ’ s # henweekend did not appear to involve the sort of bass-thumping revelry in which my group engaged , one thing she and I have in common is an appreciation of farm-to-table cuisine , which abounds throughout the region , thanks largely to Flora Farms . The owner , Gloria Greene , pioneered the locavore movement after she and her husband moved from California to his family ’ s Cabo San Lucas vacation home 30 year ago .
 “ We were living in his parent ’ house and it wa purchased by a golf course , ” she recalled . “ We said , ‘ Let ’ s get out of here , let ’ s move way out to the country where nobody will come . ’ ”
 They settled in Las Ánimas Bajas , on farmland about 11 mile from the airport . Ms. Greene had a baby and a subsequent yen for organic produce . “ My dad wa in the wine business , I grew up farming , I decided I needed a farm , ” she said .
 The farm led to a restaurant opened in 1996 , and today , Flora Farms encompasses not only lush garden and a bustling restaurant but also a market , 20 fractionally owned cottage , a spa , a tattoo parlor and a barbershop , where Ms. Greene herself cut hair . The plot of land that Ms. Greene thought nobody would come to 30 year ago now see about 500 people a day in it large restaurant during Cabo ’ s high season , November through January .
 In 2015 , Acre Baja opened nearby on 25 acre of farmland . it restaurant meld the coastal bounty with global flavor , dressing charred octopus with harissa spice and lemon yogurt . The owner , Cameron Watt , offer “ grounded luxury ” in Acre ’ s villa and tree house ; guest benefit from morning yoga session and proximity to Acre ’ s array of animal , including a donkey named Burrito . Visiting in October 2017 with my best friend from college , we sipped an after-dinner cocktail by a fire pit , marveled at the greenery and felt like we ’ d been teleported into a jungle .
 We had arrived in Cabo a month after Tropical Storm Lidia lashed the region . “ I ’ m sure that is the global warming , ” said the manager of the resort where we were staying . He lamented other factor that can stem travel to the region , like an August 2017 warning from the U.S. State Department that advised traveler to exercise increased caution in Baja California Sur , the state that contains Los Cabos , because of an uptick in violent crime , including drug-related killing . ( The warning remains in effect . )
 Provided you navigate Cabo with the same degree of caution you would any foreign place , there is so much good to be found , particularly now .
 Lest the influx of high-design , high-taste destination make it seem like the region is overrun with moneyed Americans , Ms. Greene report that her Cabo is more welcoming to tourist of all type than ever before . “ It ’ s become more diverse , ” she said . “ I look at the demographic of our restaurant and it ’ s 50 percent Mexican . It ’ s people from everywhere . ”

 At Earrings Plaza , a Herald Square emporium devoted to all thing bright , beautiful and cubic zirconium , the costume designer Montana Levi Blanco plucked a pair of feathery blue danglers from the hook . “ Something with a tassel might be fun , ” he said .
 Mr. Blanco , 34 , is designing Jeremy O. Harris ’ s “ ‘ Daddy , ’ ” which begin performance at the Pershing Square Signature Center on Feb. 12 . Set poolside , on the periphery of the Los Angeles art scene , the play ( a coproduction from the New Group and the Vineyard Theater ) namechecks Gucci sunglass , an Hermès Birkin bag , a Tiffany bracelet — item Off Broadway budget won ’ t cover .
 So you won ’ t find him in Bergdorfs or Barneys . Try Rainbow and Forever 21 . When a character ha to look classy : Zara .
 Earrings Plaza ha a special place in his heart — and wallet . “ It ’ s like this encyclopedia of jewelry , ” he said , noticing the parrot pin he ’ d used in “ In the Blood ” and the $ 8 earring in the shape of Africa that had graced “ Fabulation . ”
 “ Some of it is pretty hideous , but there ’ s always a treasure , ” he said hopefully , a morning flurry swirled outside . In deference to the weather , he ’ d topped what he call his uniform — a black Dickies coverall cut down into a romper , black tights , black Adidas , various necklace and scarf — with a rough-stitched red coat .
 Since graduating from the Yale School of Drama in 2015 , Mr. Blanco ha quickly become the go-to designer for Off Broadway and regional production that demand something more than realism .
 Working tirelessly and pretty much constantly — after “ ‘ Daddy , ’ ” he move on to “ Ain ’ t No Mo ’ ” at the Public , “ Djembe ! ” at the Apollo Theater Chicago , “ Skylight ” at Princeton ’ s McCarter Theater , “ A Strange Loop ” at Playwrights Horizons , and that ’ s just the spring — he can conjure extravagance of color , pattern , texture and shape for le than the cost of a single Birkin bag . Way le .
 “ He ’ s part anthropologist , part conceptual artist , ” said Sarah Benson , a director who ha worked with him on “ In the Blood ” and “ Fairview. ” Speaking by telephone , she also marveled at his “ amazing aggressive shopping . ”
 At Earrings Plaza that shopping yielded three pair of tasseled earring , some ’ 80s-style triangle number , restrained rhinestone clip-on ( “ I mean , I don ’ t want to say church lady ” ) and a bling-y peace sign pin . Somehow it came to $ 50 . Mr. Blanco kept the receipt .
 Born in Albuquerque to a single mother , Theresa Blanco , he had a close relationship with her mother , Stella Blanco , an artisan who designed lampshade . “ I grew up playing with fabric and fringe and electrical wire , a lot of the thing I now deal with on a daily basis , ” he said .
 He earned a dual degree in oboe and history at Oberlin College ’ s conservatory program . While studying abroad in 2004 , he saw an exhibit at London ’ s Victoria and Albert Museum called “ Black British Style. ” “ It wa the first time that I ’ d ever thought about the story that clothing can tell , ” he said .
 In graduate school at Brown University , he worked toward a master ’ s degree in public humanity , exploring he said , “ the black experience through clothing. ” He figured he ’ d eventually look for work in a museum , but in his last semester he stumbled into a set design class . On his second try , and now focusing on costume , he got into Yale School of Drama .
 The director Lileana Blain-Cruz met him there . They worked together on Branden Jacobs-Jenkins ’ s “ War , ” and Ms. Blain-Cruz wa immediately struck by “ how he dealt with contemporary clothes in a heightened way , ” she said . “ He think about color and palette like a visual artist doe . ”
 A few year later , during an Off Broadway run of “ The Death of the Last Black Man in the Whole Entire World , ” he would tell her that the character Queen Hatshepsut absolutely needed watermelon fingernail polish . “ And I wa like , ‘ Yes . Yes , she doe . ’ ”
 Mr. Blanco ’ s job , a he see it , is “ to figure out how best to tell the story and how to make it beautiful. ” After reading a script , he ’ ll begin to visualize a character , often with just a single garment or accessory , like the blue-green motorcycle jacket for Eddie Van Halen in the Atlantic Theater Company ’ s current production of “ Eddie and Dave . ”
 He isn ’ t much of a tailor . “ Nobody want me to be doing a hem , ” he said . Instead he ’ s a conceptualist who approach clothing a adornment , a artifact , a potential signifier of ambition , anxiety , desire .
 From college on , he ’ s had a particular interest in exploring how people in le affluent community show their style . “ I feel like I ’ m participating in this long history of people of color who use what ’ s available to create something beautiful and new , ” he said .
 To create the Brooklyn of “ Fabulation , ” which recently ran at the Signature Center , Mr. Blanco made a close study of his own Bedford-Stuyvesant surroundings and channeled that street style into more than 40 distinct , buoyant look .
 “ He wanted to honor the people in the neighborhood , ” said Cookie Jordan , a hair , wig and makeup designer who often work with Mr. Blanco . “ The joy , the family , the humor . ”
 Mr. Blanco doesn ’ t follow current fashion ( see the Dickies uniform ) , and he ha a complicated relationship to fast fashion , an industry that often exploit worker and generates waste .
 But when he ha to outfit a dozen or more character for under $ 10,000 , fast fashion — plus vintage store and a few costume stock house — is a necessity , and a place like Earrings Plaza is a gift .
 And every trip pay off . On the street , on the subway , he ha his eye out for a distinct outfit , filing away each image into a mental catalog . At a Korean bakery near Earrings Plaza , he clocked a grandmotherly woman , her puffer lined with leopard , her pant tucked neatly into her boot , storing that ensemble for later use .
 He also noted some bright pink sock peeking out of my black boot and guessed that either I had kid or I hadn ’ t done laundry in a while . Two for two .
 Here Mr. Blanco describes three recent costuming challenge .
 “ The Death of the Last Black Man in the Whole Entire World AKA The Negro Book of the Dead ”
 To outfit the character in Suzan-Lori Parks ’ s play , which Ben Brantley called , “ a fever dream from which there is truly no waking , ” Mr. Blanco explored African-American archetype and caricature , creating haunting collage that he made into sketch . From those sketch , he bought and built costume that brought the past explicitly into the present .
 “ We wanted people to see the historical reference and then also understand who those people have become , ” he said .
 For the character Black Man With Watermelon , he began with clothing a sharecropper might have worn , then added a beanie .
 For Queen-Then-Pharaoh-Hatshepsut , seen here in the gold dress , he asked himself “ who are our urban queen ? ” and based her look around woman he saw on his corner , “ the girl with the door-knocker earring and the chain and the sequin . ”
 The character And Bigger and Bigger and Bigger , in a black hoodie and persimmon shoe , evoked Michael Brown and other police shooting victim . Minstrel show figure , Blaxploitation hero and a Norman Rockwell painting inspired other character .
 “ Fabulation , or the Re-Education of Undine ”
 In Lynn Nottage ’ s satire of African-American striving , Mr. Blanco dressed a cast of eight in four dozen outfit . Initially he ’ d pushed for a heightened , comic sensibility , but after studying Brooklyn street style , he realized no pushing wa required . “ It ’ s already heightened , ” he said . “ I didn ’ t have to try that hard . ”
 Still , a scene set inside a social service department demanded particular ingenuity , a it included just about all of the cast and required a superfast change , which explains the bathrobe and the big coat .
 The office worker he costumed is a tribute to woman he knew who loved bejeweled sweater . The grandma ’ s animal print hair bonnet is borrowed from girl he ’ d seen at the Fulton Mall . The man in the red-and-white Coca-Cola jacket is meant to reflect , “ the pride you have in your look , ” Mr. Blanco said . “ In Bed-Stuy , and I ’ d venture to say in a lot of black neighborhood , the idea of looking sharp , looking fresh , looking clean is paramount , regardless of how much money you have . ”
 “ Eddie and Dave ”
 For Amy Staats ’ s “ Eddie and Dave , ” a loosey-goosey Van Halen tribute , woman play male rocker — rocker who in real life often wore woman ’ s clothes and favored feminine hairstyle . Mr. Blanco and the director Margot Bordelon determined that a sense of gender play wa crucial . “ The audience can never forget that these are woman , ” Mr. Bianco said . “ That ’ s part of the fun . ”
 Each outfit , he decided , should mix men ’ s and woman ’ s clothes , and he paid particular attention to fit and texture . After immersing himself in Van Halen picture and the hair-metal aesthetic , he went shopping .
 Here , the character Alex is dressed in a vintage black fringed jacket . Eddie wear a woman ’ s motorcycle jacket over a men ’ s denim jumpsuit that Mr. Blanco found on ASOS . Dave ’ s legging are woman ’ s , the mesh shirt is men ’ s and the fur topper is a grandma cardigan .
 For each look , “ what wa going through my mind wa , is it too masculine ? Is it too feminine ? ” Mr. Blanco said . “ Really it ’ s a true mix , even down to the shoe . ”
 A previous version of this article misidentified the theater where “ ‘ Daddy ’ ” is being staged . The show , a coproduction from the New Group and the Vineyard Theater , will be at the Pershing Square Signature Center , not at the Vineyard .

 The speed and power of the Rams ’ wrecking-ball lineman show that size isn ’ t everything in the N.F.L .
 By Ben Shpigel
 ATLANTA — The Rams selected defensive tackle Aaron Donald with their second first-round pick in 2014 , No . 13 over all , which mean that 11 other team , after assembling draft board and consulting scout and analyzing a trilogy ’ s worth of film of his demolishing offensive linemen , decided against taking a player whose dominance ha since redefined his position .
 “ I think , ” said Mike Waufle , the Rams ’ defensive line coach at the time , “ people were scared of his size . ”
 Donald is 6-foot-1 and , coming out of the University of Pittsburgh , wa listed at 285 pound . That is enormous in human term , but smallish for a defensive tackle , whose function in a 3-4 defense is to blot out the sun .
 Not everyone with the Rams coveted Donald , but Waufle wa undeterred . He had long prized speed over size , and from the start , he viewed Donald a an outlier , grading him a the best prospect he had seen since 1998 , his first season coaching in the N.F.L . Donald generated so much power that he reminded Waufle of the Russian boxer Ivan Drago in “ Rocky IV , ” who punched a computerized meter with such force that Drago ’ s manager remarked , “ Whatever he hit , he destroys . ”
 In his first season , Donald wa selected a the top defensive rookie . Last season , he wa defensive player of the year . After registering 20.5 sack this season , the most ever by a defensive tackle , Donald will almost certainly repeat .
 The Rams ’ ascent to a Super Bowl berth against the New England Patriots on Sunday from 4-12 buffoonery in 2016 reflects a certain harmonic convergence — the confluence of foresight , audacity and good fortune , with Donald embodying it all .
 Coach Sean McVay , a brilliant communicator whose football acumen pushed the Rams to the forefront of the league ’ s offensive frenzy , ha already spawned a coaching tree , and the team ha traded precious draft pick to acquire volatile personality who have meshed in a cohesive locker room . But before all that , the Rams had the conviction to draft Donald . In 2014 , he wa an excellent defender . In 2019 , he is the avatar for defensive disruption .
 With N.F.L . team eschewing downfield pass for underneath route , and Patriots quarterback Tom Brady averaging a mere 2.18 second per postseason throw in the pocket , according to Pro Football Focus , interior pressure is ever more critical . And no one plow into the backfield faster than Donald , a player New England Coach Bill Belichick called “ pretty much unblockable . ”
 “ If he keep this up , ” the Hall of Fame defensive tackle John Randle said , “ he can change the game almost like a Lawrence Taylor . ”
 Randle transformed the position , too , playing at 6-1 and 285 pound , but in a different era , when team prioritized space-choking interior tackle to stop the run and tended to harass quarterback from the outside . Of the 54 instance in which a player had at least 16.5 sack in a season since the statistic wa first tracked in 1982 , 50 came from defender who didn ’ t play tackle , according to the Elias Sports Bureau .
 Randle never quite reached that total , topping out at 15.5 . But contemporary like La ’ Roi Glover and Warren Sapp did , and Randle viewed them , and himself , a misfit , fueled by the perception that they weren ’ t fast enough to play linebacker , big enough to play offensive line or nimble enough to play running back .
 Across 14 season with Minnesota and Seattle , Randle amassed the most sack by a defensive tackle in N.F.L . history — 137.5 — by destroying quarterback and game plan much a Donald doe now , just with le time to get to the quarterback . Donald had a league-leading 106 pressure , according to Pro Football Focus . The next closest player , Fletcher Cox of Philadelphia , had 95 .
 “ When you get that interior pressure , they can ’ t run the sweep , the center can ’ t pull , ” Randle said . “ When you ’ re in the inside , you may not get there , but you ’ re in the quarterback ’ s face , and he can ’ t see because the pressure ’ s there . He see you , and he ’ s more conscious of you . You ’ re right there in front of him . ”
 When watching Donald , Randle notice how his foot , hand and eye work in concert , with a first step so quick that it can be mistaken for reflex . Donald ’ s arm allow him to get leverage on taller linemen — plural , considering the double team he face — beneath their pad , taking away their strength .
 “ Some guy at that position are top-heavy with skinny little leg , or are big down below but have nothing up top , ” Dewayne Brown , who ha helped train Donald since 2009 in their native Pittsburgh , said in a telephone interview . “ He ’ s built like a block , totally proportional . ”
 A secret : Donald may be listed at 285 pound , but , he said Tuesday , he ha been playing at 270 , maybe 265 . ( The Rams ’ other defensive tackle , Ndamukong Suh , is listed at 6-4 and 307 pound . ) Over text , Waufle call Donald a male model and tell him he ’ s pretty . Donald ’ s father , Archie , asked Brown to remind his son that he ’ s not a bodybuilder . In a photo he posted to his Instagram story Monday , a shirtless Donald is shown flexing , muscle bulging , his abdominal muscle clearly defined . Celery ha more fat than he doe .
 “ He ’ s got , like , an eight-pack , ” Rams defensive tackle Michael Brockers said .
 In the off-season , Brown help Donald refine his speed and agility with 45-minute workout laden with core exercise and resistance training , like the drill he performs wearing lateral resistor on his ankle . As someone drop a tennis ball eight yard away , Donald must sprint to grab it before it bounce a second time . Go on , try it .
 To increase his strength , Donald work with Dave Andrews , the strength and conditioning coach at Pitt , who called him “ a genetic mutant ” and “ a ball of dynamite. ” Andrews challenge him with exercise in which he provides Donald with resistance throughout the entire movement to isolate a particular muscle group .
 “ It ’ s no different than when they ’ re in hand-to-hand combat on the field , and they ’ re manually trying to resist what he ’ s doing , ” Andrews said . “ Most likely , it take two , maybe three guy , to slow Aaron down . You can imagine what it ’ s like in the weight room . Like , good luck . I walk out in a full sweat . ”
 Donald ha long been strong and thick ; a an adolescent , he would wake before dawn to lift weight with his father . But Donald wa “ real chunky , ” Brown said , when he first encountered him a a junior at Penn Hills High School .
 That season , Greg Gattuso , then the defensive line coach at Pitt , attended a Penn Hills game to scout one of Donald ’ s teammate . He had heard of Donald but had never watched him . Before leaving , Gattuso offered him a scholarship .
 With each successive season at Pitt , Donald had more tackle for loss . His senior year , nearly half of his 59 tackle — 28.5 — came behind the line of scrimmage . At the N.F.L . scouting combine , Donald ran the 40-yard dash in 4.68 second , faster that year than Raiders quarterback Derek Carr ( 6-2 , 214 ) , Patriots linebacker Kyle Van Noy ( 6-3 , 243 ) and Cowboys defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence ( 6-3 , 251 ) . His 10-yard split , which gauge short-area quickness , wa a solid 1.65 second .
 From afar , Waufle yearned . As defensive line coach for the Giants , he replaced interior linemen with speedier end to overwhelm Brady and unbeaten New England in Super Bowl XLII . He said he studied more game tape of Randle than Randle himself .
 Waufle wanted a Randle of his own .
 On draft night , Waufle wa working on a project in his office when , around the eighth pick or so , he glanced at the television and noticed Donald wa still available . He cycled through scenario in his head .
 He thought Detroit , picking 10th , would grab him . He thought the Giants , picking 12th , would , too . When the Rams were on the clock , he sneaked into the draft room , hoping for good news . When he got it , he nearly yelped inside .
 The next time he saw Donald , told him something he had never said to another player : Don ’ t listen to anything I say .
 “ We ’ ll get you lined up , and you just go , man — you just go , ” Waufle said , relaying their conversation . “ And he did . He tore the league up . ”
 Waufle left the Rams when McVay wa hired , after the 2016 season , but his successor , Bill Johnson , marvel daily at Donald .
 “ What make him different is no different than what make a racehorse so great , ” Johnson said . “ They ’ re just sort of made to be , I guess . I don ’ t know . If I knew , I ’ d be cloning it . ”
 Donald ’ s trajectory might have made team reassess their evaluation of him . It might have even made them more likely to consider undersized defensive tackle in the future — imitation and flattery , and all that .
 But there is only one Aaron Donald , and to the dismay of every other team , but most of all New England this week , he play for the Rams .

 A grand collection of miniature volume — 950 of them — is now on display at the Grolier Club in New York City .
 Selections from `` A Matter of Size : Miniature Bindings and Texts from the Collection of Patricia J . Pistner . `` CreditCreditCharlie Rubin for The New York Times

 The first miniature book to enter Patricia J. Pistner ’ s life were one she made with paper and a staple gun for her childhood dollhouse many year ago . She placed them on tiny doll table in tiny doll room and read them aloud to tiny doll . “ A house ha to have book in it , ” she said recently .
 There would be more dollhouse — one she and her husband built and furnished for his granddaughter , and the now famous Pistner House , a five-and-a-half-foot-high marvel of 18th-century French architecture and design that feature perfectly-scaled miniature reproduction , made over half a decade , by 65 artist and artisan . That led to a new obsession . “ I made a life-changing decision to put in a library , ” Pistner said , “ and instead of using faux book I decided I would have real book . ”
 Fast forward a number of year — and a number of course on antiquarian book , miniature book and the history of bookbinding — to now , when Pistner ( pronounced PEIST-ner ) ha become one of the country ’ s foremost collector of miniature book . About 950 book from her collection are currently on display at the Grolier Club , the nation ’ s oldest society of bibliophile , in Manhattan . ( The exhibition , curated by Pistner and Jan Storm van Leeuwen , close on May 19 . )
 Pistner , 69 , see her tiny book not just a intricately designed , differently scaled version of thing she love already , but also a important artifact in the development of book through history , reflecting “ the finest example of various binding style , ” she said .
 Most of the book in the exhibit are about one to three inch high and would nestle easily in the palm of your hand . Some are the size of a thumbnail . ( There are also a few ultra-micro-miniatures , with no dimension greater than a quarter of an inch ; one , shockingly , look to be about a big a the period in this sentence . ) The oldest is a cuneiform tablet from about 2300 B.C . ; the newest wa published last year . They are valued in the ten or hundred or thousand of dollar ; the rarest of miniature antiquarian book can sell in the six or even seven figure .
 There are religious book and history book ; almanac and devotional ; picture book and novel and poetry ; printed book and handmade manuscript ; collection of Shakespeare and book about the alphabet . Many are elaborately and extravagantly bound , with cover inlaid in material including gold and silver and jewel . Some were made a exquisite little object ; others were meant to be read frequently , tucked inside a pocket and carried close to their owner ’ heart for ease of consultation . Some are feat of extreme miniaturization . A few are token of love .
 At the Grolier , the exhibit take up just a modest-sized room and hallway . But it turn out that you can fit a lot of teeny book into a relatively small space . A few day before the exhibit opened , Pistner wa there to put the finishing touch on the display — she made the tiny stand for her tiny object herself , out of Vivak plastic-like material — and to talk about her passion for her book .
 Asking her to choose favorite is like asking a parent which of their child they love the best , but here are a few highlight from the collection :
 Here , in it original Latin , albeit smaller , is Galileo ’ s famous 1615 letter to Cosimo d ’ Medici ’ s mother , laying out his ( heretical ) reasoning for why the Bible should not be used a a basis for scientific belief . The fact that it is printed in 2 pt . “ fly ’ s eye ” type — by comparison , the type you are reading now ( in the printed newspaper , at least ) is 8.7 pt . — make it all the more exciting . It is considered to be one of the most famous miniature book in the world , Pistner said , because of it size ( the binding is 18 millimeter , or about 0.7 of an inch , high ) and the quality of it craftsmanship .
 One of two tiny eight-sided Qur ’ an in the exhibit , this is a complete transcription of the Islamic holy book , probably from the 19th century . It measure in at a mere 50 x 45 x 12 mm and ha fetching gold pigment on it cover and elaborate floral design inside . “ A miniature Qur ’ an permit a protective intimacy with the revealed word of God through wearing , carrying or close placement , ” Pistner writes in the exhibit ’ s catalog . In the Ottoman era , mini Qur ’ an were also placed on banner carried into battle .
 This very small 2,300-odd-years-old solid-black object is replete with writing , much of it consisting of apparently indecipherable magic spell . But around it side is a four-line invocation calling on the creator of the universe “ to give strength , health and salvation and to protect the wearer from evil and harmful spirits. ” Such object were actually amulet often worn or carried by their owner during the Roman Empire .
 The exhibit includes many weird and unusual type of book , including a single sheet of 258 x 7 mm paper on which the Lord ’ s Prayer ha been micrographically inscribed in black ink ; a 51 mm tall Ethiopic manuscript from the 19th or early 20th century , written on wooden board and stored in a two-piece leather case ; and a heart-shaped 19th-century possibly-French book that open into an elaborate puzzle of poetry and prayer . The manuscript above wa a diary written , in contravention of Navy rule , by a sailor aboard the transport ship Henry R. Mallory during World War I . ( He cunningly concealed it in a little brass nut that may have been part of the ship ’ s pipe system . ) The diary , on a single scrolling sheet of paper , chronicle meeting with enemy submarine , one that fire at the Mallory and one that the Mallory fire upon ; one that sink , and one that get away .
 This is a very rare example of the phenomenon known a triple dos-a-dos binding , meaning that three binding are connected to each other by shared inner cover . In this case , two separate book were bound together by mean of various complicated maneuver in late 18th-century France , with the two part of the first book , the “ Etrennes , ” split apart and all of the Almanac concealed inside . When you pick it up , you find it open like an accordion , in a sense , with one of the book facing toward you and the other facing away .
 In 2016 , a 9-year-old boy , Joseph Gama met Pistner by chance at a meeting of the Miniature Book Society in Texas ( he wa there with his father ) . Charmed by his wonder and enthusiasm , Pistner presented Joseph with a miniature book he had particularly admired . “ Things I Like , ” a compendium of his favorite thing , with illustration by the author , wa his thank-you gift to her a little while later . The thing Joseph like , it turn out , include truck ; bicycle ; rocket ; book ; his dog , Astro ; and Pistner herself , represented by the word “ And You ” on the last page of the book , along with instruction to smell the heart he ha drawn with a strawberry-scented crayon .
 The book here is presented inside a hollowed-out walnut with a golden inner edge , alongside a thimble and other sewing implement . Such so-called sewing nécessaires were in circulation in France in the 18th and 19th century , but it is very rare to find one that contains a teeny book a well the more obvious practical tool . “ Valeur et Constance , ” or “ Value and Constancy , ” is a Parisian almanac for the year 1823 , and it slip out of it slot and can be read ( albeit with some physical maneuvering ) even a it owner sews .
 This 14th-century book from Damascus contains two complete homily and a partial one relating to the founding of principle of the Samaritans , the longest-lived religious sect in Jewish history . Written mostly in Arabic with a few passage in Paleo-Hebrew , the book also contains a biblical account of the creation of the world , a great many call to repent , and various prayer for , among other thing , the well-being of the sultan . It is fraying at the edge but it word , in ink on parchment , are still perfectly clear .
 Not only is this one of the teeniest manuscript ever produced by the renowned London bookbinder Sangorski & Sutcliffe , it also contains two of the most stirring speech in American history : The Gettysburg Address and Lincoln ’ s Second Inaugural Address . The book wa exquisitely handwritten and illuminated around 1930 by Alberto Sangorski , brother of one of the firm ’ s founder , and includes a tiny painting of Lincoln . Founded at the beginning of the 20th century , Sangorski & Sutcliffe became known for reviving the Middle Ages custom of creating sumptuous jeweled binding , in which leather cover are elaborately inlaid with gold , silver and precious and semiprecious stone . Its most famous work — a luxurious binding for a ( non-miniature ) copy of the Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám , which took two and a half year to make and had a front cover decorated with three golden peacock and inlaid with 1,000 jewel — sadly went down with the Titanic .
 The cover of this cunning little almanac is made with , among other thing , bloodstone , glass , gold , woven textile and braid of hair , along with the initial A.C. Two gold frame , on the front and the back cover , show a snake biting it tail in an endless circle symbolizing eternity . It is believed such book were given by a person to his or her beloved a a pledge of endless devotion .
 How tiny is this volume ? So tiny that it is known a an ultra-micro book , with dimension of 0.75 x 0.75x 1 mm . So tiny that when you look at it in it display case , what you see is an almost imperceptible black speck in the middle of a tiny circle inside another , slightly larger circle . ( The version above is enlarged . ) The book , one of 245 copy printed in Tokyo in 2012 , contains printed letter that are .01 mm wide a well a ridiculously small illustration of 12 type of Japanese flower found in the four season of the year . To help put it in perspective , it is displayed with an enlarged version of the book , with a ( relatively ) gigantic 13 x 13 mm binding , and an 8x magnifying glass .

 Wealth Matters
 By Paul Sullivan
 Most New Year ’ s resolution turn out to be le successful than people expect when they make them , starting with high-minded goal for fitness .
 But this is a column about people who make wholesale life change , people with financially solid career who risk that stability . What they share is a single-minded focus on a niche , not an overarching vision to change the world .
 Monique Greenwood is one of them . She wa the editor in chief of Essence Magazine , her childhood dream job . But a she wa working on a book , “ Having What Matters , ” she realized that what she really wanted wa to concentrate on what had been a sideline and go into the bed-and-breakfast business .
 “ I decided I wa worth the investment , ” Ms. Greenwood said .
 For Lisa Congdon , the change wa le an epiphany . She wa working in a senior role at an education nonprofit organization and decided to take art class on the side “ with zero intention of becoming an artist ; it wa to balance office work. ” Some 10 year later , she left the stable job to become a commercial artist and illustrator .
 Sara Bliss , author of “ Take the Leap : Change Your Career , Change Your Life , ” said that Ms. Greenwood , Ms. Congdon and the other people in her book who did change career shared a pragmatism about how to make the change , even if their reason varied .
 “ I think you have to get comfortable with risk because they knew there wa risk involved and they needed to put in their all , ” Ms. Bliss said . “ Seventy percent of the people are either making the same or more today , which surprised me . ”
 Some of the people Ms. Bliss wrote about said they felt they didn ’ t have other good option .
 Judson Kauffman spent his 20 a a member of the Navy SEALs , doing two tour in Iraq and ending his active-duty service a a sniper instructor . When he left the Navy in 2010 , he spent two more year in a civilian role supporting Navy recruiting .
 “ It wa very scary to get out , ” Mr. Kauffman , now 35 , said of leaving the Navy . “ The military teach you how to be soldier , but there isn ’ t a lot of time put into the transition out . ”
 After casting around to find a new career , he and a fellow Navy SEAL veteran started a firm , Exbellum , to help company recruit other special operation veteran . “ I had no other option , ” he said . “ I quit my job , and no one else wa hiring me . I had to make it work . ”
 “ I ’ d begun to meet people in business , and they said , ‘ Boy , we ’ d love to hire guy like you , ’ but there wa a disconnect , ” he said . The company weren ’ t actually hiring those veteran .
 Mr. Kauffman ’ s firm set out to show company that engaging in armed conflict wa only a small part of what the Special Operations veteran had done . So Exbellum highlighted how the veteran were expert at managing personnel , logistics and multimillion-dollar budget .
 At the end of last year , he sold the firm to Forged Consulting in Dallas . He ha since started two other company , one that distills sotol , a plant indigenous to Texas , and another that is in the submarine business .
 “ We had an adviser who said we could continue growing this and could sell it for a lot to a Deloitte or a Bain , ” he said of two major consulting firm . “ I made a decision to be a happier person , which includes discontinuing thing that don ’ t give me joy . ”
 The motivation to change career wa different for Ms. Greenwood , who had become the editor in chief of Essence a few year before she bought her first property . She said she had run her first bed-and-breakfast in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn while still working for the magazine . Her husband wa also working full time .
 “ As we got more popular , I ’ d get guest who wanted to come during the week , ” she said . “ We ’ d ask them , ‘ What brings you to town ? ’ If they were coming for a conference , we ’ d say yes , because they were on the same schedule a u . But if they said , ‘ We ’ re coming for our wedding anniversary , ’ we ’ d say we were booked because we couldn ’ t be there to check them in . ”
 Her nod to pragmatism ended up making that first bed-and-breakfast seem more exclusive than it really wa .
 By 2002 , Ms. Greenwood wa successful enough that she resigned a editor of Essence . She now ha five inn under the Akwaaba brand .
 “ I have accumulated wealth , ” she said . “ I don ’ t pay me what Essence paid me , but my wealth is 10 time what it wa . I have million-dollar real estate . I could sell this tomorrow , and say it ’ s O.K . ”
 Others , like Ms. Congdon , made change incrementally . After moving from classroom teaching to working in a nonprofit organization in 2002 , she began taking art class to get more creativity in her life .
 “ I started taking class on the side with zero intention of becoming an artist , ” she said . “ It wa to balance office work . ”
 But with the rise of Flickr , then Etsy , she put her illustration and graphic design online , and they began to sell . She had a show in Seattle in 2006 and sold everything . In 2007 , a show in New York sold out before it opened .
 By 2011 , with a deal to illustrate book , her income from art matched her income from her nonprofit work , which wa in the high five figure . Her number of Etsy follower rising , she decided she could leave her other career behind .
 “ I understood early on that to make a living I couldn ’ t put all my egg in one basket , and I still do that to a certain extent , ” Ms. Congdon said .
 The difference now is she is earning far more than she did in her previous career , through a mix of commercial illustration , book , lecture and class . Online sale alone are well into the six figure .
 Not all people made career change for financial reward . After finishing law school at the University of Pennsylvania , Aaron Walker joined a corporate law firm . But he decided the work wasn ’ t for him , and he switched to an education nonprofit organization . Then , in 2013 , he started Camelback Ventures , a nonprofit fund that promotes entrepreneur of color for role like portfolio management in impact investing , a type of investment with a social conscience .
 “ There are definitely day when I ’ m reminded that if I ’ d stayed at the law firm or done something else I would have made a lot more money in the last five year , ” Mr. Walker said . “ But I get to wake up every morning and do what I want . I ’ ve also made more money in the last 10 year than my mother ha made in the last 30 year . ”
 These people made their career change voluntarily . But others were forced to move out of economic necessity .
 In her late 20 , Katie Warner Johnson found herself at a turning point in her career . Despite professional ballet credential , including a stint in the musical “ Cats , ” and an undergraduate degree from Harvard , she wa working a a trainer in Los Angeles and had just been rejected by every business school she applied to .
 “ Being a fitness instructor at $ 80 an hour sound great , but you ’ re only working 11 to 21 hour a week , ” she said . “ I had no wealth . ”
 So in 2012 , she decided to start a business , thinking that it would help her business school application the next time . The company , which became Carbon38 , an online store for woman ’ s athletic and leisure apparel , started by raising money through the usual route of going to family and friend . She then won a venture capital competition , which led to additional funding .
 “ Pretty quickly , I raised $ 1 million , and I couldn ’ t exactly go back to business school , ” she said . From 2012 to 2016 , the company raised $ 11 million , mostly in small check . Then Foot Locker , the athletic shoe retailer , made a $ 15 million investment .
 At time , she said , she marvel at how much the company ha grown in five year . Just in the last year , it ha doubled in size and now ha close to 100 full-time employee .
 “ I ’ m a dancer — we pick up choreography very quickly , ” she said . “ I ’ ve been trained by birth to adapt . ”

 The Japanese organizer may be the star of the moment , but others have equally appealing theory and strategy for decluttering your home .
 By Ronda Kaysen
 Spring cleaning started early this year , with the January release of the Netflix series “ Tidying Up With Marie Kondo ” initiating something of a national closet-clearing frenzy .
 Charities have been inundated with donation , and Instagram feed have overflowed with tidying hash tag like # sparkjoy and # konmari , nod to the Japanese organizer ’ s method of keeping only item that bring you joy .
 Ms. Kondo , who leapt into the American consciousness in 2014 with the release of her book “ The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up , ” is not alone in her fascination with order . Three new book also grapple with the topic , offering clutter-weary reader various perspective , and strategy , on managing their stuff .
 There ’ s “ Outer Order , Inner Calm : Declutter and Organize to Make More Room for Happiness , ” by Gretchen Rubin , author of the best-selling book “ The Happiness Project. ” And “ The Home Edit : A Guide to Organizing and Realizing Your House Goals , ” by Clea Shearer and Joanna Teplin , a home-organizing duo with a million Instagram follower . And also Joshua Becker ’ s “ The Minimalist Home : A Room-by-Room Guide to a Decluttered , Refocused Life . ”
 The book hit shelf at a moment when Americans are collectively looking into their closet and wondering what could go .
 When Ms. Kondo ’ s show first aired on Netflix , thredUP , the online consignment shop , reported an 80 percent surge in request for Clean Out kit , the bag customer fill with everything they want to sell . And Housing Works saw a 15 percent increase in donation to it New York City thrift store .
 Even Ms. Kondo seems caught off guard by the response . “ I am very surprised by the immensity of the reaction , ” she said , speaking through an interpreter over Google Chat . “ But in regard to the impact that tidying can have on people ’ s life , that ’ s something that I knew and I believed in from the beginning . ”
 No longer a mundane household chore , home organizing now fall squarely into the wellness category , another step on the endless road to self-improvement . Clean up your living room and you can clean up your life .
 Each of the recently released book espouses the need for a more streamlined approach to life , but with slightly different recommendation on how to get there , and different expectation for how much stuff you need in your home .
 Where “ The Minimalist Home ” champion a life with a few possession a possible , offering a room-by-room guide on how to get there , “ The Home Edit ” focus on categorizing possession in stylish container , turning drawer and closet into whimsical storage system , offering various solution depending on the size and style of your pantry .
 And Ms. Rubin , in “ Outer Order , Inner Calm , ” see power in organizing specific place , like the coat closet ( or the kitchen or the sock drawer ) . If you know where to put your hat and glove when you walk in the door , and where to find them when you ’ re ready to leave , you can focus on bigger life hurdle . “ When you feel more in control of yourself , when you feel like you have more self-command , it can help you do harder thing , ” she said . “ Feeling like your coat closet is under control could help you eat more healthfully or exercise better . ”
 Ms. Rubin doe not suggest any one way to organize that closet . Instead , she suggested , “ Do it in a way that work for you . You may want to do it all in one Saturday. ” Or perhaps you ’ d rather spend 10 minute a day tidying up for a year .
 The goal , she argues — with heading like “ Are you a counter-filler or a counter-clearer ? ” — is to figure out what motivates you and then find a system that work , whatever that may be .
 Tidying , it turn out , is big business , with the home-organization industry growing at 4 percent a year , and earning $ 16 billion in retail sale in 2016 , Mr. Becker said in “ The Minimalist Home. ” And it ’ s no wonder . As baby boomer downsize , they have le room to store stuff , and their grown child have little interest in taking their parent ’ bureau and dining set .
 Millennials , saddled with student debt and stagnating wage , are slow to buy and fill big home . Technology ha made it easier to pare down , allowing u to store and access our music , book and photo on the cloud . Online clothing rental service like Rent the Runway chip away at our closet , too . The average number of item in the American closet dropped to 136 in 2019 , down from 164 in 2017 , according to thredUP .
 In the age of Instagram and Pinterest , a clean closet is one thing , but a color-coded one with matching bin is something to marvel at and sure to generate load of like . In come Ms. Shearer and Ms. Teplin , whose organizing business , The Home Edit , started in 2015 , quickly amassed a client list of boldface name including Gwyneth Paltrow , Khloé Kardashian , Mandy Moore , Laura Dern and Mindy Kaling .
 “ Why can ’ t we make an organizing aesthetic that make people drool ? ” said Ms. Shearer , who wa raised in celebrity circle in Los Angeles . To start the business , based in Nashville , where Ms. Shearer and Ms. Teplin live , she tapped her connection . “ Selma Blair , Christina Applegate and Marla Sokoloff were some of the very first project we did because of my close relationship to each of them , ” she said . “ They really helped u gain traction early on . ”

 The Home Edit us label written in Ms. Shearer ’ s loopy script and affix them to bin and basket full of color-coordinated item , turning closet and drawer into photogenic system . On The Home Edit website , you can buy bin , basket , jar and custom-made label .
 “ Labeling is truly where the form and the function collide , ” Ms. Shearer said .
 But if you turn to “ The Minimalist Home , ” you may not need to buy any bin because , presumably , you won ’ t have much stuff left once you ’ re done .
 “ If you have to buy stuff to store your stuff , you probably have too much stuff , ” said Mr. Becker , who also run Uncluttered , a 12-week online course for aspiring minimalist . The minimalist theory is simple : Own le , and the energy you wasted tending to your possession could be redirected elsewhere .
 “ Organizing is only a temporary solution , ” Mr. Becker said . “ Owning le is a permanent solution . Once you get those thing out of your house , you never have to organize them again . ”
 Ms. Kondo also subscribes to a philosophy of le is more , albeit one rooted in the idea that some possession bring happiness and should be cherished . Before you store anything , she advises , “ first think about what it is that you want to retain in your life . ”
 Regardless of the method , the process of decluttering take work . Here are three homeowner who used different organizing method to bring order to their home and are now happily living with le clutter .
 In 2017 , Seri Kertzner , the chief party officer for Little Miss Party in a Box , could not figure out how to organize all the confetti , plate , cup and supply . She had recently moved the company ’ s office out of her two-bedroom Greenwich Village apartment and into a studio in the same building , but still struggled to keep the closet in order . “ It wa hard for me to know what inventory I had , ” she said .
 So she hired The Home Edit , drawn by their stylish look . “ I have to say , the handwritten label on everything hooked me , ” said Ms. Kertzner , 40 , who previously worked in fashion at J . Crew . “ I wa taken with how they made everything look . It wa not just organized ; it wa style . ”
 In a one-day job , a two-person team measured the space , purged the excess and then went shopping , returning with dozen of container . Now , with the closet tastefully organized , Ms. Kertzner can find and account for her inventory quickly .
 She also took the skill back to her apartment , where she life with her husband and two young son . She reorganized their toy , color coordinating them , and the kitchen cabinet , ordering label online from The Home Edit . “ Now everyone in my home know where everything go , ” she said .
 Since Tamika Francois-Lawson wa in her 20 , she imagined having a sleek , minimalist home unobstructed by clutter . But that never seemed to happen . The 38-year-old speech pathologist life in a three-bedroom house in Springfield Gardens , Queens , with her husband , Ernest Lawson , 42 , a lawyer , and their four-year-old daughter . Despite her best effort , Ms. Francois-Lawson kept accumulating stuff , particularly baby gear .
 “ My goal wa minimalism , but it wasn ’ t happening the way I envisioned it , ” she said . “ I needed to buy stuff , and I wa feeling guilty . ”
 Then she read Ms. Kondo ’ s book and wa drawn to the message that she could keep whatever sparked joy , she said , “ even if it wa something that didn ’ t make sense to anyone else . ”
 In November , she called Patty Morrissey , an organizer in Huntington , N.Y. , trained in Ms. Kondo ’ s KonMari method , beginning a monthslong process with Thu Huynh , who work for Ms. Morrissey . For clothing , Ms. Huynh encouraged Ms. Francois-Lawson to contemplate the image she wanted to project to the world , tossing everything else .
 For book , Ms. Huynh suggested Ms. Francois-Lawson choose five favorite , instructing her to keep only the one that met that standard . “ That wa an eye-opener , ” Ms. Francois-Lawson said . “ It helped me home in on what my true passion were . I almost cried when she put together my bookshelf and in front of me I saw everything that I hold so dear . ”
 For year , Karen Lynch prepared for visitor to her five-bedroom home in Burlingame , Calif. , by grabbing plastic bin , filling them with all the clutter she could find and hiding them in closet , the trunk of her car or a bathtub .
 “ It ’ s about appearance ; it ’ s about the mask that I wear , ” said Ms. Lynch , 52 , a life coach who life with her husband , Paul Lynch , 53 , an electrician , and their two teenage son . “ I want everybody to see me a having a neat , clean , organized house . ”
 But eventually she wanted a permanent solution . She tried the KonMari method , but found that she could always make excuse , claiming almost any item brought her joy . Then , in September , after seeing an ad for Mr. Becker ’ s Uncluttered course , she decided to give minimalism a try .
 For three month , she removed six to eight bag of stuff from her house a week . In January , she signed up for the course again , following the weekly challenge , chatting with other student on the private Facebook group and making weekly trip to a local thrift store to drop off item .
 She now shop differently , too , no longer thoughtlessly ordering from catalog or window shopping in boutique . “ Now every purchase is : Can I buy it used ? Do I need it ? Can I borrow it from somebody ? ” she said .
 But she still see a long way to go . “ I ’ m a minimalist with training wheel , ” she said .

 AUSTIN , Tex . — When she wa around 11 , Lupita Nyong ’ o ’ s parent brought home a cassette tape that changed her life . It wa of the song “ Regulate ” by the West Coast hip-hop dynast Warren G and Nate Dogg . Nyong ’ o and her five sibling , then living in a suburb of Nairobi , could only partially savor the lyric of the song — a hearty , slang-ridden narrative of a thwarted mugging , topped with a soupçon of ceremonial group sex . But the music wa hypnotic and evocative , suggesting an absorbing pocket universe . Nyong ’ o remembers wearing the tape out , rewinding it over and over until she knew all of the word by heart .
 Of the many apparently effortless but difficult-to-emulate thing the 36-year-old star of “ Us , ” the new psychological horror film from Jordan Peele , ha done in front of a camera , it ’ s worth taking a moment to consider the rapping . She ’ s done it twice , both time in video filmed in the back seat of a car and posted on Instagram : the first to celebrate her three millionth follower and the second with her “ Black Panther ” co-star Letitia Wright , on the week of the film ’ s premiere .
 No one would call Nyong ’ o the next Warren G , but something about watching her rap disturbs an inner accountant . Here is a person whose very first appearance in a feature film , a the unforgettable Patsey in “ 12 Years a Slave ” ( 2013 ) , made her the seventh black woman and first black African to win an Academy Award for acting ; a person whose doll-like facial symmetry and frictionless skin ha landed her four solo appearance on the cover of Vogue ; a person who speaks four language and hold a graduate degree from Yale .
 And this same person , wearing dark sunglass and facetiously calling herself Troublemaker , reveals that she also can rap , with appropriate level of insouciance and conviction , and while remaining on beat . One suspect the divine dealer of dereliction of duty .
 Nyong ’ o discussed her hip-hop hobby on an afternoon earlier this month in Austin , where she had come to the South by Southwest film festival to unveil “ Us , ” due March 22 . Like the rap video , her foray into horror represents both an abstention from , and an implicit critique of , the Hollywood playbook for star of her pedigree . Though she ha been deliberate about creating a space for herself in an industry that wasn ’ t built for her , inhabiting and defending that space is another matter . Nyong ’ o ’ s performance in “ Us , ” already earning ecstatic review , is a shot across the bow to anyone who would deny her her due .
 It wa overcast and humid . But we caught a breeze on a digressive walk around Lady Bird Lake on the edge of downtown . Nyong ’ o , who wa dressed for an earlier panel discussion in a gray and black gingham pantsuit , black heel and matching round sunglass , wa trailed by two barrel-chested bodyguard , who kept a wide berth at their client ’ s polite but firm insistence . As we wound between naked tree down a semi-paved path , more than a few rubbernecker shot her adoring grin and sheepish wave .
 Her normal life is much lower maintenance . She ’ s lived in the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn for several year , having opted to stay on the East Coast after school , and spends quiet weekend going to the farmer ’ s market , or to local restaurant , where , she said with relief , “ New Yorkers are too busy to recognize people . ”
 But such normalcy grows scarcer by the day . Nyong ’ o spent much of the last two year preparing for , shooting and promoting Marvel ’ s “ Black Panther , ” in which she played Nakia , an idealistic Wakandan spy and the hero ’ s love interest . The film ’ s worldwide success may turn the Oscar-winning actress into a blockbuster heroine , a rarefied combination that “ Us ” is positioned to affirm .
 In it , she play both Adelaide , the matriarch of the charming Wilson family , and Red , her bloodthirsty doppelgänger . Peele wrote the character with Nyong ’ o in mind , and the two were close collaborator on interpreting the script . They met for the first time shortly after Nyong ’ o wrapped “ Panther ” ( during production of that film , the actress and lifelong horror fan organized a cast field trip to see Peele ’ s surprise 2017 smash , “ Get Out ” ) and quickly hit it off .
 “ He wa really inviting of my thought and idea , ” she said . “ He ’ ll have this kernel of an idea that is so strong , and then he ’ ll keep adding to it and clarifying his intention a he go along . When he cast me in the movie , I joined him in that process . ”
 In an interview , Peele said he wa grateful for the second pair of eye . “ Right out of the gate she wa asking question about the character that I didn ’ t know the answer to — and I knew everything about them , ” he said .
 In the film ’ s story , a carefully a it can be described without spoiler , Adelaide embarks on a beachside vacation with her husband ( fellow “ Black Panther ” alumnus Winston Duke ) and their two child . It turn cataclysmic when another family of mysterious origin — their mirror image , but a filtered through a particularly ghastly nightmare — show up on their doorstep .
 Peele seeded his script with cryptic prompt for the look and feel of Adelaide ’ s evil double . One concerned Red ’ s movement , which Peele conveyed with just two exceptionally creepy word : Queen cockroach .
 Another prompt indicated that Red had a scratchy voice , a if withered from lack of use . That seed — contained in a single sentence on the page — wa fertilized when Nyong ’ o attended a fashion event where , to her surprise , she heard a speaker whose voice she thought sounded close to what Peele wa describing . The speaker wa Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , who ha spasmodic dysphonia , a neurological disorder that cause involuntary spasm of the larynx . In the film , Nyong ’ o ’ s hair-raising performance is defined by a haunting amplification of the disorder , which sound like what might happen if you swallowed a cheese grater .
 Nyong ’ o ’ s set debut in costume a Red , for a long , unbroken monologue that fill in the character ’ s life story , wa one of the most dramatic moment of the shoot .
 “ She walked into the room and you just felt the air suck out of it , ” Peele said . “ The first time she did that scene wa magic . I think we shot it like 10 time — just because we could — and it wa always gold . ”
 On the trail in Austin , Nyong ’ o wa recalling how she fell in love with acting when something — someone — broke her focus . It wa a large man in a faded T-shirt and white earbuds walking behind u , talking so loudly that we were struggling to hear one another . Nyong ’ o stopped and turned around . As the man passed by , she gave him a look of such elegant and devastating ferocity that I thought he might evaporate mid-stride , leaving only the earbuds behind . The bodyguard may not have been necessary after all .
 Her aunt had been a theater actress in Nairobi , and Nyong ’ o ’ s sibling and cousin would perform short skit at family gathering . Acting wa a way to win attention from ( and manipulate the emotion of ) her mother and father , who defied the stereotype of African parent by encouraging their child to pursue their passion .
 Both accompanied their daughter to the “ Us ” premiere . Nyong ’ o ’ s father , Peter , is a politician and the governor of Kisumu County in Kenya . As a young college professor and critic of former President Daniel arap Moi , he temporarily exiled himself and his family to Mexico City , where Nyong ’ o wa born and given a Spanish name inspired by their adopted home . Her mother , Dorothy , is a public relation consultant and the managing trustee of the Africa Cancer Foundation , founded by her husband .
 Nyong ’ o credited her mother in particular for her self-confidence .
 “ She ’ s dignified in the thing she know , and she ’ s dignified in the thing she doesn ’ t , ” she said . “ She ’ s not afraid to admit that she ha something to learn . And that quality is something that I seek to emulate — to be able to be comfortable in the discomfort of not knowing , or the feeling that you ’ re unprepared . ”
 “ Us ” is only Nyong ’ o ’ s fourth live-action appearance in a film since her debut , and a a lead actress , she is still learning how and where she want to apply herself . Many in her position would accept a much work a their schedule would bear , fearing the law of gravity that can bring Hollywood prodigy abruptly back to earth . But here , too , Nyong ’ o ha defied expectation . She belief her creativity is a finite resource and doesn ’ t offer it easily .
 “ I ’ m not creative all the time , I ’ m just not , ” she said . “ Each role depletes me in some way , and I know that I do my best work when I ’ ve had time to remain fallow . ”
 Being selective ha meant saying no to star vehicle that other actress would relish . After she won her Oscar , Nyong ’ o wa approached to headline the American remake of the Mexican action thriller “ Miss Bala , ” but ultimately decided not to move forward with the project . ( The film wa released last month starring Gina Rodriguez . )
 “ I just realized that whatever I ’ m interested in didn ’ t fit into the story , so I chose to bow out , ” Nyong ’ o said . “ I didn ’ t feel like I had the right perspective for it . ”
 Her awareness that few historical model exist for female movie star of color , particularly those with dark skin , ha made her especially mindful of the example she is setting .
 With “ Black Panther , ” Nyong ’ o wa part of a seismic shift away from whiteness a the unquestioned default in American popular cinema . “ Us , ” in which the race of the central character — though affirmatively black — is never depicted a remarkable , gave her a chance to take that shift a step further .
 “ It ’ s really not exceptional to be black , or to be African , and I think that ’ s a powerful statement in and of itself , ” she said . “ We can be seen and perceived a part and parcel of the global experience , because that is the truth . ”
 In Austin , where the sun had finally emerged , we left the lake behind and turned toward downtown , where Nyong ’ o wa due at her hotel to get dressed for the “ Us ” premiere later that night .
 Before we arrived , she told me a story about a time when she still felt beholden to the expectation of others . It wa by way of explaining her excitement over another creative coup , a both producer and star of a coming mini-series adaptation of the novel “ Americanah , ” by the Nigerian writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie .
 As a young , Kenyan-Mexican actress living and working in America , Nyong ’ o said she had made a habit of suppressing her accent , a natural composite of the place she ’ s lived .
 “ I wa only speaking in the American accent , because my feeling , and the feeling that wa communicated to me in school , wa that having an African accent would limit your possibility , ” she said .
 After she wrapped “ 12 Years a Slave , ” newly facing the prospect of a public life , the inauthenticity of her voice became a source of anxiety . Encouragement came from a novel Nyong ’ o wa reading at the time , “ Americanah , ” in which the main character , Ifemelu , is a Nigerian immigrant who also attends an Ivy League school and also ha given up her natural tongue .
 Burdened eventually with shame and regret , longing to be seen — and heard — a her ordinarily extraordinary self , Ifemelu giddily repents .
 “ I remember I wa on the subway when I wa reading that , ” Nyong ’ o said . “ I just wept . ”

 A new research paper tracked the political donation of thousand of C.E.O.s from 2000 through 2017 . The result , Andrew writes in his latest column , reveal what top business leader really think about politics .
 They ’ re usually Republican . Nearly 58 percent of C.E.O.s showed a preference for the G.O.P. , with just 18 percent designated a Democrats . ( For executive to be counted a either , two third of their donation had to go to candidate affiliated with one party . )
 About a quarter were considered neutral . The report doesn ’ t disclose who wa in each category , but it author told Andrew that Tim Cook of Apple wa neutral , having donated to both Hillary Clinton and Paul Ryan over the year .
 The disparity wa narrower in some sector . Tech and internet company had somewhat more Democratic-leaning C.E.O.s . And female leader were nearly evenly split between the G.O.P. , Democrats and neutral territory .
 But the Republicans are quieter . The study found that there wa a statistically significant association between a company having a Republican C.E.O . and le disclosure of political contribution .
 Why it matter : “ The opinion held by executive have always resonated beyond their own industry , but their importance is more pronounced today , ” Andrew writes . “ Mr . Trump , for example , ha not hesitated to equate economic policy with foreign policy . It is , then , instructive to understand the political view of our business leader . ”
 The U.S. and China will embark on another round of high-level trade talk in a final attempt to hash out an agreement , according to the WSJ .
 • “ U.S . Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin plan to fly to Beijing next week to meet with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He , Trump administration official said . ”
 • “ The following week , a Chinese delegation led by Mr. Liu is expected to continue talk in Washington . ”
 There are conflicting view on how far they ’ ve got :
 America seems upbeat . President Trump yesterday said that talk were “ going very well , ” and Myron Brilliant , executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , said that “ we ’ re in the endgame . ”
 But China may be wary . “ Some U.S. negotiator are concerned that China is pushing back against American demand in trade talk , ” Bloomberg report , citing unnamed source . It may walk back some promise because they didn ’ t prompt assurance about American concession .
 A deal could be ready by the end of April if the next talk go well , the WSJ estimate , about a month later than previously expected .
 Meanwhile , in Europe : President Xi Jinping ’ s trip to Italy and France this week is drawing attention to Europe ’ s conflicted view on China .
 After year of criticism , Facebook said it would no longer permit advertiser in key category to show their message only to people of a certain race , gender or age group , Noam Scheiber and Mike Isaac of the NYT report .
 • Anyone advertising housing , job or credit would no longer have the option of explicitly aiming ad on the basis of those characteristic .
 • The new rule also cover advertising on Instagram and Messenger , which Facebook owns .
 • Facebook said it planned to carry out the change by the end of the year .
 • The change are part of a settlement with group that have sued Facebook over these practice in recent year .
 The shift will annoy advertiser . Sheryl Sandberg , Facebook ’ s C.O.O. , told the NYT that the change could make advertising on Facebook le efficient for some customer , but that it wa “ a cost well worth bearing . ”
 And it ha limit . “ I don ’ t think it solves the problem of the potential for biased serving of ad , ” Pauline Kim , a professor of employment law at Washington University in St. Louis , told the NYT . She explained that Facebook ’ s algorithm could show any ad to a particular audience if that audience were determined to be likelier to click on it .
 More Facebook news : Representative David Cicilline , the head of the House antitrust subcommittee , explains why he is calling on the F.T.C . to investigate the company . And are we asking it the wrong question in the wake of the Christchurch shooting ?
 In the wake of two fatal crash involving Boeing ’ s 737 Max 8 plane , a new focus for investigation is how the F.A.A . certified the jet a safe , David Gelles and Tom Kaplan of the NYT report .
 • “ The 737 Max wa one of the first commercial jet approved under new rule , which delegated more authority to Boeing than had been the case when most previous plane were certified . ”
 • “ Top F.A.A . official , who are briefed on significant safety issue , were not aware ” of an automated piloting system suspected in the crash , Mr. Gelles and Mr. Kaplan report , citing unnamed source .
 • “ The software did not elicit what are known a special condition , usually applied to a novel feature that requires additional regulation before it can be certified a safe. ” But other feature , like non-rechargeable lithium battery , received that designation .
 • Skepticism about the F.A.A. ’ s approval process existed before the crash . “ In 2012 , an investigation by the Transportation Department ’ s Office of Inspector General found that F.A.A . manager had not always been supportive of effort by agency employee to ‘ hold Boeing accountable . ’ ”
 • “ The United States transportation secretary , Elaine L. Chao , on Tuesday called for her agency ’ s internal watchdog to open an inquiry into the process . ”
 More aviation news : President Trump nominated Stephen Dickson , a former Delta Air Lines executive , to lead the F.A.A . And an off-duty pilot reportedly helped save a Lion Air 737 Max 8 flight in software-driven trouble just one day before the same jet crashed .
 The tech giant introduced a service yesterday that allows people to play high-definition game instantly over the internet . It ’ s hoping to lead a revolution in the $ 135 billion industry .
 Think of it a Netflix for video game . “ The new service , called Stadia , will work for anyone with a fast internet connection and a computer , phone or tablet , ” Daisuke Wakabayashi and Brian Chen of the NYT write . “ Users pay a subscription to access a library of game that they can immediately play , a opposed to the traditional model of paying for a disc or waiting to download a game . ”
 This isn ’ t the only game-streaming option . Sony offer one called PlayStation Now , and Microsoft plan to test something similar this year . The idea hasn ’ t yet hit the mainstream because streaming game is more technically demanding than streaming movie — and therefore prone to glitch .
 Plenty of unanswered question hang over the announcement . What game will be available ? How much will the service cost ? And more fundamentally , what is Google ’ s business model ? None of that is clear .
 But Google ha not-so-secret weapon . “ Using the global network of data center that run it internet empire , it is set to unleash enough raw computing power to blow away the industry ’ s current way of doing thing , ” the FT writes , and it ha “ YouTube a a shop window. ” Shares in Sony and Nintendo tumbled after the announcement .
 More Google news : In Europe , the company is changing how it display some search result , and is giving Android user a choice of web browser to stave off complaint — and potential fine — from antitrust regulator .
 Just after midnight Eastern Time , Walt Disney closed it $ 71.3 billion takeover of 21st Century Fox . It ha become , Brooks Barnes of the NYT writes , “ an entertainment colossus the size of which the world ha never seen . ”
 Disney now owns an enviable array of asset . It already run blockbuster property like Marvel , Lucasfilm and ESPN , and a huge global theme-park operation . But buying most of Rupert Murdoch ’ s medium empire brings :
 • The 20th Century Fox movie and TV studio , home to “ X-Men ” and “ The Simpsons ”
 • The Nat Geo and FX cable channel
 • Most of the Hulu streaming service
 • Star , the fast-growing Indian video provider
 The consequence could be huge . Smaller studio may have to merge . Theater owner could lose out on box-office split . And Disney ’ s effort to dominate streaming could pose big challenge to Netflix , Amazon and Apple .
 But the stake are high . “ Mr . Iger and his lieutenant need to persuade investor to start viewing Disney more like a technology company , where near-term financial turbulence is often overlooked , ” Mr. Barnes writes . And melding two corporate culture isn ’ t easy .
 Anheuser-Busch InBev named Marty Barrington , the former C.E.O . of Altria , a it new chairman . Alex Behring , the head of the investment firm 3G Capital , stepped down from the board .
 Paul Ryan , the former House speaker , ha joined the board of Fox .
 WarnerMedia named Toby Emmerich , Peter Roth and Kimberly Williams a interim co-heads of Warner Bros. while it seek a replacement for Kevin Tsujihara .
 Kickstarter ’ s co-founder Perry Chen is stepping down a C.E.O .

 LAKE FOREST , Ill. — During practice last Thursday afternoon , Tarik Cohen caught a punt . Still clutching the ball , he proceeded to catch another . And another . And another . And another . And another .
 And another .
 By the end of this wacky experiment , Cohen wa cradling seven ball — one , roughly , for every role he ha with the Chicago Bears .
 Cohen is — O.K. , deep breath — the Bears ’ handoff-taking , punt-returning , ball-catching , pass-throwing , mismatch-creating , gasp-inducing , highlight-monopolizing cyborg . A year after becoming the first rookie since Gale Sayers , a former Bear , in 1965 , to contribute touchdown by running , receiving , passing and punt return , Cohen ha further obliterated concern that a 5-foot-6 running back from the humble Football Championship Subdivision would struggle transitioning to the N.F.L. ’ s rugged N.F.C . North .
 [ Wild-Card Weekend : Our Predictions for the N.F.L . Playoffs ]
 If the quarterback-wrecking edge rusher Khalil Mack embodies a defense that ha fueled the Bears ’ worst-to-first ascent — a the N.F.C. ’ s third seed , they ’ ll face the No . 6-seeded Eagles in the wild-card round on Sunday , their first playoff appearance since 2010 — Cohen personifies the offense installed by the team ’ s first-year coach , Matt Nagy : creative , unpredictable and , at time , downright fun . Nagy ha maximized Cohen ’ s speed , suddenness and receiving skill by aligning him around the formation , from the backfield to the inside to the outside , turning him into , in effect , Chicago ’ s offensive version of Mack : the player opponent must stalk wherever he is on the field . He led the team in catch ( 71 ) , yard from scrimmage ( 1,169 ) and all-purpose yardage ( 1,599 ) , and wa voted onto the All-Pro team a punt returner .
 “ He ’ s got a lot of strength and not a lot of weakness , ” Nagy said . “ Having him be a part of what we do and what we scheme is a huge advantage . ”
 Soon after the Bears hired Nagy away from Kansas City , where he served for five season on Andy Reid ’ s staff , Cohen heard that last season the Chiefs featured three player who gained more than 1,000 yard : receiver Tyreek Hill , tight end Travis Kelce and running back Kareem Hunt . Cohen did not know when or how he would get the ball in Chicago , he said , only that he would .
 “ Get me the ball and get me in space , ” Cohen said .
 That just might be his motto . His 170 touch rank second on the team , behind Jordan Howard , the primary rusher . As a runner , Cohen ha the seventh-best breakaway percentage in the N.F.L. , gaining 44.4 percent of his 444 yard on carry of at least 15 yard , according to Pro Football Focus . As a receiver , Cohen average 10.2 yard per reception , most among the 20 back with at least 40 catch , according to Pro Football Reference .
 As the position ha evolved , a hybridized strain of running back ha permeated the league , player a comfortable with , and capable of , lining up in the slot or being split wide a they are rushing 20 time per game . Cohen doe not run a often a other versatile second-year dynamo like the Panthers ’ Christian McCaffrey or the Saints ’ Alvin Kamara , but his proficiency in the passing game — his 175 snap away from the backfield were the most among running back — ha made him , according to Pro Football Focus ’ s Wins Above Replacement metric , the second-most valuable player at his position , just behind McCaffrey .
 “ I don ’ t think there ’ s anything he can ’ t do , ” Bears running back Benny Cunningham said .
 The Bears ’ vast playbook — Minnesota Vikings Coach Mike Zimmer quipped earlier this season that it contained 800 play — demand Cohen know entire passing concept because any week he could line up at four or five different spot . His first-year position coach , Charles London , marveled early on at Cohen ’ s savvy — how he can see a drawing or a video of a play and master his responsibility on the field in a repetition or two . His improvement a a blocker ha helped Chicago disguise it call , diminishing tendency that his alignment might have tipped off .
 “ There ’ s not really a route — at running back or receiver — that he can ’ t run in this offense , ” London said .
 That wa Cohen ’ s objective during the off-season , he said , when he devoted two day a week to refining route that come back to the ball , like curl , during seven-on-seven drill with his former North Carolina A & T teammate . He did not want to be branded a only a deep-ball threat , just a he doe not want to be perceived a strictly a perimeter runner , someone unwilling — or worse , not stout enough — to run between the tackle .
 Further evidence : Ask Cohen his top play from this season , and he mention not the 70-yard screen against the Jets , the 50-yard catch-and-dash at Miami or the overtime-forcing touchdown toss at the Giants . In his mind , all the feint , cutback and burst that evoke his favorite player , Reggie Bush , do not compare to the punt he fielded midway through the first quarter against New England in Week 7 , when he stepped left , cut right , then zipped left again , shedding a tackle at his foot before encountering a defender by the boundary squaring up to level him .
 The contact wa brief . The defender crumpled . Cohen did not .
 “ Somebody so small running somebody big over — it make everybody ’ s day , ” Cohen said .
 Cohen is short but , listed at 181 pound , not small . He is thick and sturdy , with disproportionately enormous hand — size 10⅛ from thumb to pinkie , bigger than those of hulking receiving threat like Kelce , Julio Jones and A.J . Green — that help him do thing like , say , hold on to seven ball at the same time .
 Growing up in rural Bunn , N.C. , about 30 mile northeast of Raleigh , Cohen specialized in such exploit . For one , he developed his speed — like another Bears playmaker before him — through unorthodox method . Instead of running through tall , thick grass , a Devin Hester did , Cohen dodged the pit bull that he said roamed his neighborhood .
 “ It ’ s fight or flight , ” Cohen said . “ Either get going or you ’ re going to get eat , so you ’ ve got to get out of there . ”
 He did get out of there — to play football , but barely . Had North Carolina A & T , a historically black university , not offered him a scholarship , Cohen would have joined the Navy .
 Why ?
 “ I knew how to swim , ” said Cohen , sitting in the Halas Hall lobby before practice one day last week . “ And it wasn ’ t like people were getting killed in the Navy . ”
 Rather than enlist , Cohen opted to dominate the F.C.S . Across his four season at A & T , he rushed for a Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference record 5,619 yard , the 10th-most in the history of what wa formerly Division I-AA . But when N.F.L . scout passed through Greensboro , said Shawn Gibbs , his position coach at A & T , some seemed unconvinced .
 “ They just tried to poke hole in everything he did — like , he ’ s good , but , ” Gibbs said . “ The guy that were like : ‘ Man , this guy can walk under this table . I can ’ t take him to my G.M. ’ Those were the guy that were frustrating . ”
 It wa the Bears ’ good fortune that their scout who prowl the Southeast , Sam Summerville , attended a historically black college himself . Before even studying Cohen , Summerville admired him a a fan , watching from afar a he rushed for 295 yard — and touchdown of 74 , 83 and 73 yard — against Alcorn State in the Celebration Bowl .
 The deeper he probed , the more Summerville believed in Cohen . Not a a gadget player , but a an N.F.L . running back . At Summerville ’ s urging , the Bears deployed additional scout to evaluate him , and they , too , grew enamored . Still , a they prepped for the 2017 draft , Summerville expected pushback — for everything from Cohen ’ s statistic , perceived to be inflated by the lesser competition , to his stature . So he relied on emotion a much a reason to convey why they needed him .
 In an impassioned plea , Summerville showed his colleague the clip of Cohen catching two ball while doing a back flip . ( Yes , really . ) He affirmed that rival coach feared no player more than Cohen . He explained that of the 350 to 400 player he assessed in the fall of 2016 , Cohen wa “ definitely ” his favorite .
 “ It got to the point where some of the other scout may have been rolling their eye a little bit , like , ‘ this guy ’ s serious , ’ ” Summerville said . “ Every time I opened my mouth about him , or every time a question wa asked , they were like , ‘ Do you think this guy can do this ? ’ Tarik can do pretty much everything you ask him to . ”
 The Bears chose Cohen with one of their fourth-round selection — they took another foundational player , safety Eddie Jackson , seven pick earlier — and before he even took a snap , Cunningham exhorted his friend to draft him for their fantasy football team . Many satisfied customer , he said .
 Over the summer , Summerville reviewed his report on Cohen , to check whether reality matched projection . It did not . Cohen surpassed them . One after another after another after another .
 And another .

 Uber published the prospectus yesterday for it long-awaited I.P.O. , revealing the full scale of it ride-hailing empire — and potential warning sign for what is expected to be the biggest market debut in year .
 The main revelation :
 • $ 1.8 billion in loss last year , excluding gain from selling part of it business in Southeast Asia and Russia .
 • $ 11.3 billion in overall revenue .
 • 91 million monthly user , including service like food delivery and shared scooter and bike rental .
 • Its biggest shareholder include SoftBank of Japan and it co-founder and former C.E.O. , Travis Kalanick .
 Growth is slowing . In 2018 , revenue rose 42 percent from a year earlier . It had doubled the year before . And revenue from ride-hailing , it biggest business , wa roughly flat for the last six month of 2018 . Growth in monthly user also appears to be slowing .
 That could be a concern for investor who had hoped Uber would maintain a meteoric growth rate . A potential $ 100 billion valuation may be lower than expectation , but Lex point out that it ’ s still a rich number .
 More : How Uber stack up against Lyft . What Uber ’ s metric like “ core platform contribution margin ” actually mean . And Uber executive stand to make huge bonus from a big I.P.O . — it driver , not so much .
 Chevron said this morning that it planned to acquire Anadarko , the oil and gas producer , in what would be one of the biggest deal in the industry in year .
 • Under the term of the deal , Chevron would pay $ 65 a share in stock and cash . That is 39 percent above where Anadarko ’ s stock closed yesterday .
 • Including Anadarko ’ s debt , the transaction is valued at $ 50 billion .
 • Anadarko would give Chevron a huge presence in the Permian Basin in West Texas , one of the most valuable oil-producing area in the U.S . It would also strengthen Chevron ’ s liquid natural gas reserve .
 If completed , the deal would be Chevron ’ s biggest since it $ 36 billion takeover of Texaco , which closed in 2001 .
 The deal come a oil price have risen over the past six week after a reduction in supply by OPEC member . Futures for West Texas Intermediate crude reached $ 64.19 per barrel this morning , up 61 cent from their last closing price , according to Reuters .
 In Amazon ’ s annual letter to it shareholder , Jeff Bezos shared insight about the financial performance of his e-commerce behemoth .
 “ Third-party seller are kicking our first-party butt . Badly , ” Mr. Bezos wrote . Third-party sale on Amazon increased to $ 160 billion in 2018 from $ 100 million in 1999 — a compound annual growth rate of 52 percent . Amazon ’ s first-party sale rose to $ 117 billion from $ 1.6 billion in the same period , a growth rate of 25 percent .
 Growth in Amazon ’ s total merchandise sale is slowing , according to calculation by Shira Ovide of Bloomberg Opinion . She writes that the company sold $ 300 billion worth of merchandise in 2018 , up 19 percent from the previous year . But annual increase for that metric were 24 percent for 2017 and 27 percent for 2016 .
 “ It ’ s unfair to expect Amazon to grow like a start-up forever . But it ’ s not insignificant that this slowdown ha come even a Amazon ha attempted to flex more muscle in newer category , ” Ms. Ovide writes . “ It doesn ’ t seem like a coincidence that this come a it legacy retail competitor finally seem to have awakened and adapted to the e-commerce era . ”
 More : Mr. Bezos also dared retail rival to raise their minimum wage . A Walmart executive shot back by asking Amazon to pay tax .
 Four Republican senator said that they would not back Mr. Cain should President Trump nominate him a a Fed governor . That ’ s probably enough opposition to stop him from joining the central bank .
 “ If I had to vote today , I would vote no , ” Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said yesterday , joining Mitt Romney of Utah , Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Cory Gardner of Colorado in opposing Mr. Cain . They appear to have concern about his qualification and partisanship .
 Because Republicans hold only 53 Senate seat , a confirmation would require support from Democrats . That seems unlikely , given Mr. Cain ’ s frequent attack on opposition lawmaker .
 It ’ s unclear whether Mr. Trump ’ s other pick for the Fed , the economics commentator Stephen Moore , will fare better . Mr. Moore ha been embarrassed by revelation of tax problem , but Jim Tankersley of the NYT report that he may win wider support from Senate Republicans .
 Mr. Trump ’ s effort to politicize the Fed continue to outrage commentator . The Economist is worried that “ the Fed will become a political weapon , and that America will move closer to becoming a nation where the welfare of the ruling party trump that of the country a a whole . ”
 As part of trade negotiation with America , China ha offered new concession on access in the cloud-computing sector for U.S. tech company , the WSJ report .
 • China is “ proposing to issue more license that business need to operate data center and to lift the 50 percent equity cap that limit ownership for certain foreign cloud-service provider , ” according to unidentified source .
 • “ Amazon , Microsoft , Apple and others have invested million of dollar or more to provide cloud service in China , but are hampered by regulation . Better access would potentially allow them to enlarge their presence . ”
 • “ Questions still remain over the detail of the latest Chinese proposal , the people said , such a how quickly the equity cap would be removed , and whether the removal would be confined to certain geographical area , such a a free-trade zone . ”
 Both Washington and Beijing are offering a final round of concession , hoping they will lead to an agreement . President Trump said last week that he expected to reach a deal within the next four week .
 The owner of The National Enquirer may have found a potential buyer : Ron Burkle , the supermarket mogul , the NYT report .
 Mr. Burkle is known for buying distressed company , having made his fortune through buying and merging supermarket chain like Ralphs and Jurgensen ’ s . He ’ s also known for hobnobbing with celebrity like Leonardo DiCaprio and Madonna .
 He ’ s also a big donor to the Democratic Party , and wa close to President Bill Clinton . That would make his owning The Enquirer , the tabloid favored by Mr. Trump , unusual . ( He is also friend with Mr . Trump . )
 But leak of the Enquirer talk may scuttle a deal . After the NYT reported on the discussion , a spokesman for Mr. Burkle ’ s private equity firm said that the investor wasn ’ t in talk to buy the publication . The NYT report that Mr. Burkle ’ s team felt “ used ” by American Media Inc. , the tabloid ’ s current owner .
 The WikiLeaks founder wa arrested yesterday in London to face a charge in the U.S. of conspiring to hack into a Pentagon computer network in 2010 , the NYT report .
 • “ The Ecuadorean government suspended the citizenship it had granted Mr. Assange and evicted him on Thursday , clearing the way for his arrest . ”
 • “ At a court hearing , a judge swiftly found him guilty of jumping bail , and he wa detained partly in connection with an American extradition warrant . ”
 • “ Mr . Assange indicated that he would fight extradition , and legal expert said that process could take year . He is likely to argue that the case is politically motivated . ”
 The event brought to a head issue about press freedom . Mr. Assange ’ s work with WikiLeaks — obtaining and publishing information that official would prefer be kept secret — are hard to legally distinguish from journalism . Some fear that journalist could be treated in a similar way .
 Mr. Assange wa indicted on a charge of hacking , not publishing secret . But people who are worried about press freedom shouldn ’ t necessarily rest easy , Charlie Savage of the NYT writes .
 More : President Trump once claimed to “ love WikiLeaks. ” Yesterday , he said : “ I know nothing about WikiLeaks . It ’ s not my thing . ”
 The dust ha settled on the agreement to delay Britain ’ s withdrawal from the E.U . for at least six month . But reaction to the situation have been mixed .
 Business are unhappy . For many larger company , Brexit ha already happened . But “ business of all size are still pleading for Parliament to give them clarity before the economy slows , ” Amie Tsang of the NYT writes .
 Economists are pleased . The I.M.F. ’ s managing director , Christine Lagarde , said that the new Brexit date meant that Britain would avoid — for now — the “ terrible outcome ” of a no-deal departure . The Bank of England governor , Mark Carney , said the delay would make a no-deal exit le disruptive .
 And Prime Minister Theresa May is pushing on . She ha “ renewed her effort to push through her Brexit deal with the aid of the opposition Labour Party , in a desperate bid to avoid holding European parliamentary election in a month ’ s time , ” according to the FT .
 Bob Iger said yesterday that he would retire a Walt Disney ’ s C.E.O . in 2021 .
 Jamie Forese , the head of Citigroup ’ s investment bank and a potential successor to Mike Corbat a C.E.O. , is stepping down .
 Google ’ s chief diversity officer , Danielle Brown , is leaving to become the human resource chief at Gusto .
 Maryanne Trump Barry , a federal appellate judge in Philadelphia and the sister of President Trump , ha retired amid a civil misconduct investigation .

 Letter 92
 By Damien Cave
 The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau chief . Sign up to get it by email .
 This week , we have a special treat : Karen Crouse , one of our sportswriter who wa here for the Australian Open , spent time with Briony Lyle , the wife of Jarrod Lyle , one of Australia ’ s most beloved golfer , who died of cancer a few month ago .
 He wa only 36 . Here ’ s his New York Times obituary if you missed it .
 We ’ ve turned the newsletter over to Karen and Briony , for insight on sport and life . Tell u what you think at nytaustralia @ nytimes.com .
 ___
 Briony Lyle laugh when she think about it now , but in the day after her husband , Jarrod , died following a lengthy battle with leukemia , she wondered what she would do with herself . For nearly a decade , her day had revolved around Jarrod ’ s schedule , first a a professional golfer and , later a a second-and-third-time cancer patient .
 Jarrod ’ s death last August at age 36 unleashed a global outpouring of emotion and support from people whose life he touched or who were touched by the story of a seemingly regular bloke who had absorbed life ’ s — and golf ’ s — bad break with grit and good cheer .
 At the time I marveled at how a group of athlete who tend to measure success so rigidly , who generally buy into the belief that they are what their score say they are , rallied to give a farewell befitting a giant to Jarrod , a journeyman whose highest finish in 121 P.G.A . Tour start wa a tie for fourth .
 Curious to know what life wa like for Briony after the elegy stopped , I followed the Australia Day migration of beachgoers to Torquay , the gateway to the Great Ocean Road , where Briony and Jarrod moved in 2012 and where , she said , Jarrod peacefully passed his final day .
 The half-year anniversary of Jarrod ’ s death wa upon her , but that ’ s not why Briony saw reminder of her husband everywhere .
 The day before , an American , Bryson DeChambeau , had claimed a seven-stroke victory at the Dubai Desert Classic , a European Tour event . Briony ha never met the 25-year-old DeChambeau , but at the P.G.A . Championship , held the week after Jarrod ’ s death , DeChambeau won a long-driving contest and donated the $ 25,000 winner ’ s check to an education fund set up for the Lyles ’ s young daughter , Lusi , 6 , and Jemma , 2 .
 Since then , Briony , who never really cared for golf , ha been a huge fan of DeChambeau . She recently sent him a thank-you note , which began the same a hundred of others that she had written over the past few month : “ We may never meet , but what you did wa so amazing , just to say thank you is not enough . ”
 This week in the United States , the P.G.A . Tour is outside Phoenix , for a tournament known for it party atmosphere , huge crowd and stadium-style 16th hole .
 The par 3 ha been the scene of nine ace , including one by Tiger Woods and another by Jarrod in what wa perhaps the signature moment of his P.G.A . Tour career .
 It happened during the second round of the 2011 event , and Jarrod ’ s reaction wa almost a memorable a a result . While the shot wa airborne , he made the motion to sit with both hand a if his golf ball were a puppy at obedience school . After the ball bounced on the green and rolled in the cup , he pumped his arm multiple time , then windmilled his arm to churn the already raucous crowd of more than 25,000 into even more of a lather .
 Smiling ear to ear , he ran over to his caddie shouting , “ You beauty , ” only , in typical Jarrod fashion , with an expletive added for emphasis .
 Briony said Jarrod replayed the video of the shot and his reaction hundred of time over the year .
 “ He ’ d tell people not to believe all the view it ha gotten because he ’ s been responsible for most of them , ” she said . “ People thought he wa just being humble , but he wa telling the truth . ”
 She laughed .
 “ He watched that video all the time . I can remember waking up to him giggling and I ’ d ask him what he wa laughing at and he ’ d say , ‘ I just watched the hole-in-one again . ’ ”
 Golf did not captivate Briony , who wa a high school classmate of Jarrod ’ s in their hometown , Shepparton , in northern Victoria . When they started dating a few year later , she attended his tournament but recognized early on that she wa going to need a diversion .
 “ I couldn ’ t possibly spend my time walking aimlessly around golf course pretending I wa invested in every shot and every moment , ” said Briony , who enrolled in class in Melbourne to become a massage therapist . She accumulated her required training hour , she said , by setting up a massage table at tournament and kneading the muscle of the caddy .
 She earned her certification in 2012 , shortly before giving birth to the couple ’ s first daughter , Lusi . Another daughter , Jemma , arrived four year later . Around the time of Lusi ’ s birth , Jarrod learned that the leukemia he had battled successfully in high school had returned .
 He wa off the P.G.A . Tour for more than two year , then came back and made 20 more start . He had returned to Australia to play his home tour and try his hand at broadcasting when he found out in late 2017 that the leukemia had returned a third time .
 During his initial battle with the disease , Jarrod became acquainted with Challenge , a nonprofit dedicated to providing practical and personalized service to the family of cancer patient . The organization ’ s mascot is a duck named Leuk , and since Jarrod ’ s death people from all over the world have snatched up Leuk merchandise , everything from duck head cover to pin and ball marker .
 Next week top performer from the P.G.A . Tour of Australasia , the Australian Ladies Professional Golf , the European Tour and the Ladies European Tour will converge on Barwon Heads Golf Club , not far from Torquay , for the Vic Open . Briony will be there , selling Leuk the Duck merchandise to raise money for family dealing with cancer .
 “ I have my moment — many , many moment — mostly nighttime where I can ’ t sleep because of thing playing over in my mind , ” Briony said . “ But I ’ m able to grab on to this incredible thing that came out of what happened , there ’ s so much good that came out of it and I ’ m just so determined to draw attention to this cause because I ’ m not unique , unfortunately . ”
 A bittersweet thing happened ; she lost her golfer husband and found a calling that drew her deeper into golf .
 “ After he died , I kept telling people over and over , my life tended to revolve around Jarrod either in illness or career and now my life continues to revolve around him , ” she said . “ That ’ s the legacy . ”
 — Karen Crouse

 HANCOCK , N.Y. — Deep in the dense wood near the Catskill Mountains , a settlement wa started decade ago by Muslim family , many of them African-Americans from New York City , who were seeking to distance themselves from neighborhood they saw a dangerous and laden with corrosive influence . Holy Islamberg wa intended to be a refuge , a serene environment to pray and bring up child .
 In the year since , the enclave ’ s resident have forged relationship with state and local law enforcement , and made connection with their non-Muslim neighbor from nearby town . They work alongside each other in medical clinic and office . Their child are teammate in youth football and basketball game .
 But resident of Islamberg have found that there is no such thing a a safe haven in the internet age .
 Conspiracy theorist and anti-Muslim group have sketched a false portrayal of the community a a hidden-away den of Islamic extremism . Last week , the police in Greece , N.Y. , roughly 200 mile away , arrested four young people who are accused of amassing a stockpile of firearm and homemade bomb with plan to target the community .
 The plot wa the second major one on Islamberg to be thwarted by the authority in recent year .
 The threatened violence reflects how Islamberg ha become fodder for a pernicious part of the internet , one steeped in virulent hate and misinformation spread by website like 4chan and Infowars , alongside baseless theory like Pizzagate and QAnon .
 “ These kid in Greece , they ’ ve never been to Islamberg , ” said Hussein Adams , chief executive of the Muslims of America and a resident whose family ha lived in the community for three generation . “ They go on the internet and they ’ re fed all this fake news and all this misinformation , and they come up with a plan . ”
 Mr. Adams and other resident said they subscribe to a faith based on love and respect .
 And the local authority said the swirl of online conspiracy theory about Islamberg were unfounded .
 “ They are law-abiding , ” said Maj. William F. McEvoy , the State Police commander in the region . “ They are positive , solid member of the community . ”
 Islamberg ha about 200 resident , some from family who have lived here for two or more generation , and cover some 60 acre outside Binghamton , near the Pennsylvania state line and about 150 mile from New York City . It is set back off a bumpy road on private property , up steep slope , past pasture and alongside a creek .
 The winter condition can be punishing , with snow and ice making the community even harder to reach . Still , resident have a spread of land offering enough room to build home and a mosque and raise livestock and crop .
 Islamberg wa started around 1980 by a group of mostly African-Americans who converted to Islam in the 1960s and followed Sheihk Mubarik Ali Shah Gilani , a Pakistani cleric and founder of Muslims of America .
 He encouraged his follower to flee large city and build commune in rural area where they could separate themselves from the crime and the violence they faced in their old neighborhood and the decadence that , in his view , pervaded secular society . Over the year , his follower have set up about a dozen other village similar to Islamberg , including one in Virginia , Georgia and Tennessee .
 The presence of a largely black community whose member wear Muslim garb ha been conspicuous in the nearby small town like Hancock that are populated with mostly white resident . Their arrival more than 30 year ago came with tension , but over time , the relationship warmed a resident of Islamberg became enmeshed in the broader community .
 “ We ’ ve never had a problem , ” said Nancy Furdock , who ha lived in Hancock — “ two mountain over ” from Islamberg , she said — for nearly two decade and ha become friendly with people who live in the enclave .
 She corrected herself slightly , “ We have a problem with outsider . ”
 “ Why don ’ t they come talk to u ? ” she added , referring to those who circulate conspiracy theory about Islamberg online . “ We ’ ll tell you what ’ s going on , which is nothing . ”
 In recent year , far-right Facebook group have warned of an encampment governed by an oppressive form of Shariah law , which they claimed would encroach on broader society .
 Documentary-style video portrayed Islamberg a a jihadi training camp and terrorist sleeper cell , and people who present themselves a national security expert have published report online alleging a culture of “ militant brainwashing , ” forced marriage and doling out lash and other form of draconian abuse for violating it rule .
 The community ’ s critic seized upon an arrest , in 2017 , of a 64-year-old man accused of stealing ammunition in nearby Johnson City , which led the authority to find a storage locker stocked with powerful weapon .
 Officials said at the time they had found “ no indication there wa a plan in place to commit an act of violence. ” Still , the case served a fodder for purveyor of disinformation , who peddled false story claiming the weapon were bound for Islamberg , that President Trump had ordered a raid and that investigator had uncovered “ America ’ s WORST Nightmare . ”
 Trespassers have been found attempting to sneak into the community or to fly drone over the property to conduct their own investigation . And a recurring ride of bikers ha rumbled past Islamberg ’ s entrance in a caravan to alert the community to their vigilance .
 “ I don ’ t believe the people inside here are peaceful and are standing for the same thing we stand for , ” Joseph Glasgow , an organizer of the demonstration , called a “ ride for national security , ” told the crowd that had assembled in a parking lot before setting off for Islamberg in 2017 .
 The speculation about terrorism ha inspired more than protest . In 2017 , a Tennessee man , Robert Doggart , wa sentenced to nearly 20 year in prison over a plot to recruit a militia and storm the enclave . In a phone call recorded a part of a federal wiretap , Mr. Doggart said , “ I don ’ t want to have to kill child , but there ’ s always collateral damage . ”
 The most recent threat of violence came last week after investigator in Greece , outside Rochester , thwarted an apparent plan concocted by a group who , official said , had stockpiled 23 firearm and three homemade bomb .
 Three men — Vincent Vetromile , 19 , Brian Colaneri , 20 , and Andrew Crysel , 18 — were arrested and charged with criminal possession of a weapon and conspiracy , and a fourth person , whose identity wa not released because he or she is a minor , wa charged a an adolescent with the same offense .
 It is unclear how the individual were connected , but three of them had been Boy Scouts . In the day before the plot wa uncovered , at least one of them , Mr. Vetromile , shared far-right meme and conspiracy theory about border security and a government scheme to seize weapon . The authority also said that the defendant had corresponded using Discord , a group chat app created for video gamers that became popular with far-right activist .
 Mr. Vetromile and Mr. Colaneri remain in custody , according to jail record .
 “ Just imagine having to wake up and tell your child of such a plot , tell your child that their life wa in danger , ” said Rashid Clark , Islamberg ’ s mayor .
 Much of the scrutiny directed at Islamberg center on the community ’ s tie to Mr. Gilani , an elusive figure who became more widely known after the 2002 murder of The Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl in Pakistan . Mr. Pearl , who wa reporting on a story about the so-called shoe bomber , Richard C. Reid , wa seeking an interview with the sheikh when he wa abducted . ( The sheikh is not believed to have been involved in the plot , counterterrorism analyst said . )
 Suspicion ha also sprung from the community ’ s purported association with an obscure Muslim group called Jamaat al-Fuqra , which is tied to the sheikh and ha drawn the notice of law enforcement in the United States because of accusation of criminal activity beginning in the 1980s .
 In 2002 , after the gun-charge arrest of three people who the authority said were part of Jamaat al-Fuqra , federal prosecutor described a “ history of violence ” involving the organization , including firebombings and murder . Islamberg ’ s leader have denied a connection to the group .
 And an analysis published in 2008 in the CTC Sentinel , a journal published by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point , concluded that there wa no evidence proving Islamberg wa part of a covert training operation . Instead , the report said , neither “ the presence of weapon ( or even arsenal ) , nor weapon training are particularly unusual phenomenon in rural America . ”
 The right-wing interest reflects “ a certain amount of obsession that I don ’ t see how it ’ s possibly justified , ” William Rosenau , one of the author of the Sentinel analysis , said last week . “ I think the fact that the member are Muslim and almost all African-American is a source of a lot of the anxiety . I think it ’ s straight up religious and racial fear . ”
 Major McEvoy , the State Police commander in the region , said the story of Islamberg reminded him of his own : His mother had moved their family from Brooklyn to Binghamton for a change .
 “ They believe in education , ” Major McEvoy said . “ They believe in hard work . They believe in raising their child with those goal in mind . ”
 A day after the most recent plot emerged , nudging Islamberg back under the glare of outside attention , community official organized a news conference in a hotel ballroom in Binghamton . There , it leader once again had to challenge falsehood about them .
 “ Beautiful place to live , beautiful people to live with , ” said Cassandra Greene , who wa among the earliest arrival to Islamberg more than 30 year ago .
 After the news conference , Mr. Adams of Muslims of America marveled at his community ’ s resilience . He said he believed that the alarm and cynicism that ha surrounded Islamberg had not seeped inside the community .
 Indeed , he said , Islamberg ha remained very much the same place his parent had sought , with tranquillity among resident and the latitude to live out their faith . To him , that wa most evident in the morning . The community rise well before sunrise . People wash their body and put on clean clothes and perfume . They step outside , on the land where they hunt and raise much of their own food .
 “ We say our prayer to God almighty , ” Mr. Adams said . “ That start our day , and that ’ s everything . ”

 Unchecked growth ha claimed Bobby ’ s Idle Hour , the last live-music venue on Nashville ’ s fabled Music Row .
 By Margaret Renkl
 Contributing Opinion Writer
 NASHVILLE — I am not a musician , or even an aspiring musician , but I moved to Nashville in 1987 because of music . One of my college roommate wa in graduate school at Vanderbilt and invited me to visit , and my own grad school boyfriend tagged along . Haywood wa , and still is , a picker himself , and he expected to fall in love with Music City ; he even packed his résumé .
 Katy Ginanni , my college friend , lived on 17th Avenue South , in the section called Music Square West . It ’ s part of a rectangle of street that collectively form Nashville ’ s fabled Music Row , which became the heart of Nashville ’ s music industry — not just country music , but also gospel music and Christian music and , in recent decade , pretty much every other kind of music . Music Row is the very definition of a cultural center , but Nashville ’ s cultural center didn ’ t spring from the mind of an urban planner . It grew up organically , a music-related business opened in the mid-20th century to capitalize on the growing popularity of country music .
 Centered on 16th and 17th Avenues , it wa originally the site of recording studio ( many of which have lately moved elsewhere ) , music-publishing firm , talent agency , publicist and booking office , all nestled among old bungalow and church and human-scale commercial building . B.B . King and Loretta Lynn and Dolly Parton and Elvis Presley and Charley Pride all recorded there , which you probably know , but so did Bob Dylan and Neil Young and Simon & Garfunkel and the Beach Boys , which you might not . In 2015 , the National Trust for Historic Preservation designated the whole district “ a national treasure . ”
 Tour bus drive up and down the street of Music Row , their guide telling tourist the story they came to town to hear . But the city ’ s explosive growth in the last decade ha imperiled it own beating heart , with quaint Music Row house and historic Music Row studio falling again and again to developer who put up fancy condominium and trendy restaurant and shiny office building in their place , despite concerted effort by individual and historic preservation nonprofit to save the Row ’ s character . In 2014 , we even nearly lost the iconic RCA Studio A .
 Back in 1987 , my friend Katy ’ s apartment wa within walking distance of the Country Music Hall of Fame ( it ha since moved downtown ) , a well a seemingly innumerable tiny “ museum ” dedicated to specific star . Broke a we were , Haywood and I paid to have our picture made with a wax museum version of Dolly Parton , just to have a souvenir of our visit . It wa so hot in the building that even Dolly ’ s wax doppelgänger is sweating in that Polaroid photo .
 We loved the kitsch , but what really sold u wa the music . We had arrived in Nashville in time for a music festival called Summer Lights , an act-after-act marvel of unfathomable talent . Near Katy ’ s place on Music Row , music and cigarette smoke poured out of the neighborhood bar , and during our visit we stopped in to tap our foot and drink a beer at I don ’ t know how many of them . We especially loved a shabby little tavern called Bobby ’ s Idle Hour .
 Back in those day Bobby ’ s occupied a trailer , which I remember thinking wa like a living stereotype , the kind of place that becomes the center of the story every time you talk about the time you went to Nashville . It ’ s nothing like the music-themed bar that now line the tourist center known a Lower Broad , where neon and big-hat country hold sway — the part of Nashville that the journalist Steve Cavendish , writing in Rolling Stone , call the “ bar industrial complex . ”
 Bobby ’ s is an altogether different kind of bar . It began life in 1948 simply a the Idle Hour . By 1978 , when Bobby Herald bought it and added his name to the sign , it had already been on the Row for decade , a place where songwriter and neighbor and music scout and industry regular gathered . On weekend afternoon , people would bring their kid to hear the music .
 In 2005 , the Idle Hour wa evicted from it longtime site — a condominium complex sits there now — and Bobby Herald and his wife , Dianne , moved the bar to it current location on 16th Avenue , eight door down from the old trailer . Bobby died later that year , but Dianne kept the bar going . It still ha autographed head shot of musician taped to the wall , interspersed with dollar bill signed by guest . Hundreds , maybe thousand , of dollar bill , many yellowed by smoke from the year before the bar banned smoking .
 Lizard Thom Case , 72 , bought the place in 2013 after Dianne retired , but he ’ d been a regular at the bar there for year before he bought it — so much of a regular that Dianne handpicked him to be Bobby ’ s “ steward , ” a Mr. Case call himself . Even he doesn ’ t remember how the tradition of taping dollar bill to the wall began : “ I don ’ t know how it started , but it grew like a fungus , ” he said . His best guess : “ Tourists love this place so much , they just want to leave some part of themselves here. ” Visitors still come back year later , he said , and take selfies next to their own signed bill .
 Last summer Mr. Case ’ s landlord announced that he wa selling the site and four adjacent building to a developer . ( All five evicted business are quintessentially Music City : a clothing store called So Nashville , a guitar repair shop , a music academy , a music publisher , and Bobby ’ s . ) Short of the kind of 11th-hour miracle that saved Studio A , Bobby ’ s Idle Hour ( “ The only live music venue on Music Row ! ” according to it website ) would end it seven-decade run , and yet another office building would rise in it place .
 “ Nashville doesn ’ t have preservation tool that other city use a a matter of course , ” Carolyn Brackett , senior field officer for the National Trust for Historic Preservation , told The Tennessean last summer . “ There are practical solution that would balance development with the preservation of Music Row ’ s historic fabric and retain the music business that fill them . We urge Mayor Briley and Metro Nashville leader to adopt them before it ’ s too late . ”
 For the current iteration of Bobby ’ s Idle Hour , it ’ s already too late . Last fall Bobby ’ s wa named to the “ Nashville 9 , ” an annual list of the most endangered historic place in Nashville , but this time no miracle wa forthcoming . Mr. Case ha until the end of the month to clear everything out .
 It wa never his plan to retire : “ If we ’ d been able to stay in this venue , this particular building , I could ’ ve kept this bar another 10 year , ” he said . “ I love it . I love nurturing the songwriter . I love setting up these great night of music . It ’ s been my life . ”
 I stopped by the bar on Jan. 12 , the last day it wa open to the public , and spoke with Josh Distad , 29 , a songwriter and Minnesota native who ’ s been tending bar at Bobby ’ s for the past four year . He and three other investor , all Bobby ’ s regular , had just bought the content of the bar , along with it name , from Lizard Case . They hope to open again at a new location in the summer . Mr. Distad isn ’ t worried about making Bobby ’ s a success ; Bobby ’ s is already a success , and he ’ s been studying what make it work . But he recognizes the force that he and his partner are up against , too .
 They ’ re considering a site just around the corner from the current Idle Hour , but there may be zoning issue to address there — it ’ s near a church — and other obstacle to repurposing the building a a tavern .
 The chief obstacle is Nashville itself . The five-year lease the building ’ s owner ha offered is within the new owner ’ price range , but they know they may well be priced out of the neighborhood again a soon a the lease is up , and they can ’ t afford to buy . “ The real estate in this area — real estate in the city , really — is so high now that a small mom-and-pop shop just can ’ t succeed , ” Mr. Distad said . “ The lowest property we found on the market in this area is listed for a million dollars. ” Even so , he belief the right place will turn up in time .
 The death of a neighborhood bar in a growing city is in no way a tragedy . There are much more disruptive consequence to poorly planned growth : the loss of affordable work-force housing , the destruction of a vibrant tree canopy that offset the effect of greenhouse gas , destabilized community and debilitating strain on aging infrastructure , among others . But cultural continuity doe matter . Bobby ’ s Idle Hour is “ part of the fabric of this town , ” said Carolyn Lethgo , 29 , a Middle Tennessee native and one of Mr. Distad ’ s co-investors . “ We just want to carry on the meaning and the legacy of this place . ”
 It ’ s quite a legacy . Before you even walk in the door , the big plywood guitar out front tell you that Bobby ’ s Idle Hour is the place you ’ ve been looking for , the kind of place that make you pack up and move to a new city to start your life all over again . In part because of Bobby ’ s , my husband and I have been here 31 year , our entire adult life .
 Jonathan Long , 72 , is a songwriter from upstate New York who came here in 1971 . He ’ s also one of the Idle Hour ’ s longtime bartender : “ I ’ ve been working here 20 year , ” he told me , “ but I ’ ve been drinking here 47. ” He plan to be at work at the new Idle Hour , too , wherever it land , even if that ’ s not on Music Row .
 I asked Mr. Long if the Nashville moment had passed , if it ’ s too late now for a songwriter with a dream to make a life in Nashville . He wasn ’ t entirely hopeless : “ If it ’ s something you want to do , don ’ t even bother to come here , ” he said . “ If it ’ s something you have to do , you might want to come . But if it ’ s something you are , get your as down here . It ha to be who you are , or it ’ s not going to work . ”

 This ancient town on the Vietnamese coast ha charm , history and beauty to spare . It is also budget-friendly , and for foodie , a delight .
 By Patrick Scott
 Situated on the coast of central Vietnam , the former commercial port of Hoi An offer endless wonder , from fisherman launching bamboo basket boat along palm-fringed beach , to farmer in conical hat harvesting rice in swathe of green paddy . But the marquee attraction is the well-preserved ancient town , brushed mustard yellow and festooned with colorful silk lantern . Many of the wooden merchant house and ornate temple and assembly hall — a fusion of style from China , Europe and Japan — date back to Hoi An ’ s prime in the 1700s . By the early 1800s , though , the river port wa supplanted by Danang to the north , and largely forgotten . Unesco World Heritage site status in 1999 boosted a revival , and in recent year mass tourism ha landed hard , with multitude of tour bus and resort . Still , Hoi An hold plenty of charm , with budget-friendly price and a vibrant gastronomic scene .
 Many of the narrow , two-story shophouses have been repurposed with restaurant , cafe and a glut of tailor and leather shop . But several have been frozen in time and opened to tourist , like the two-century-old Tan Ky house . Start your old town tour here ( 120,000 dong , or about $ 5.15 , for entry to five of the more than 20 historic site ) , and roam it 100-foot length , past intricately carved column and beam , through the open-roof courtyard , to a wall in the back , marked with the height of fall flood . Next up is Phuc Kien , one of five assembly hall built by Chinese merchant to plot trade deal and honor ancestor . Its sea goddess temple hold an unforgettable life-size statue of an aquamarine-skinned immortal with protruding rib and bulging white eye . End up at the Japanese covered bridge , an arched pagoda built in 1593 and later reconstructed by the Chinese and Vietnamese . Its roof is adorned with the town ’ s ubiquitous alternating row of yin yang tile .
 2 ) 3 p.m . Silk row
 Spinning and selling silk to foreign trader wa a thriving business in Hoi An century ago . Now the transaction occur inside more than 600 tailor shop . The quality and fit can be hit or miss . ( Bring a favorite garment to be copied and allow time for alteration ; turnaround is within 24 hour . My wife wa thrilled with silk pant , 940,000 dong each , from Le Le Cloth Shop . ) If you ’ re more interested in the silk-making process , stop by Thang Loi for a tour and watch how silkworm munch on mulberry leaf and create cocoon that yield nearly 1,000 yard of thread , woven on a clacking loom .
 Since he first traveled to Vietnam 27 year ago , Didier Corlou ha been on a mission to promote it cuisine through his cookbook and restaurant in Hanoi . Now the renowned French chef is serving up his passion in Hoi An at Co Mai . Opened last year with his co-chef wife , Hoang Phuong Mai , the restaurant fittingly occupies a former spice house . The tasting menu ( 395,000 dong ) is your best bet for a bounty of “ Hoi An on the plate , ” a Mr. Corlou put it . Recently , the fresh and flavorful main of braised pork , Saigon Marseille curry and barracuda in banana leaf followed starter like banana flower salad with chicken , and fried roll with mackerel and pork and mushroom . Save room for the dessert tray that includes mango sorbet and banana cake with caramelized cream .
 The town start to shut down around 9 p.m. , but a few bar stay open late . Watch boat owner coax tourist onto the river from the curbside table at Shamrock Irish Pub , which feature a craft stout from Saigon ’ s Heart of Darkness brewery , or shoot pool to classic rock at the Dive Bar on Nguyen Thai Hoc street . The closest thing to a speakeasy is Tadioto , a new whisky bar in the French Quarter . It ’ s hidden behind An Store clothing boutique , which lead to Tadioto ’ s sushi counter in the stone courtyard and then to the elegant bar in the back . Sip Tadioto ’ s namesake scotch ( 180,000 dong ) or Suntory ’ s Hibiki ( 250,000 dong ) . Open till midnight . ( Nguyen Qui Duc , the owner , is set to open a Japanese grill and beer garden next door in the spring . )
 Most hotel and home-stays include bike , so cycle out to the rice paddy between the town and the beach and marvel at acre of green patched with shrimp and fish pond . Ride along sandy path under canopy of coconut tree , past lolling water buffalo and farmer ushering flock of duck into narrow canal . Pull into the Tra Que Vegetable Village , organic garden where you can take an 8 a.m. tour and learn how to till the sandy soil and plant red leaf lettuce before sampling just-picked green at breakfast in the shade of the outdoor cooking school and cafe . The waiter will show you how to assemble a roll of rice-flour-and-egg pancake with mint , lemon basil and lettuce . Tour and breakfast 280,000 dong .
 A starter kit for escaping into the world .
 Coffee in Vietnam is a sit-down affair , often on a sidewalk at child-size plastic chair and table . For a delightful twist on the traditional condensed milk iced coffee , take a seat riverside at Cong Caphe , with it Communist army décor , for a coconut-milk-and-cream coffee smoothie ( 45,000 dong ) . For a more refined coffee break with larger chair , try Mia Coffee amid a low-slung row of French colonial on Phan Boi Chau street . Le Quang Huy , the owner , source bean from the mountain of Dalat , roast them on site and compress cappuccino ( 37,000 dong ) and traditional Vietnamese brew ( 30,000 dong ) with a machine from Seattle .
 Hoi An is known for several local dish like white rose dumpling and chicken rice . Most emblematic of it multicultural past is Cao Lau — with the flavor of Japan in the thick rice noodle , China in the soy pork and France in the rice flour crouton . Try it at Hoi An Market . Barnlike , it stretch from the river , where a riot of table loaded with papaya and dragon fruit lead to the raw meat counter inside , then to stall loaded with incense and spice , and woman napping on bench ( it open at 6 a.m. ) The main hall is filled with about 60 brightly lit glass hutch stocked with spring roll and plate of orange shrimp . Perch at the metal counter at No . 50 and plop fresh green into a bowl of cao lau spiced with red chili paste . Lunch for two 150,000 dong .
 Take a truncated tour of Vietnam ’ s ethnic community at the Precious Heritage Museum , opened in 2017 by the French photographer Réhahn . He spent eight year traveling to 53 of the country ’ s 54 ethnic group , photographing villager and collecting costume , including a tree bark jacket on display upstairs . The free museum in the French Quarter is also a gallery of Réhahn ’ s portrait , on sale a postcard for 30,000 dong , up to large , metallic paper print for ten of thousand of dollar . If he ’ s there , he ’ ll share the backstory of his most famous shot , “ Hidden Smile , ” a close-up of a puckish woman in a conical hat covering her forehead and mouth with her hand . The portrait wa presented to President Emmanuel Macron of France by Communist official last year . On most morning the subject , 80-year-old Bui Thi Xong , is on the river in Hoi An ( near Cargo restaurant ) offering ride in her row boat .
 Even if you didn ’ t mean to , you may find yourself in one of Trinh Diem Vy ’ s eight restaurant in and around the old city . Definitely make it to Vy ’ s Market . Its food-court-meets-street-cart setup ha 200-plus traditional dish , from steamed pig brain to monk fish curry . Try the beef rolled in betel leaf ( 105,000 dong ) and the pumpkin curry served in the gourd ( 85,000 dong ) . As tasty a those are , do not miss the squid stuffed with pork ( 175,000 dong ) . The meat is minced with mushroom and spring onion and peppered with spice , and the pan is caramelized by the fried squid skin .
 After dinner , step into the side street and Hoi An ’ s main night market . Zigzag through the banana pancake cart and shuffling tour group , to a row of stall alight with silk lantern . Make your way across the footbridge ( mind the bikers pedaling through the throng ) to a small square with elevated bamboo hut where local gather for a sort of singing bingo . On certain night , you ’ ll find family curbside at metal drum burning fake money and other offering for ancestor . Every night , you ’ ll find tout offering river ride . For 120,000 dong for 15 minute , step into a little wooden boat , join the flotilla and watch an oil painting come to life , the profusion of lantern on the boat and river bank reflecting on the dark , crinkled water .
 Within a half-hour drive of the ancient town , you can ride a basket boat through river channel thick with water coconut tree or climb the step of the Marble Mountain into cave with towering Buddhas . This being a beach town , why not just relax at Tan Thanh Beach ? Not a busy a An Bang Beach to the north , this stretch of sea and sand is mesmerizing with a moderate surf , and view of the Cham Islands on the horizon . You can ’ t go wrong with a coffee or a smoothie at Salt Pub or Sound of Silence , where you can use the lounge and thatched gazebo and on a clear day see the skyscraper of Danang in miniature up the coast .
 Some of the best discovery are along the narrow walkway off the ancient town . That ’ s where you ’ ll find Nu Eatery , just west of the Japanese bridge , in a distressed looking former house with three small room and a balcony for dining .

 Critic ’ s Notebook
 A vibrant visual art community offer museum and alternative space in which to commune and ponder how to move forward .
 By Martha Schwendener
 For the art world , the biggest news coming out of Pittsburgh last year should have been the opening of the 57th edition of the Carnegie International , the oldest survey exhibition of visual art in the United States . Instead , news of that exhibition wa eclipsed in October by a shooting at the progressive Tree of Life Synagogue in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh , which killed 11 people and wounded six .
 Art seems minor in the wake of such event . And yet , a time and history stretch out in the aftermath of trauma , art becomes a prime place where tragedy is acknowledged , memorialized and processed .
 Art is an inherently hopeful gesture , and a institution increasingly become forum ( “ laboratory , ” in the current parlance ) for new idea — not just place to show off wealth or wield “ soft power ” — they can be place to heal and ponder how to move forward . In Pittsburgh — where vast sum of money made relatively quickly during the Industrial Revolution were spent on art — museum and alternative space abound , complementing many school and university . Contemporary art , with it global ambition , feel right at home . The city wa , historically , a magnet for immigrant and home to indigenous people . A recent tour of Pittsburgh showed how the vibrant visual art community , in many way , offer a model for diversity and tolerance .
 Through March 25 at Carnegie Museum of Art ; 412-622-3131 , cmoa.org .
 This edition of the Carnegie International , organized by Ingrid Schaffner , includes 32 artist and artist collective — and very few unfamiliar name . The upside of this approach is that many of the artist here are midcareer and know , from experience , how to operate within the potentially homogenizing context of a large exhibition and create exceptional display . Several here are outstanding , activating the Carnegie Museum of Art ’ s collection and making you think differently about art history .
 On the outside of the museum , El Anatsui , the Ghanaian sculptor who ha become one of the most imitated artist in Africa , ha draped the upper facade of the entrance with a work made from his signature found bottle cap and printing plate sourced from a Pittsburgh printing press . The work treat the museum like a kind of body to be dressed with a garment . Inside the gallery , Ulrike Müller and Sarah Crowner use bright tile , enamel , weaving and canvas sewn together to test the line between art and craft . Nearby , a terrific presentation of portrait by Lynette Yiadom-Boakye with cryptic title suggests painting a a portal into the everyday life of her character , while Dayanita Singh ’ s installation with lush silver gelatin image bundled in cloth in India question how history in the form of image is archived and stored .
 The boundary between furniture and sculpture is playfully transgressed in Jessi Reaves ’ s fantastic full-room installation , where art and design blend . You ’ re encouraged to sit on the sculpture-furniture . If you make the pilgrimage out to Fallingwater , Frank Lloyd Wright ’ s “ cabin ” masterpiece designed for the family of Edgar J. Kaufmann , you can see Ms. Reaves ’ s sculpture on the terrace , made during a residency there : a lanky homemade shelving unit with an iridescent burgundy zip-on mantle that look like a sadomasochistic vampire ’ s cape .
 Back in the museum , Josiah McElheny , working with the curator John Corbett and Jim Dempsey , show his MacArthur-award mettle with an expertly researched display . Curious musical instrument and document relate to maverick composer like Harry Partch , Pauline Oliveros and Lucia Dlugoszewski , who created sculptural wooden instrument that are one of the standouts of the installation .
 Two artist who engage with the Carnegie ’ s collection in innovative way are Karen Kilimnik and Jeremy Deller . Mr. Deller ha installed tiny video screen in window-size case in the museum , turning historical display of upscale living room into updated everypersons ’ dollhouse . Ms. Kilimnik is exhibiting her effusively florid painting alongside the Carnegie ’ s decorative art collection , a if to show how the salon-style hang , created to bring art ( and intellectual discourse ) to mass audience in the French salon of the 18th and 19th century , could also be a form of aspirational kitsch .
 One of the most ambitious presentation here is the terrific show-within-a-show , “ Dig Where You Stand , ” organized by the Cameroon-born Koyo Kouoh , with research contributed by graduate student at the University of Pittsburgh . Drawing from the collection of the Carnegie Museums for what she call a “ visual essay , ” she point out that changing language is the taproot of changing idea . She want u to rethink “ coloniality ” — different form of colonialism and occupation — since Africa , she point out in the guide , is a continent with 54 very different country ; the one thing they all share is that they were colonized .
 Throughout the ocher-colored space she ha paired object and image to make you question their origin and message . African sculpture sit near Mickalene Thomas ’ s photograph of black woman assuming the pose from a famous Manet painting . Screenprints by Kara Walker are juxtaposed with a cutout silhouette of an “ honorable ” gentleman holding a whip .
 Ms. Kouoh throw all category into a quandary . Bernd and Hilla Becher ’ s black-and-white photograph of outdated industrial structure in Germany — considered landmark of conceptual art — are shown next to Teenie Harris ’ s photograph of a 1950s home-appliance fair for African-Americans in Pittsburgh . What defines art history and constitutes a survey museum ? What ’ s included , championed and omitted — and how do those decision reflect colonial and racist history ? The implication is that every encyclopedic museum is probably sitting on a trove of exceptional object that could be artfully rearranged to promote diversity , inclusion and tolerance , rather than acquisition and power . ( Unless , of course , all the art should be “ repatriated ” and sent back to where it wa made , though “ home ” may no longer exist . )
 Through Aug. 4 at the Mattress Factory ; 412-231-3169 , mattress.org .
 The Mattress Factory , Pittsburgh ’ s premier alternative space , housed in a former industrial building and a couple of annex , ha become a mecca for installation art . Here you will find immersive work by the pioneering light artist James Turrell and one of Yayoi Kusama ’ s wildly popular “ infinity rooms. ” The focus , however , is on the temporary resident at the Mattress Factory and what they produce . The project by 2018 resident include the Brazilian collective OSGEMEOS ’ s top-floor installation , with large yellow light bulb sprouting from the floor , altered photograph and painting that pay homage to cheap portrait studio in Latin America , and a wild zoetrope , a pre-film animation device that wind up a couple of time a day .
 Laleh Mehran ’ s darkened room in the basement relies on viewer-activated digital effect that update the ancient Persian concept of “ Boroosh ” or “ glimmer of light. ” In the nearby Monterey Annex , Karina Smigla-Bobinski ’ s transparent ball , studded with charcoal and inspired by nanobiotechnology and 19th-century computer prototype , becomes a viewer-activated drawing machine you can bounce off the wall . Christina A. West ’ s electric apple-hued “ Screen ” ( 2018 ) is like a distorted fun house inspired by photographic green screen . In general , the work at the Mattress Factory are engaging crowd pleaser that challenge how we create and relate to our environment — although sometimes they sacrifice rigor for social-media “ like . ”
 Through Feb. 3 at Miller ICA at Carnegie Mellon University ; 412-268-3618 , miller-ica.cmu.edu .
 Located on a university campus and close to research laboratory devoted to information technology , “ Paradox : The Body in the Age of AI , ” a show of 11 contemporary artist organized by Elizabeth Chodos at Miller ICA , offer a perfect context for considering human of the future . The title refers to Moravec ’ s paradox , the discovery that we can teach machine to reason and play chess — but not to master toddler-level sensorimotor skill encoded in the human brain through evolution . Claudia Hart ’ s installation with a virtual reality headset activates this principle by putting you in a new , disorienting sensorial environment . Jes Fan and Nick Cave create biomorphic sculpture that imagine new life-forms , and Zach Blas ’ s speculative video envisions a post-gender , post-capitalist cyberworld .
 Questioning the role of the artist in the age of artificial intelligence , Brian Bress includes his own work-in-progress a one of the illusionistic layer in a video laden with visual trickery , called “ Sunset Geometry ” ( 2018 ) . Siebren Versteeg ’ s algorithmically generated painting machine make attractive abstraction , suggesting that AI is slowly closing the gap between rational computing and corporeal creativity .
 Through March 17 at the Andy Warhol Museum ; 412-237-8300 , warhol.org .
 In the mid-1970s , Andy Warhol wa commissioned by an Italian art dealer to create portrait of drag star who treated gender — altered through clothing , wig and makeup — a a medium . “ Ladies and Gentlemen ” ( 1974-75 ) is paradoxically one of Warhol ’ s largest and yet least-known series . A collaged painting made with glitter , rhinestone and jewelry by Devan Shimoyama , an art professor at Carnegie Mellon University , hang alongside the “ Ladies and Gentlemen ” painting , creating a near-perfect pairing .
 On another floor in the Warhol Museum , Mr. Shimoyama present dozen of painting , sculpture and photograph in which he us himself a a boundary-testing and stereotype-breaking model , often in the imagined context of the African-American barbershop , a hotbed of heteronormative masculinity . A series of photograph created by Mr. Shimoyama during a residency on Fire Island in New York , in 2015 , document private ritual he performed on the beach with driftwood . He made the photograph at a moment when violence against black Americans wa , once again , headline news , and began by reading about witchcraft , queer counterculture and chaos magic , photographing his body like a shaman , in the same way Warhol ’ s subject performed in various gender to rise above a bleak real world .
 Through Jan. 6 at the Frick Pittsburgh ; 412-371-0600 , thefrickpittsburgh.org .
 The Belgian artist Isabelle de Borchgrave us paper to remake historical costume and dress in famous museum painting . Inspired by a visit to the Metropolitan Museum of Art ’ s Costume Institute in the mid-1990s , Ms. de Borchgrave ’ s crumpled , pleated and painted marvel sit perfectly within the Frick ’ s collection of old master , imitating the silk , satin , velvet and brocade the artist captured in paint . There are re-creation here of costume worn by queen and mythical goddess in masterpiece by Botticelli and other painter , and of fashion design by Paul Poiret and Jeanne Lanvin . Some of her most stunning work here , however , hang on wall : They recreate Central Asia caftan from the 1700s to the 1800s , which Ms. de Borchgrave first encountered in Istanbul . They demonstrate her considerable skill a a painter and expand the Frick ’ s Western European-inspired collection into the custom and aesthetic of culture far beyond the aspiration of Pittsburgh ’ s Gilded Age patron .

 As the spiritual and production home of HBO ’ s sprawling fantasy drama , Northern Ireland ha been transformed by the show . We take you there .
 By Jeremy Egner
 CUSHENDUN , Northern Ireland — The many marvel dotting the dramatic Antrim Coast of Northern Ireland include a cluster of eerily beautiful cave in this tidy village , around 45 mile north of Belfast . Formed by 400 million year of shifting red stone and the surging slate-blue Irish Sea , the cave inspire awed reflection upon the raw power of nature and the irresistible imprint of time , among other musing on the mystic .
 A voice whispered into my ear : “ That ’ s where Melisandre gave birth to the shadow monster . ”
 So it wa — I knew it wa around there somewhere , a did the dozen of “ Game of Thrones ” fan surrounding me , feverishly snapping selfies before returning to their tour bus in a nearby parking lot .
 The voice belonged to my own guide , Flip Robinson , a 6-foot-8 , magnificently bearded man who previously parlayed his stature into a gig a a stand-in for behemoth character like Hodor and the Mountain . He waved to a colleague a she led her group away a suddenly a it had arrived , and off toward Braavos or the Iron Islands or some other “ Thrones ” location down the road .
 Since debuting a an expensive curiosity in 2011 , “ Game of Thrones ” ha gone on to become one of the world ’ s most influential pop culture franchise , leaving a dragon-size footprint on everything it touch .
 Nowhere is that dynamic more visible and tangible than the production ’ s former home , which , a the series kick off it final season on HBO on April 14 , is poised to serve a the keeper of the “ Thrones ” flame .
 “ Game of Thrones ” ha filmed all over the globe , including in Croatia , Spain , Morocco , Iceland and Malta , and other location have become synonymous with the show , for better and worse . But a the home of not only the production , in Belfast ’ s Titanic Studios , but also Westeros itself , Northern Ireland ha been transformed in fact and figment . As the series altered the TV landscape , it also altered actual landscape : For million of viewer all over the world , this country ha been redefined and remade in the show ’ s image .
 In the process , Belfast ’ s filmmaking industry ha gone from a sleepy endeavor to a powerhouse . “ ‘ Game of Thrones ’ changed everything , ” said Richard Williams , the chief executive of Northern Ireland Screen , which promotes film and television production in the country . “ We are relevant — it is basically night and day . ”
 The region ha also built a tourism economy on the back of the show , especially on the coast , which provided much of the outdoor scenery . This majestic stretch of landscape and it famously scenic Causeway Coastal Route is now crisscrossed with motor coach bearing “ Thrones ” pilgrim . Elsewhere , spot like the Castle Ward estate , near Strangford , site of the original Winterfell , have seen crowd swell with thousand of fan each year .
 All told , “ Thrones ” ha funneled hundred of million of dollar into the region . But the financial benefit might actually pale compared with a more existential one in a place that for decade wa known internationally mostly for sectarian violence .
 “ Twenty year ago , you would have been here writing about the Troubles , not a TV show , ” Gary Hawthorne , one of my driver , told me during my visit .
 Robinson said , “ Fake violence ha helped bring u back from the real violence . ”
 Part of the outsize impact “ Thrones ” ha had on Northern Ireland come from the size of the production relative to the size of the place , which wa a main reason it wa such an ideal home base . At 5,460 square mile , the country is a bit larger than Connecticut ( with just over half a many resident , at around 1.9 million ) . But within that area is an astounding array of scenery that is particularly suited to a medieval fantasy saga .
 “ We had 63 location in 10 year , every single one of them within and hour and a half of Belfast , ” said Robert Boake , the supervising location manager in Northern Ireland .
 This became apparent on the afternoon I spent driving with Robinson along the causeway , a twisting roadway that hug the U-shaped glen of the coast , the Irish Sea on one side and village and vertiginous green hillside , strewn with sheep , on the other .
 In mere hour , we spanned Westeros and beyond , moving from the Wall and Castle Black ( Magheramorne quarry ) , to the stair where Arya crawled out of the Braavos canal ( Carnlough Harbor ) to the rocky shoreline in Pyke ( Ballintoy ) where the Greyjoys did nutty Greyjoy stuff . We also closed the shadow-baby loop , strolling around the Stormlands meadow ( near Murlough Bay ) where Renly made camp until Melisandre ’ s monster got ahold of him . Occasionally we stopped to walk around and by turn get lashed with rain , pummeled by wind and caressed by crystalline sunshine . ( “ In Northern Ireland , you get four season in one day , ” Robinson told me , which I eventually came to realize is a national slogan . )
 At Fair Head outside Ballycastle , we parked in a muddy lot , dropped a few pound in the honor box and walked uphill through a horizontal downpour . About 20 minute later , the rain wa gone and the sun dried our face a gale-force gust threatened to blow u over the edge of a sheer cliff dropping hundred of foot to the rocky coast .
 We ’ d arrived at Dragonstone , or the dazzling headland the Targaryen family stronghold wa C.G.I. ’ d upon , anyway . To stand where the impossibly green meadow give way to gray granite cliff plummeting toward the sea , a you note the spot where Tyrion and Daenerys argued over strategy , where Jon Snow met Drogon , is to feel the frisson of an epic story meeting an epic landscape .
 This reciprocity between project and place extends beyond the countryside . Another reason the marriage between “ Thrones ” and the region ha been happier than any on the show is that the production ’ s material need — armor , medieval weapon , elaborate costume and jewelry — meshed well with the area ’ s longstanding artisanal tradition . “ We ’ re good at that stuff , ” Williams said .
 Even when a fight wa filmed in a place like Morocco , the spear were almost always built in Belfast . Fans who would like to try on a replica of Cersei ’ s crown can often do so at Steensons jeweler in Ballymena , because that ’ s where the original and other Westerosi finery were designed and made . ( Though when I stopped in , I wa told that the show had commandeered it for Season 8 — spoiler alert , I guess ? )
 This may be one explanation for the general lack of resentment evident in other location besieged by “ Thrones ” tourist , like Dubrovnik , the exterior home of King ’ s Landing , which ha been almost totally overrun .
 “ There are not many people in this country who haven ’ t been involved in some direct capacity , ” Boake said . “ Their brother made something for the show , or their sister wa an extra , or their cousin worked on an episode . ”
 As we drove along the coast , Robinson reminisced about his time a Hodor ’ s double , dodging White Walker stuntmen in the Three-Eyed Raven ’ s cave a he dragged Bran ’ s double toward a green screen , in one of the show ’ s most famous scene . “ Then Kristian Nairn held the door , ” he said . “ He did the easy bit . ”
 Robinson , 52 , wa a former carpenter laid low by the global financial crisis , working a a tour guide when he applied to be a “ Thrones ” extra . Soon he wa facing off with the like of Lena Headey and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau a a stand-in for the undead Mountain , a stint that became the hook for his Giant Tours , which take small group of “ Thrones ” fan up and down the coast .
 “ It changed my life around , ” he said .
 The show ha done the same for the region ’ s movie industry . A few film had been shot in Belfast ’ s cavernous old ship painting hall , now part of Titanic Studios ( so named because it ’ s near where the doomed ocean liner , the city ’ s other most famous export , wa built ) . But since “ Thrones ” took up residence there , it ha turbocharged the business , conferring the credibility that come from hosting the most elaborate TV series in history and training a generation of crew and craftspeople .
 Belfast ha since added another enormous studio complex , Belfast Harbour Studios , the current home of Syfy ’ s Superman prequel series “ Krypton , ” and postproduction house like Yellowmoon , which worked on “ Thrones , ” have significantly expanded .
 Then there ’ s the measurable financial impact : Over eight season , “ Game of Thrones ” ha spent more than $ 275 million in the region , according to Northern Ireland Screen .
 Of course , two big question hang over all the success . One involves how Brexit might affect the industry , though Williams note that for the large-scale production that are Belfast ’ s bread and butter , significantly more production spending come from the United States than the European Union.The other : What happens now that “ Thrones ” is over ? While everyone is cautiously optimistic that the planned “ Thrones ” prequel will go forward a a series , especially given the interest HBO ’ s new owner , AT & T , will have in extending such a lucrative franchise , they aren ’ t reliant upon it . “ We ’ re getting call every week , ” Williams said .
 “ I ’ m not in the slightest gloomy about our potential after ‘ Game of Thrones , ’ ” he added . “ But at the same time , I would never want to diminish how unique a thing ‘ Game of Thrones ’ is . ”
 The most common analogy hold that “ Thrones ” is to Northern Ireland what the “ Lord of the Rings ” movie were to New Zealand — a pop culture phenomenon that showcased a wondrous land for a global audience . But one difference is that “ Thrones ” ha helped to redefine a city once known a one of the most dangerous place on earth .
 From the late 1960s to the late 1990s , the Troubles , which pit Protestant paramilitary group loyal to the Crown against Catholic one in favor of a unified , independent Ireland , claimed some 3,600 life in bombing , sniper attack and bloody street battle that ripped Belfast apart .
 Old division remain and have been infused with new anxiety by Brexit , because it unclear how it will affect the open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland . But the show ha helped “ continue our peace process , ” said Conleth Hill , better known to “ Thrones ” fan a the cunning Varys . As one of the few actor from Northern Ireland in the cast — he grew up and still life in Ballycastle — Hill ha observed the show ’ s impact from both inside and out .
 “ Before the Troubles , there wa load of tourist coming through my town , ” he said . “ Now they ’ re coming again . ”
 The swarm figure to increase when HBO turn several former “ Thrones ” set across the region into immersive tourist attraction featuring costume , weapon and other artifact from the show . The first , the Game of Thrones Studio Tour at Linen Mill Studios in Banbridge , is slated to open in the spring of 2020 .
 Tourism NI ha aggressively courted Westeros set-jetters , creating a location app and outfitting filming site with information plaque for self-guided pilgrim , while keeping the many different “ Thrones ” tour from running afoul of HBO ’ s copyright lawyer . The show generates roughly $ 60 million per year in tourism income , said John McGrillen , the agency ’ s chief executive .
 The agency also promotes the link between the show and the region ’ s artisanal heritage with project like the enormous “ Game of Thrones ” Tapestry , based on the Bayeux Tapestry in France ; it us Belfast ’ s world-famous linen-weaving expertise to depict the “ Thrones ” story .
 I saw it at the Ulster Museum , a few floor above an exhibition about the Troubles . The 217-foot-long tapestry recap the entire tale , from King Robert ’ s arrival at Winterfell in the pilot to the zombie dragon Viserion demolishing the Wall in the Season 7 finale . ( The artist will extend it to add the rest of the story after “ Thrones ” end . ) Much like the show itself , the tapestry is fundamentally bonkers but astounding in scale and execution , and a tremendous kick to experience .
 A still more immersive wallow in “ Thrones ” dom awaited me at Castle Ward , about an hour south of the city . The guide William Van der Kells greeted me in full Northern regalia : a black cloak and faux fur collar with a shiny gauntlet on one hand , holding a large sword made of “ the finest Valyrian rubber. ” A longtime National Trust site , Castle Ward added a “ Winterfell tour ” after the show shot much of the first season on the property , and promptly brought in more than 25,000 additional visitor a year .
 The Stark castle wa based around the 1610 tower house , the same one Bran climbed to discover Jaime and Cersei in flagrante twincestus . We shot arrow on the spot in the courtyard the Stark child did in one of the first scene of the series , a few yard from where Tyrion smacked Joffrey in one of the show ’ s most GIF-able moment . Then we drove through a driving rain to other location on the property , like the tree where Robb Stark and Talisa fatefully tied the knot , before taking cover beneath an old castle near the site of Walder Frey ’ s ( digitally projected ) one , where it all ended badly . “ Around here you get all four season in a day , ” Van der Kells said .
 By then , I wa wearing the cloak and snapping my own selfies to send to my daughter . The only shadow monster in evidence wa the storm cloud dumping rain on me . But a I peered through the gloom and fog at the choppy Strangford Lough , it occurred to me that while I ’ d come to see how “ Game of Thrones ” had redefined Northern Ireland , what struck me most wa how Northern Ireland had defined it .

There ’ s plenty of fun to be had in watching Marty McFly ( Michael J .

 After Tim Burton and Christopher Nolan moved the Caped Crusader in an increasingly dark direction — to say nothing of the outright drudgery of Ben Affleck in “ Batman v Superman : Dawn of Justice ” — the Batman character really needed to lighten up a bit . “ The Lego Batman Movie ” doe the great service of taking him down a peg , with a gravel-voiced Will Arnett playing a vain , egomaniacal jerk who doesn ’ t work well with others and want to take all the credit for himself . As with all the Lego movie , this one is chockablock with pop culture reference and playroom action sequence , but it carry a well-realized theme about the value of friendship and teamwork , and how real hero don ’ t have to go it alone .

Rejecting all commercial consideration , Rogers held theme week on divorce , poverty and death , and offered gentle guidance for his most vulnerable viewer .
 ‘ The 40-Year-Old Virgin ’ Starts streaming : Feb. 6
 It didn ’ t seem revolutionary at the time , but when Judd Apatow ’ s “ The 40-Year-Old Virgin ” slipped into theater in 2005 , it changed the landscape of studio comedy , introducing a gallery of rising star and a producer/director whose imprimatur would dominate film and television , and putting a new premium on improv-heavy ensemble and huge comic set piece . As a film , it ’ s still a sweet and hilarious upending of the ‘ 80s-style teen sex comedy , casting Steve Carell a a middle-age bachelor who ha yet to be deflowered . Apatow and company would run the theme of arrested adolescence into the ground in the year to come , but the earnestness underpinning Carell ’ s relationship to his buddy ( Paul Rudd , Seth Rogen and Romany Malco ) and his more experienced girlfriend ( Catherine Keener ) counteracts the juvenilia .

 Another from the Sundance-to-Netflix pipeline , “ Paddleton ” reunites co-writer and star Mark Duplass and the director Alex Lehmann , who worked together on the stellar coming-home drama “ Blue Jay. ” Though it address the issue of assisted suicide , “ Paddleton ” is another low-key Duplass production that ’ s more about relationship than politics , focusing on the bond between a terminally ill layabout ( Duplass ) and his neighbor ( Ray Romano ) in a crummy apartment building . The two have to travel a great distance to get the necessary drug , which give the film the shambling quality of a road movie , albeit one that pause frequently to indulge the lifestyle of two middle-age slacker .
 ‘ Russian Doll ’ Starts streaming : Feb. 1
 From “ Slums of Beverly Hills ” to “ Orange Is the New Black , ” Natasha Lyonne ha specialized in playing hot mess , beating back misfortune with acerbic wit and self-deprecation . Lyonne ’ s highly anticipated new series “ Russian Doll , ” which she created with Amy Poehler and Leslye Headland , take those quality to dark new extreme , casting her a a panicked young woman stuck in a grisly “ Groundhog Day ” scenario . Every night she go to the same New York City party , and every night she dy in some horrific fashion . What lesson is the universe trying to teach her ? Presumably the show will have the answer .
 ‘ One Day at a Time ’ : Season 3Starts streaming : Feb. 8

Its Netflix revival , built around a Cuban-American family in Los Angeles , ha successfully carried the same spirit into the issue of the day .

 André Previn , who blurred the boundary between jazz , pop and classical music — and between composing , conducting and performing — in an extraordinarily eclectic , award-filled career , died on Thursday at his home in Manhattan . He wa 89 .
 His death wa confirmed by his manager , Linda Petrikova .
 Mr. Previn wrote or arranged the music for dozen of movie and received four Academy Awards , and wa nominated for three Oscars in one year alone — 1961 , for the score for “ Elmer Gantry ” and “ Bells Are Ringing ” and the song “ Faraway Part of Town ” from the comedy “ Pepe . ”
 Audiences knew him a well a a jazz pianist who appeared with Ella Fitzgerald , among others , and a a composer who turned out musical , orchestral work , chamber music , opera and concerto , including several for his fifth wife , the violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter . He wa also the music director or principal conductor of a half-dozen orchestra .
 [ Listen to the full range of Mr. Previn ’ s multifaceted career . ]
 Critics described Mr. Previn a a “ wunderkind in a turtleneck ” and the “ Mickey Mouse maestro ” when he wa in his 20 and 30 . He wa often compared to Leonard Bernstein , a similarly versatile conductor , composer and pianist . Time magazine ’ s headline when Mr. Previn became the principal conductor of the London Symphony in 1968 wa “ Almost Like Bernstein. ” Newsweek summarized his appointment a music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic in 1985 a “ Bernstein West . ”
 And like Bernstein , Mr. Previn wa no stranger to a life of glamour and medium attention , particularly when the actress Mia Farrow left Frank Sinatra , her husband , and married Mr. Previn after an affair that had become grist for the gossip column .
 “ See you in the Morning beloved Friend , ” Ms. Farrow , who wa divorced from Mr. Previn in 1979 , tweeted on Thursday . “ May you rest in glorious symphony . ”
 Mr. Previn himself considered Bernstein an idol . “ Bernstein ha made it possible not to specialize in one area of music , ” he said . “ You no longer have to do just Broadway show , or movie , or conduct — you can do any or all of them . ”
 And Mr. Previn did . In the 1960s , he appeared in sold-out classical and jazz concert . Sometimes he combined genre , playing a concerto before intermission and jazz with a trio after . Dizzy Gillespie marveled at his performance . “ He ha the flow , you know , which a lot of guy don ’ t have and won ’ t ever get , ” he said .
 Mr. Previn made recording with Benny Carter and Mahalia Jackson and an album of jazz arrangement of song from “ My Fair Lady ” with the drummer Shelly Manne and the bass player Leroy Vinnegar . ( Mr. Previn wa later the conductor and music supervisor for the film version of “ My Fair Lady. ” ) He also made two album with Dinah Shore and recorded a collection of Christmas carol with Julie Andrews and George Gershwin ’ s “ Rhapsody in Blue ” with Andre Kostelanetz .
 But the classical world wa never comfortable with his work in jazz , and the jazz historian Ted Gioia said Mr. Previn had been “ something of a popularizer of jazz rather than a serious practitioner . ”
 Mr. Previn disdained all the label . “ I never considered myself a jazz musician , ” he said in 1986 , “ but a musician who occasionally played jazz . ”
 He wa born Andreas Ludwig Priwin on April 6 , 1929 , in Berlin . After his parent realized he had perfect pitch — his father had been an amateur pianist in Berlin — André entered the Berlin Conservatory when he wa 6 . His father , Jacob , a Polish-born lawyer who wa Jewish , moved the family to Paris in 1938 to escape the Nazis .
 While in Paris , Mr. Previn later recalled , he had some lesson with Marcel Dupré before the family left for Los Angeles about a year later . There , he studied with the composer and conductor Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco , the violinist and composer Joseph Achron and the composer Ernst Toch . He soon recorded all the four-hand piano music of Mozart with the composer Lukas Foss , who wa not quite seven year older than Mr. Previn .
 Mr. Previn became an American citizen in 1943 , and in 1950 he wa drafted into the Army and served with the Sixth Army Band . He also studied conducting in San Francisco with Pierre Monteux , whom he later followed at the London Symphony .
 A relative worked in the music department at Universal Studios , and Mr. Previn wrote music for movie even before he went into the Army . As a senior in high school , he wa called in to help with “ Holiday in Mexico , ” a 1946 MGM musical starring Walter Pidgeon . ( A young Fidel Castro wa an extra . ) The script called for the concert pianist Jose Iturbi to play some jazz , but he wa uncomfortable improvising and wanted a score to read . Mr. Previn went to a jam session , listened and wrote out a piano part for Mr. Iturbi to play when the camera rolled .
 MGM took notice and hired Mr. Previn to compose and conduct the music for “ The Sun Comes Up , ” starring Lassie and the once-illustrious actress Jeanette MacDonald , who wa allergic to dog . “ Go figure that billing , ” he once said .
 Years after it premiere in 1949 , he gave the movie a thumbs-down . “ Like all Lassie picture , ” he said , “ there wa hardly any dialogue , but a lot of barking . I thought it wa easy , but I have since put myself through the wringer of watching it on a television rerun , and it ’ s the most inept score you ever heard . ”
 But front-office executive realized that Mr. Previn could handle the deadline that went with studio work , and they put him on what he called “ an endless stream of cheap , fast movie . ”
 Not all his assignment fit that description . He collected Oscars for scoring “ Gigi ” ( 1959 ) , “ Porgy and Bess ” ( 1960 ) , “ Irma La Douce ” ( 1964 ) and “ My Fair Lady ” ( 1965 ) . He did not write classic song like “ Summertime ” and “ I Could Have Danced All Night ” ; rather , he arranged and orchestrated them , creating the soundtrack version .
 Like Bernstein , Mr. Previn also tried Broadway . With Alan Jay Lerner , he wrote “ Coco , ” a musical about the designer Coco Chanel that starred Katharine Hepburn and ran for 329 performance in 1969 and 1970 . He also wrote the music for “ The Good Companions , ” a musical with lyric by Johnny Mercer that ran for 252 performance in London in 1974 .
 Also like Bernstein , Mr. Previn wa a crowd-pleaser a a conductor . Five year after his surprise appointment in London , the British magazine New Statesman complained that he had given the orchestra “ a strong American accent : the big-screen sound , rich , loud and brilliant. ” But it said his program on the BBC — which prefigured by a few year the American public-television series “ Previn and the Pittsburgh , ” broadcast when he wa the music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony — had “ clearly widened his box-office appeal . ”
 “ Whereas Boulez look boring and Boult look bored , ” the magazine said , referring to the prominent conductor Pierre Boulez and Adrian Boult , “ Previn always seems to be enjoying himself . ”
 He remained principal conductor of the London Symphony until 1979 ; he wa also the principal conductor of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra from 1985 to 1988 . In the United States , he held the Pittsburgh job from 1976 to 1984 right before taking over in Los Angeles .
 Mr. Previn resigned the Los Angeles post in 1989 , complaining that the orchestra ’ s managing director , Ernest Fleischmann , had maneuvered to bring in Esa-Pekka Salonen a his successor . “ It ha become obvious to me that there is no room for a music director , ” Mr. Previn said when he quit . Mr. Salonen wa named music director-designate a few month later .
 As he approached 70 , Mr. Previn turned to opera , writing “ A Streetcar Named Desire ” to a libretto by Philip Littell based on the Tennessee Williams play . Renée Fleming sang the role of Blanche DuBois in the premiere with the San Francisco Opera in 1998 , with Mr. Previn on the podium . Bernard Holland , reviewing the performance for The New York Times , wrote that “ it sings very well . ”
 “ There are angry clash of harmony and key , ” he added , “ many Straussian gesture , sweet-as-honey popular melody and the kind of corporate noodling and mumbling among the string native to a Ligeti or a Penderecki . ”
 A recording with the San Francisco cast won the Grand Prix du Disque . Mr. Previn also won 10 competitive Grammys from 1958 to 2004 , divided evenly between classical and nonclassical category , and a lifetime achievement Grammy in 2010 .
 The second of his two opera wa “ Brief Encounter ” ( 2007 ) , with a libretto by John Caird based on Noël Coward ’ s screenplay for the 1945 David Lean film by that name .
 Toward the end of his life , Mr. Previn seemed surprised at the interest in his composition . ” I wrote a string quartet that I very diffidently mentioned to the Emerson Quartet , ” he told the critic David Patrick Stearns in 2017 . “ And they said , ‘ Where is it ? ’ I ’ m not used to that . ”
 In 2017 , Ms. Fleming gave several performance of a song cycle he wrote , “ Lyrical Yeats. ” “ These brief song display Mr. Previn ’ s keen ear for the telling detail , for musical gesture that set a mood or conjure an image , ” Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim wrote in The Times when Ms. Fleming sang them in a solo recital at Carnegie Hall .
 In 2018 , Ms . Mutter played “ The Fifth Season , ” for violin and piano , which she and Carnegie Hall had commissioned . She described it a “ rather lighthearted . ”
 This year , Tanglewood had planned event to celebrate Mr. Previn ’ s 90th birthday , including a performance of the violin concerto “ Anne-Sophie ” with Ms . Mutter and , with Ms. Fleming and the Emerson quartet , the premiere of “ Penelope , ” by Mr. Previn and the playwright Tom Stoppard . Tanglewood said the event would now be framed a a celebration of his life and work , although it wa not immediately clear if Mr. Previn had finished “ Penelope . ”
 Mr. Previn wrote several book , including “ Orchestra ” ( 1979 ) , a depiction of the life of orchestral musician , and a memoir of his movie experience , “ No Minor Chords : My Days in Hollywood ” ( 1991 ) .
 Mr. Previn ’ s first wife , Betty Bennett , wa a singer he had seen in San Francisco jazz club . They had two daughter , Claudia and Alicia , also known a Lovely ( who became a violinist in the Irish band In Tua Nua ) , and divorced in 1958 .
 His second marriage wa to Dory Langan , an MGM lyricist , who , after they separated , recorded several album a a singer-songwriter under the name Dory Previn , many of them reflection on their breakup and it aftermath . Dory Previn died in 2012 .
 Their divorce in 1970 wa prompted by the well-publicized affair between Mr. Previn and Ms. Farrow , who had been a friend of Ms. Previn ’ s . Ms. Farrow divorced Sinatra in 1968 and married Mr. Previn in 1970 . They had three child , Matthew and Sascha , who were twin , and Fletcher . They also adopted three daughter : Summer Song , known a Daisy ; Soon-Yi , who married Woody Allen in 1997 ; and Lark , who died in 2008 .
 Mr. Previn ’ s fourth wife wa Heather Hales Sneddon . They had a son , Lukas , and a daugher , Li-An , and divorced in 2002 . He and Ms . Mutter married in 2002 and divorced in 2006 but continued to perform together .
 “ You know how people say that their marriage didn ’ t work ? ” he said in 2017 . “ With u , the divorce didn ’ t work . We call each other every day regardless of where we are . Maybe she ’ s in China and I ’ m in Cincinnati , but we find each other . It ’ s like being very best friend who have a romantic history . ”
 Complete information on his survivor wa not immediately available .
 Mr. Previn seemed puzzled that critic continued to mention his Hollywood past long after he had been focusing on classical music . “ I haven ’ t done anything else since the mid- ’ 60 , ” he told The Times in 1991 . “ I think there ’ s a statute of limitation here .
 “ When I go to Tanglewood to teach , the kid don ’ t know I ever did anything else , ” he continued . “ Sometimes they see a movie on the late , late show , and they say , ‘ Who is that ? ’ And then I have to confess that the man who manufactured harp glissando for Esther Williams to dive to wa actually me . ”
 An earlier version of this obituary referred incorrectly to Mr. Previn ’ s daughter Alicia , also known a Lovely . Her mother is Mr. Previn ’ s first wife , Betty Bennett — not his second wife , Dory Langan . The earlier version also misstated the year Mr. Previn became principal conductor of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra . It wa 1985 , not 1965 .
 An earlier version or this obituary misstated Mr. Previn ’ s original surname . He wa born Andreas Ludwig Priwin , not Prewin .
 An earlier version of this obituary misspelled the given name of the writer and lyricist with whom Mr. Previn collaborated on the Broadway musical “ Coco. ” He wa Alan Jay Lerner , not Allan . The earlier version also omitted the name of one of Mr. Previn and Mia Farrow ’ s child ; in addition to those named , they had a daughter , Lark , who died in 2008 .
 An earlier version of this obituary misstated part of the name of Mr. Previn ’ s fourth wife and omitted the name of one of their child . She wa Heather Hales Sneddon , not Haines ; and in addition to their son , Lukas , they had a daughter , Li-An .
 An earlier version of this obituary misstated the year Mr. Previn and his fourth wife , Heather , divorced . It wa 2002 , not 1999 .

 At the new Surf Simply resort in Costa Rica , guest are videotaped a they catch a wave , and that ’ s only the beginning of the tech-based coaching .
 By Bonnie Tsui
 Inside one of Surf Simply resort ’ s three gleaming new glass-walled video-coaching suite , I ’ m staring at a giant screen freeze-frame of myself taking off into an overhead wave . It is a glorious shot , hair flying , stance low , a white-water trail streaming behind me to the lip of the wave .
 “ So what do we see here , Bonnie ? ” asks Jessie Carnes , one of the resort ’ s four owner and my coach for the week . What the screen doesn ’ t yet show , but what she and I both know : It ’ s the moment right before I biff the wave and fly face-first into the Pacific .
 What ’ s different from every other time I biff it face-first , though , is that this time I can see that both of my hand are coming too far forward into the turn , pitching my upper body toward the water . I say so , and Ms. Carnes reward me with a radiant grin .
 “ Exactly , ” she say , advancing the video so that we see the ensuing fall in real time . “ Keep your head up and your hand over the rail ” — left hand over the left side of the board , right hand over the right side — “ and your weight will stay over the board driving into the turn . ”
 It ’ s late November here at the brand-new Surf Simply resort in Nosara , Costa Rica , where up to eight camera were trained on me and the other 11 guest in the water during the morning ’ s surf session . Within the hour , video footage wa loaded onto the resort ’ s private server and edited into a personal highlight reel , cut with skill-building lesson that are customized for each surfer . The coach then run through a “ theory ” session with that surfer , going over the tape and running drill to improve performance .
 The founder of Surf Simply , Ru Hill , moved here from England and started teaching out of his car in 2007 ; three year later , he opened the original coaching resort a short distance from Playa Guiones , a four-mile span of white-sand beach featuring some of the most consistent surf in the world . Since then , Surf Simply ha become a premier surf destination , one that routinely get booked out a year in advance .
 Last year , Mr. Hill and his partner — Ms. Carnes , Daniela Acosta and Harry Knight — started building an ecologically thoughtful but technologically sophisticated new iteration of the resort : An intimate , minimalist building tucked under the jungle canopy , bordering the Reserva Biológica Nosara , with a walking path right to Playa Guiones . The four entrepreneur hired Gensler — the renowned San Francisco design firm behind such project a the original Apple store , Facebook headquarters and Seoul Incheon International Airport — to bring it to reality . They officially moved into the new dig a month before my visit .
 With this in mind , I can ’ t help but think that the new video-coaching room is kind of like being inside an iPhone , one that ’ s loaded with surf tutorial , raw film footage from all angle and an app for personalized analysis . Welcome to Surf Simply 2.0 .
 I live in the Bay Area and have been surfing off and on for about a decade , with two baby thrown in there . Like a lot of intermediate surfer , I ’ ve dabbled in lesson over the year , but I always wondered if there wa a better way than the ethereal , “ feel the wave ” instruction that doesn ’ t translate to actual skill . Most day , surfing seems to happens in a vacuum ; even when you have a dedicated surf posse , a I do at San Francisco ’ s Ocean Beach , there ’ s never really a reliable witness to tell you what you did , right or wrong .
 What set Surf Simply apart from other surf camp is the extreme specificity of technical instruction , and that ’ s what my three-woman surf crew — Caroline , Sarah and Harper — and I were after when we planned this trip a year and a half before . Every coaching session relies on a logical progression that instructor call the “ tree of knowledge , ” a road map of skill that connects the dot from entry-level surfer to competitor ( in the spirit of community , it ’ s available free online to anyone who want it ) .
 The daily schedule is posted on a blackboard by the open-air dining room : two-a-day surf ; lecture about surfboard mechanic , wave forecasting , etiquette and duck-diving ; stretching class by Andreina Poletti , an impossibly fit and plucky sport conditioning coach from the capital city of San José . All of it is punctuated with fresh , creative meal by the supremely gifted Denis Madrigal , who ha worked in some of New York ’ s most storied kitchen , including the Palm . Oh , and did I mention the massage , the pool and the open bar ?
 “ It ’ s a if the N.F.L . postgame practice met your honeymoon and they had a baby , ” Caroline mused on the third morning a we walked back from the beach , surfboard in hand , adjusting pace a little crab the fiery red of stop sign scuttled across our path .

 The ideal audience for this data-driven approach to surfing includes Trevor Ault , 43 , a mechanical engineer who wa visiting Surf Simply for the third time with his wife , Paige Morgan , 46 , a commercial real estate broker . “ Seven hundred and 65 calorie , ” he said proudly , showing me the morning ’ s readout on his surf app . The GPS and gyroscope inside his smartwatch helped map the zigzag course of his various wave trajectory , tallying the one he made and the one he didn ’ t , and recording wave speed , distance , time and energy expenditure for the entire session ( impressively high , thanks to the effort required to paddle over the six- to eight-foot wave that morning ) . Data , he reminded me , is your friend .
 I also met Tiffany Joh , 31 , a professional golfer on the L.P.G.A . Tour . Six year ago , she wa coming off her worst season on the tour and lost her tour card . Before starting the uphill climb to requalify , she took a week off from golf and learned to surf . She now visit Surf Simply during every off season to improve her skill .
 “ Surfing and golf are similar in that they are so frustrating : You ’ re waiting for 95 percent of the time , but then you ’ ll get one really good wave or hit one really good shot , and you ’ ll feel amazing , ” she said , laughing . “ They ’ re also both very technical . Golf is about reading slope on the green , matching speed with your line . There ’ s creativity in how you do that , but you need the technical fundamental first . Same with surfing : You need the fundamental before you can get creative and ‘ feel the wave . ’ ”
 I think about how much golf and ski magazine are devoted to improving your skill , whether it ’ s putting or backcountry safety . Then I think about surf magazine , which are almost entirely devoted to pretty aquamarine picture of wave with awesome surfer on them . Here in Nosara , you have the chance to live inside that pretty picture , with the technical tool to help you belong there .
 Everything about the resort itself enables this flow to and from the ocean , with an emphasis on indoor-outdoor living . Guests can select any surfboard they like from the board room , a spacious , teak-beamed shed , and place their pick on rack under little chalkboard marked with their name . The beach path is adjacent to the board room , and three outdoor shower are situated right at the step back up to the resort ’ s pool and hot tub . Each guest room is designed for the surfer returning from a session ; the generous glass-walled shower ha numerous hook inside and out , to hang rash guard and suit .
 One morning in the pre-dawn hour , I appreciated the unexpected juxtaposition of jazz piping out of the dining room with the raawrerRAAAWRrerroarerrawer of howler monkey in the tree 15 foot overhead . Later , I saw one howler curled up into a tiny ball on a branch above the pool , and marveled at what a big sound a little monkey can make .
 The entire operation will be platinum LEED-certified and try to have a light footprint . Nearly half it energy need are supplied by rooftop solar , and wastewater is used for irrigation , eliminating sewage output and saving more than 50 percent in public water use over the previous resort . Mr. Hill and his team are also relaunching their child ’ s surf camp , offering free lesson and video coaching every Saturday morning to encourage local child to join the beach community . One student from the original child ’ s camp is about to come full circle , returning to Surf Simply a a newly hired 21-year-old instructor .
 A week at Surf Simply start at about $ 4,500 per person , double occupancy ( $ 3,500 if your partner doesn ’ t surf ) , including lodging , food , drink , massage , photo and video footage and transport to and from the airport . How doe one justify the cost of professional coaching a a nonprofessional ? Here , I think again about golf and skiing — green fee alone can top $ 2,000 for seven day , and what of lesson , lift ticket , gear , lodging , meal and all the rest ? Caroline , Harper , Sarah and I decided that amortizing the cost of happiness over a lifetime of surfing make the trip more than worthwhile ; we ’ d have load of new skill to take home with u to practice , and surfing on our home break cost nearly nothing .
 By and large , though , people keep coming back for more : Mr. Hill said that 37 percent of guest are return visitor , many of whom come back in the company of those they ’ ve met here . One all-star guest , Reid Winkler , an orthodontist from Seattle , had traveled to Surf Simply a record 12 time and already had his next two trip scheduled . “ I ’ ve made a lot of good friend here , ” he told me . “ It ’ s the school for surf nerd — but it ’ s the coolest nerd you ’ ve ever met . ”
 Bruce and Abby Hutchinson , from New London , N.H. , were on their fourth trip to Surf Simply . Before their first visit , in 2015 , they had never been surfing . “ We love to try new thing , ” said Mr. Hutchinson , 63 , said . They liked the thrill of riding wave , and they also liked the effort to demystify it . “ Here , the objective is not to just stand up on the board , but to get better every time . ”
 “ It ’ s the cumulation of sound instruction in skill and the confidence to work on something new , with the group cheering you on , ” added Mrs. Hutchinson , 62 . “ That ’ s really special . ”
 It wa during Ms. Carnes ’ s breath-hold lecture — lying down in the stretching room with friend both new and old , entering the third minute of holding my breath while pretending to be held under by a giant wave — that it came to me : This wa the ultimate Venn diagram of surfing and geekery . And I had never felt more at home .

 Could playing the ringmaster in the new “ Dumbo ” be an allegory for our political circus ?

 HOLLYWOOD — Danny DeVito ha a spoon hanging off his nose .
 He ’ s trying to impress the beautiful woman having dinner at the next table at Craig ’ s , the Hollywood clubhouse . And it ’ s working . She ’ s cracking up .
 But a mere utensil is not enough to hold Jennifer Lopez ’ s attention for long . Soon , J-Lo swing back around to return her focus to A-Rod . Their engagement is on deck , after all .
 When I meet up with Mr. DeVito for an interview the next night at the Palm , he explains that he wa not trying to come between J-Rod .
 “ No , she had her eye glued to him , ” Mr. DeVito say , laughing . “ But I think everybody did . It wa kind of cool. ” He say he ’ s friendly with J-Lo because his company , Jersey Films , produced her best movie , “ Out of Sight , ” also starring George Clooney .
 Sipping cranberry juice with club soda and eating Chilean sea bass , Mr. DeVito is a far more civilized dining companion than his character in “ It ’ s Always Sunny in Philadelphia , ” Frank Reynolds , who would no doubt order the most expensive bottle of wine , guzzle the whole thing , wave around a gun , wax nostalgic about the time he waterboarded his daughter in a urinal and then skip out on the check with a doggie bag of bacon bit for lovemaking later with a girlfriend who like to role play that she ’ s a Cobb salad .
 “ She ’ s really rough , ” Mr. DeVito crow to me about his TV girlfriend , bragging that they have sex in a dumpster . “ I like a little bit of that . ”
 Frank is in a pantheon of delicious vulgarian played by Mr. DeVito , character who compress the seven deadly sin into one compact package , yet somehow still charm .
 A native of Asbury Park , N.J. , Mr. DeVito became a TV star in 1978 a Louie De Palma , the lewd , loud taxi dispatcher , for five season in “ Taxi ” and this year will begin filming his 13th season a the lewd , loud Frank in “ It ’ s Always Sunny . ”
 “ Tinseltown ’ s Tiny Terror , ” a Time once nicknamed him ( he ha called himself “ the five-feet guy ” ) , ha also had an extraordinarily long , successful career a a producer , director and actor in indie and big-budget film , most recently a Max Medici in Tim Burton ’ s “ Dumbo , ” a reimagining of the 1941 Disney classic , which open next week .
 “ Danny ’ s just got a good Felliniesque spirit about him that make you want to be around him , ” say Mr. Burton , who ha directed the “ DeVito trilogy ’ ’ of the actor a top-hatted ringmaster in “ Batman Returns , ” “ Big Fish ” and now “ Dumbo. ” ( Mr. Burton say that the film , featuring a very woke circus and an adorable C.G.I . blue-eyed baby elephant , won ’ t upset those who swore off circus because of elephant abuse , noting , “ As a child , I felt very uneasy about the circus for that reason . ” )
 [ RELATED : Maureen Dowd play a game with Danny DeVito . ]
 Michael Keaton , who ha a dastardly turn in “ Dumbo ” a an archcapitalist , say he marveled that when Mr. DeVito played Oswald Cobblepot , better known a the Penguin , in the 1992 film “ Batman Returns , ” he created an entire garden outside his trailer , with beautiful hedge , potted plant , a chair and a table for water , where he presided , doing “ his Danny thing , his Jersey funny , irreverent thing . ”
 Robert De Niro , who met Mr. DeVito in an equity picket line in the rain at a theater in the Village when they were in their mid-20s , admired his fellow Italian so much that he called to ask him for tip before he directed “ A Bronx Tale . ”
 Basically , Mr. De Niro tell me , Mr. DeVito ’ s advice boiled down to : “ Don ’ t worry . ”
 It is a measure of Mr. DeVito ’ s magnetic presence that , despite his diminutive stature , he ha said he wa never bullied a a child . The first time he emerges from the dispatcher ’ s cage in “ Taxi , ” the audience erupts into shocked laughter , because his height is such a contrast with his character ’ s outsize confidence and belligerence .
 Mr. DeVito say his older sister , Angie and Theresa , filled him with self-esteem . Angie brought him into her salon and taught him to do hair . He wa affectionately nicknamed “ Mr . Dan . ”
 “ They loved me , yeah , ” he say . “ They treated me like a little prince . ”
 A former altar boy , he is described by friend a a Tasmanian devil . “ He ha no fear , ” say Michael Douglas , an old friend and former roommate . “ He will comedically take any chance , and he savor darkness . ”
 Mr. DeVito ha been nude on film twice , once in “ Big Fish , ” when his ringmaster turn from a werewolf back into a man , and once on “ Always Sunny , ” when he bust out of a leather couch he ’ s hiding in looking like a greased-up halibut .
 “ I ’ m no Willem Dafoe , ” he say blithely , but “ I ’ m not shy about taking my clothes off . ”
 I tell him about a young guy in Boston who is such a big fan that he bought a 1996 Chevy Lumina van and named it Vanny DeVito . He tattooed it on his leg and printed out bumper sticker of Mr. DeVito ’ s face to hand out on a cross-country trip .
 He ’ s unfazed . “ Oh , yeah , ” he say . “ I know about these thing . They ’ re all over the place . There wa a girl last year who took me to her prom with the cardboard cutout of me . I wa her date . I love all that stuff .
 “ You know , I did a movie called ‘ The Van ’ one time . It wa like a low-budget people-in-a-van movie . ”
 When a sophomore at SUNY Purchase constructed a DeVito altar made from trash in a men ’ s room last year , Mr. DeVito tweeted , “ Your shrine honor me . My heart is filled with love and garbage . ”
 He wa a pioneering meme lord with his # trollfoot , picture of his right foot out and about : from moment of repose , drinking wine on the beach , to painted in rainbow color to match his feather boa on a float at the Los Angeles pride parade last year .
 “ My first tweet wa : ‘ My nut are on fire , ’ ” he recall . “ And then what am I going to do ? So I started taking picture of my foot and sticking it online . ”
 Mr. DeVito ha been in many great movie : “ L.A . Confidential , ” “ Tin Men , ” “ Get Shorty , ” “ Twins , ” “ Ruthless People , ” “ Man on the Moon , ” “ Romancing the Stone , ” “ Terms of Endearment , ” “ One Flew Over the Cuckoo ’ s Nest , ” “ Matilda ” and “ War of the Roses , ” which he also directed . And he ha produced several , including “ Gattaca ” and “ Erin Brockovich . ”
 He bought a script sight unseen from a fledgling filmmaker in the 1990s because he had liked the young man ’ s first movie script and wanted to do whatever wa next . “ A year later — and it wa a long year — he finally showed up with 155 page , ” Mr. DeVito recall . “ It said , ‘ “ Pulp Fiction ” by Quentin Tarantino : Final Draft. ’ So I sat down in a comfortable chair and I read it . And I wa blown away by it . I thought it wa hysterical . ”
 I tell him that “ Dumbo ” is well timed for a Trump era , when the circus , clown and elephant-in-the-room metaphor are flying fast and thick . Mr. DeVito himself ha referred to both the president and Democrats a “ clowns. ” ( Except for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , whom he hail a “ a gift . ” )
 Mr. DeVito , who like to listen to “ Democracy Now ” and is reading “ Democracy in Chains : The Deep History of the Radical Right ’ s Stealth Plan for America , ” say he will campaign for Bernie Sanders , a he did in 2016 , and that he ’ d like to see him run with Tulsi Gabbard .
 “ If you look back on that election , a lot of his progressive idea are accepted now , ” he say . “ Like free college education . Yale ’ s not going to be free , we know that , right ? ” Indeed we do , thanks to Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin . “ I didn ’ t go to any college . Forgive the debt , so people can live their life and not feel they ’ re under a wet blanket . Let ’ s let the sun shine . We have a beautiful country . We got a lot of resource . You know , Medicare for all . What ’ s the big deal ? Why not open that up ?
 “ We got to take a big breath and move on and get out of this muck and mire . I don ’ t wish anybody ill , but I think it would be a good thing to get a lot of people out of our government . Let them go fishing or someplace south , stick them on a farm somewhere , and get our country moving . The one that are there now are really stinking up the joint . ”
 Many liberal in the Twittersphere regard Mr. DeVito ’ s succinct 2013 tweet a certified platinum : “ Antonin Scalia retire bitch. ” Even more gratifying than when he went on “ The View ” in 2006 , after a long night of downing Limoncello with Mr. Clooney , and blurted out that George W. Bush wa a “ numb nut ” and that he and his wife , Rhea Perlman , had enjoyed a wild night in the Lincoln Bedroom when Bill Clinton wa president .
 He ha occasionally leavened his loathsome but lovable little men by playing a romantic lead . But Mr. DeVito relish villain . Not gangster , but crazy con men and ne ’ er-do-wells in black comedy .
 I wonder if kid ever get scared if they see him on the street and realize he ’ s the really mean dad from “ Matilda . ”
 “ No , it ’ s cool , ” he say . “ The mother usually say , ‘ He ’ s O.K . He ’ s not going to hurt you . ’ ”
 He say playing the Penguin wa the biggest kick , even though a monkey went wild on the set , “ leapt at my ball and grabbed me . It wa the scariest thing . They had to rip him off . ”
 Other than that , he recall , “ It wa a lot of fun . You got to put all the clothes on and the suit and the mask . It ’ s like real commedia dell ’ arte . We all hide behind mask anyway . And you add something else onto that , which is like a beak , flipper , and you live in the sewer and you drool black crap out of your mouth . ”
 He is very relieved that the monkey in “ Dumbo ” is C.G.I .
 At 74 , Mr. DeVito ha separated from Ms. Perlman , his wife of 37 year , and split his time between a house in Los Angeles and an apartment in New York .
 “ I get to see everybody , ” he say . “ I see Rhea . I see the kid . I just live apart . ”
 He said he hasn ’ t checked out Tinder , adding dryly : “ I rely on the kindness of stranger . ”
 He seems carefree . Asked about the Net-azon streampocalypse underway in Hollywood , where many people were privately breathing a sigh of relief that Netflix ’ s “ Roma ” did not win the Oscar for best movie , Mr. DeVito shrug . He caught only some of the Academy Awards on TV because he wa busy barbecuing .
 “ I ’ m just looking for a good story , ” he say . “ And a good book . And a good screenplay . Work with people that you like . Go to dinner . Go on vacation . Have a good time . Yeah , no stress . Vote for Bernie Sanders . ”
 He wa equally nonchalant about the racial politics roiling the town in the wake of “ Green Book ” beating “ BlacKkKlansman ” for best picture , which caused Spike Lee to try to storm out of the auditorium .
 “ I have nothing to say about ‘ Green Book ’ and ‘ BlacKkKlansman , ’ ” he say . “ But I do know that we are a bunch of racist . ”
 I ask Mr. DeVito , father to two daughter and a son , if Hollywood ha changed in the wake of # MeToo .
 “ The only thing I can say is I ’ ve talked to woman about this and what I come away with is four word : ‘ Women must be heard. ’ That ’ s my mantra . Is that five word ? No , four word . It ’ s like I say to my agent every day , the magic four word : ‘ Get me a job. ’ Come on ! ”
 Are studio mogul just waiting to resume their bad old way when the umbrage abates ?
 “ Well , we ’ re all suffragette , ” he say . “ We got to get woman equal pay . We got to get ’ em on the map . We got to respect ’ em . We got to keep our hand off ’ em unless they beg for it . ”
 Mr. DeVito produced and acted in “ Man on the Moon ” with Jim Carrey , about the late comedian Andy Kaufman , who played Latka Gravas on “ Taxi. ” He recall the day when Kaufman used to belittle and then wrestle with woman delivering U.P.S . package to the “ Taxi ” set .
 “ He ’ d say , ‘ Why are you taking a job away from a man ? You should be in the kitchen cooking ! You know how many men need a job ? You ’ re taking a job ! Go on , what are you going to do , honey ? ’ And they would wrestle him .
 “ I actually thought , in hindsight , that Andy wa having u on . Now that I know everything about him , it ’ s not out of the question that Andy got a woman , got her a costume , gave her a big package with nothing in it , and had her act like a U.P.S . person . ”
 He say the best way to thrive in Hollywood is to not focus on all the jerk and talentless hack and insecurity .
 “ It ’ s like going through the jungle , ” he say . “ You hear all the sound . Somebody ’ s being eaten on the other side of a plant . But you got to just stay on your path . ”
 Before we go , Mr. DeVito take a stab at teaching me how to hang a spoon on my nose . “ Clean it off first , ” he instructs . “ You have to breathe on it , something about the condensation . ”
 I tell him that I ’ ll probably see him out on the road with Bernie Sanders .
 “ He ’ ll be the tall one , ” Mr. DeVito say , and jauntily wave goodbye .

 William P. Barr ha long espoused an unfettered vision of executive power . He may soon serve a president not known for self-restraint .
 By Charlie Savage
 WASHINGTON — The meeting of President George Bush ’ s cabinet on Jan. 8 , 1991 , wa even more high-stakes than usual . Iraq had invaded Kuwait . Half a million American troop were deployed and ready to attack . But many lawmaker were demanding a vote before any war .
 Rejecting mainstream constitutional view , William P. Barr , the deputy attorney general , told Mr. Bush that he wielded unfettered power to start a major land war on his own — not only without congressional permission , but even if Congress voted against it .
 “ Mr . President , there ’ s no doubt that you have the authority to launch an attack , ” Mr. Barr said , a he later recalled .
 Ultimately , Mr. Bush wa cautious about invoking that maximalist theory of executive power and asked lawmaker for support anyway — a prudent step that Mr. Barr , whom Mr. Bush soon elevated to attorney general , also recommended . Congress ’ s vote ensured the Persian Gulf war wa lawful .
 Nearly three decade later , President Trump ha nominated Mr. Barr to return a attorney general . But unlike the self-restrained Mr. Bush , Mr. Trump revel in pushing limit — a temperament that , when combined with Mr. Barr ’ s unusually permissive understanding of presidential power , could play out very differently for the rule of law than it did last time .
 “ There are concern about his independence , given his longstanding and expansive view of executive power , ” said Senator Dianne Feinstein of California , the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee , which will hold Mr. Barr ’ s confirmation hearing starting Tuesday . “ So the question is , Is he right for this time , and can he really be independent of this president and the White House ? ”
 Mr. Trump ousted his administration ’ s first attorney general , Jeff Sessions , in November , after long excoriating him for having followed ethic official ’ advice that he recuse himself from overseeing what became the investigation led by the special counsel , Robert S. Mueller III . Mr. Trump said that he needed an attorney general who would protect him and that he would not have appointed Mr . Sessions if he had known he would recuse himself .
 The two-day hearing for Mr. Barr , 68 , will play out against the backdrop of swelling rule-of-law turmoil , from Mr. Trump ’ s pressuring the Justice Department to curtail investigation into his associate and to open them into his opponent to his threat to invoke emergency power to circumvent Congress on border-wall fund , to coming oversight fight with House Democrats .
 Democrats have demanded that Mr. Barr protect Mr. Mueller a he completes the investigation into Russia ’ s interference in the 2016 election , including whether Mr. Trump sought to obstruct the inquiry on behalf of Moscow . Democrats have also focused on whether Mr. Barr would turn over to Congress any report Mr. Mueller compiles .
 Senator Lindsey Graham , Republican of South Carolina and the new Judiciary Committee chairman , told reporter after meeting with Mr. Barr last week that the nominee had said he saw no reason to fire Mr. Mueller and had pledged to “ err on the side of transparency ” about any report . But neither statement addressed what he would do if Mr. Trump ordered him to act otherwise .
 Mr. Barr is likely to be confirmed because Republicans control the Senate and because defeating him would leave in place the acting attorney general , Matthew G. Whitaker , a Trump loyalist whose installation in that role Democrats see a illegitimate and a threat to Mr. Mueller . Ethics official advised Mr. Whitaker to recuse himself from the Russia case , but he refused .
 But Mr. Barr ha already drawn scrutiny over the revelation last month that he sent an apparently unsolicited 19-page memo to the Trump legal team in June arguing that Mr. Mueller should not be permitted to investigate Mr. Trump for criminal obstruction of justice .
 Mr. Barr ’ s argument derived from his broad view of executive power : The Constitution , he claimed , doe not permit Congress to make it a crime for the president to exercise his executive power corruptly — even if he were to fire a subordinate , pardon someone or use what Mr. Barr termed his “ complete authority to start or stop a law enforcement proceeding ” to cover up crime by himself or his associate .
 The claim that the framer of the Constitution empowered president to impede investigation for corrupt end go too far , many legal scholar say . But Supreme Court precedent offer few definitive guidepost , giving the attorney general broad latitude .
 “ The interpretive approach of Justice Department lawyer to the Constitution is very important because many separation-of-powers issue never wind up in court , ” said Peter Shane , an Ohio State University law professor . “ Barr ’ s method is not uniquely his , but it doe represent a particularly aggressive school of executive power thought . ”
 Mr. Barr started his career a a C.I.A . analyst before becoming an agency legislative affair official in the mid-1970s , during the post-Watergate and post-Vietnam War era when a congressional investigation dragged decade of intelligence abuse into the light over the executive branch ’ s objection .
 After going to law school , he joined the Reagan White House and worked on domestic policy with C. Boyden Gray , the counsel to then-Vice President George Bush . At the time , the administration wa battling Democrats in Congress over it push for deregulation . The conflict helped spur the Reagan legal team to develop new executive power theory that would diminish the influence of Congress .
 Their legal policy innovation intensified in Mr. Reagan ’ s second term , after Mr. Barr had returned to private practice and senior administration official were caught steering aid to anti-Marxist militant in Nicaragua despite a law forbidding such assistance . The scandal , known a Iran-contra , set off investigation by Congress and an independent counsel .
 Amid the fallout , the Reagan legal team called into question the legitimacy of both the law barring aid and one allowing for prosecutor the president could not fire . The president ’ s lawyer saw them a congressional encroachment on the president ’ s rightful power , though the Supreme Court upheld the independent counsel law in 1988 .
 The next year , when Mr. Barr returned to public service in the new Bush administration , he took up the executive power mission a the head of the Office of Legal Counsel , the powerful agency within the Justice Department that evaluates the legality of proposed executive branch action . Mr. Gray , who had become White House counsel under Mr. Bush , “ wa intent on getting someone in that position who believed in executive authority , ” Mr. Barr later recalled .
 Normally , the Office of Legal Counsel wait to be asked a specific legal question about a particular dispute before weighing in . But among his first major act wa to write an apparently unsolicited 10-page memo to top lawyer across the executive branch , urging vigilance against any attempt by Congress to limit presidential power .
 “ Only by consistently and forcefully resisting such congressional incursion can executive branch prerogative be preserved , ” he wrote .
 Mr. Barr denounced lawmaker ’ pursuit of sensitive administration information for oversight investigation and the creation of legal limit on the president ’ s power to fire certain official in order to give them a degree of independence . “ The power to remove is the power to control , ” he wrote .
 As Mr. Bush ’ s term progressed , Mr. Barr not only argued that the president could unilaterally launch the gulf war without Congress — echoing a move by President Harry S. Truman , to enduring legal controversy , in the Korean War four decade earlier — but also sought to push the boundary of presidential flexibility in many other way , large and small .
 In 1990 , for example , Mr. Barr asserted that the Bush administration could lawfully choose to disregard a law in which Congress , a a condition of funding a diplomatic delegation , required that a representative from a congressional panel be included . Arguing that Congress had no authority in the area of foreign affair , he asserted that it wa therefore “ self-evidently ” true that lawmaker could not enact a law influencing the president ’ s choice of diplomatic agent .
 That same year , he argued more broadly in a panel discussion that even with the power of the purse , lawmaker lack the authority to influence policy by placing condition on appropriation for government activity that fall under the president ’ s executive power . Ultimately , Congress only ha the power to provide a “ lump sum ” to the president in those case , he said .
 After Mr. Bush lost the 1992 election and before he left office , he pardoned half a dozen official caught up in the Iran-contra affair just before one , Caspar Weinberger , wa about to go to trial . Foreshadowing the controversy over Mr. Trump ’ s dangling of potential pardon in the Russia investigation , the prosecutor accused Mr. Bush of a cover-up that could have implicated his own conduct . Mr. Barr later said that he had personally urged Mr. Bush to pardon the official because he thought they had been “ unjustly treated . ”
 In the year after the Bush administration ended , Mr. Barr became a top lawyer for the telecommunication company that evolved into Verizon , working mainly on business and regulatory issue . But he also continued to play a role in legal policy debate over executive power and national security , especially after the Sept. 11 attack .
 After Congress enacted the USA Patriot Act to loosen restriction on government surveillance that grew out of the 1970s oversight investigation , he testified that the new statute had been a good first step but did not go far enough .
 In 2005 , after the George W. Bush administration ’ s detainee abuse started coming to light , he defended Mr. Bush ’ s power to declare that prisoner in the war on terror were not protected by the Geneva Conventions and so could be lawfully subjected to coercive questioning .
 “ Generally , under the law of war , absent treaty , there is nothing wrong with coercive interrogation , applying pain , discomfort and other thing to make people talk , ” he said , pausing , then adding , “ a long a it doesn ’ t cross the line and involve the gratuitous barbarity that ’ s involved in torture . ”
 Later that year , Congress tightened law against treating detainee in cruel or degrading way , but Mr. Bush claimed he had constitutional power to do so anyway . In 2006 , the Supreme Court ruled that the Geneva Conventions did require humane treatment of terrorism detainee , contrary to the Bush legal team theory that Mr. Barr had echoed .
 Mr. Barr also repeatedly defended Mr. Bush ’ s decision to create the ill-fated system of military commission instead of civilian court to prosecute terrorism suspect . In fact , it wa Mr. Barr who privately suggested to the Bush White House that it create a tribunal system , an idea he had considered a attorney general during the investigation of the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 . Two Libyan suspect were indicted in civilian court in 1991 .
 Mr. Barr ha recounted a story about that case that may resonate with Democrats ’ expressed concern about whether he will maintain Justice Department independence against political interference by Mr. Trump . When prosecutor were preparing to indict the Pan Am 103 suspect , Mr. Bush cautiously asked his attorney general “ would it be O.K. ” to brief the National Security Council on the situation .
 Taken aback at Mr. Bush ’ s hands-off attitude , Mr. Barr made clear that he saw the president a excessively deferential — and invoked the notion , popular among executive power maximalists , that the president , not the attorney general , is the prosecutor in chief .
 “ Would it be O.K. ? Well , I work for you ; you ’ re the top law enforcement officer . Of course it ’ s O.K. , ” Mr. Barr recalled marveling . “ The attitude wa , You have to be very careful with pending matter of justice . ”

 By the Book
 The author of novel including “ In the Time of the Butterflies , ” just reissued for it 25th anniversary , ha always been taken with Milton ’ s Satan : “ Sorry , God , but he got the better part . ”
 What book are on your nightstand ?
 I don ’ t store book on my nightstand , or I ’ d have even worse problem with insomnia . How can I sleep when I could be reading ?
 What ’ s the last great book you read ?
 My reading friend are worn out with hearing me extol Jenny Erpenbeck ’ s “ Go , Went , Gone , ” a stunning novel about a retired classic professor who slowly becomes conscientizado — I love the word in Spanish — aware and involved in the plight of refugee from Africa camping out in a square in Berlin . The novel is lyrical , absorbing , so accurate a to the way we resist engagement and then are pulled in .
 Are there any classic novel that you only recently read for the first time ?
 Not sure how classic Graham Greene ’ s “ The Quiet American ” is ? But it wa one of the cult ( not quite the same a classic ) novel of my ’ 60 Vietnam War generation , and I took it with me on a recent trip to Vietnam . I wa left with great admiration for the economy and assurance of the writing , a well a the depiction of how Americans and other outsider meddle with a culture , with devastating historical fallout for all involved .
 What do you read when you ’ re working on a book ? And what kind of reading do you avoid while writing ?
 I ’ m always reading when I ’ m writing , especially book that can teach me something I ’ m trying to do . Say I need help throwing a dinner party while at the same time focusing on an intense one-on-one conversation ; I ’ ll reread “ Mrs . Dalloway ” or “ The Dead ” or a party scene from any of the Austen novel . A torture scene , I go to Robert Stone ’ s “ A Flag for Sunrise ” ; a manic-obsessed point of view , Stephen Dixon ’ s “ Interstate ” ; economy of detail and seemingly simple style that cover a lot of ground , William Trevor ’ s story or , of course , Chekhov ’ s . I don ’ t necessarily avoid any kind of book , but after a certain point , I have to say : Hey , that ’ s enough ! You don ’ t need to read one more book about the hidden language of fan in the 18th century . It ’ s just so tempting to postpone the writing .
 What ’ s the most interesting thing you learned from a book recently ?
 Often it ’ s not factual information that catch my eye , but some insight or accuracy of expression , phrasing , and I end up writing the passage down . Someone picking up my journal might rightly think it ’ s just a collection of favorite quote and passage . On a recent gig , I stayed at the writer ’ s room in a hotel whose shelf were stocked with book by former writer guest . I picked up a book by an author I didn ’ t know , Beth Ann Fennelly ’ s “ Heating & Cooling. ” It wa full of such little explosion of language and awareness : One man wa described a a hard worker who worked from “ can to can ’ t. ” Just this morning , in a Rafael Campo poem , I wa taken by his description of jogging on a treadmill a “ that exercise in getting nowhere fast. ” At such moment , I end up stroking the page .
 What book would you recommend to somebody who want to learn more about the Dominican Republic ?
 I always find novel a great way to understand the character , not just the content , of a culture . Dominican-American novelist who write about the island , not just the immigration experience : Junot Díaz , Nelly Rosario , Angie Cruz . Mario Vargas Llosa ’ s “ The Feast of the Goat ” owes much to the riveting nonfiction account by Bernard Diederich , “ Trujillo : The Death of the Goat. ” Crassweller ’ s “ Trujillo : The Life and Times of a Caribbean Dictator. ” But how can we write about the Dominican Republic and not include Haiti ? We are one island , after all , sharing a history of occupation , appropriation , slavery , dictatorship and more . Michele Wucker ’ s “ Why the Cocks Fight ” is a compact history of both country and their relationship . I also admire Madison Smartt Bell ’ s “ Haitian Revolution ” trilogy , and “ The Farming of Bones , ” by one of my favorite writer , the Haitian-American Edwidge Danticat . Ditto for how can we write about Hispaniola and not include most of the southern American hemisphere , and for that , the incomparable Eduardo Galeano ’ s book , most saliently “ Open Veins of Latin America : Five Centuries of the Pillage of a Continent , ” in which Haiti and the Dominican Republic figure frequently .
 What move you most in a work of literature ?
 Accuracy of language and perception — the writer is not striving for effect and get out of the way to let u see the world through the lens of language . I love what the poet Stanley Kunitz said about dreaming of “ an art so transparent that you can look through and see the world. ” That pretty much sum up what I most admire in a work of literature . But it begin with the incantation of the voice of the narrative — not always the same a the voice of a character or point of view . That voice get in my head and for day , even after finishing the book , it is curating my life a I move through it .
 Which genre do you especially enjoy reading ? And which do you avoid ?
 I ’ m in love with a form I call “ the short poetic novel ” — short lyrical novel that might almost be classed novella but they tip over into something deeper , more expansive , the way a 17-syllable haiku open up and flood the imagination . Novels like William Trevor ’ s “ Reading Turgenev , ” Kent Haruf ’ s “ Our Souls at Night , ” Julie Otsuka ’ s “ The Buddha in the Attic , ” Ron Hansen ’ s “ Mariette in Ecstasy , ” Colm Toibin ’ s “ The Testament of Mary , ” Flaubert ’ s “ A Simple Heart , ” Gwendolyn Brooks ’ s “ Maud Martha , ” David Malouf ’ s “ Ransom , ” Graham Swift ’ s “ Mothering Sunday , ” Bill Schubart ’ s “ Lila & Theron ” — oh Lord , there are so many good one . Before I die I want to write one . They ’ re impossibly difficult to write . The old saw — If I ’ d had more time I would have written a shorter letter — applies .
 How do you like to read ? Paper or electronic ? One book at a time or simultaneously ? Morning or night ?
 You ’ ll realize from my point above about stroking the cover of book , I need a physical text . If I stroke my iPad all kind of thing appear or disappear on the screen . I read all the time — whenever and wherever I can , and in all genre . I like to start the writing day with poetry ; like the choir master sounding a note on his pipe , it set the standard high ( “ No approximate word in a poem , ” Dickinson say ) and put me in the right register . Novels are great for break — a reward and relief from the labor of writing . I even have a stack of journals/nonfiction that I read when I ’ m brushing my teeth . ( My dentist marvel at how healthy my gum look . ) I also read seasonally . Every January , I like to reread Eliot ’ s “ Four Quartets. ” From my many decade a a teacher , who only had long summer to delve into one author ’ s total opus , I still use summer to focus on a single author ’ s collected work . Most recently , everything by Elizabeth Bishop with the superb guidance of Colm Toibin ’ s “ On Elizabeth Bishop . ”
 How do you organize your book ?
 My shelf are a mess ! But just a Salomé Ureña , the Dominican Emily Dickinson , used to tell her fussy husband , Francisco , “ Stop organizing my chaos , ” my chaotic shelf have a certain order . I suppose I have zone : poetry and fiction for my writing studio . History in the basement ( no offense to historian ) , music and art book and child ’ s book and cookbook in the main room . Hallway , multicultural book and religion and mythology .
 What book might people be surprised to find on your shelf ?
 I have a bit of an obsession with Gilgamesh , the earliest surviving work of literature , which come to u in fragment . Not that people should be surprised if I owned a copy or two by different translator , but I have a whole shelf of adaptation and translation . There ’ s something I find compelling about the story : what make a human ( e ) being , what constitutes bravery , how do we deal with loss , the transformative possibility of love . I first got hooked with Herbert Mason ’ s adaptation , then found David Ferry ’ s excellent translation , Yusef Komunyakaa ’ s verse play , Gardner/Maier ’ s translation , Stephen Mitchell ’ s poetic interpretation . There ’ s even a graphic novel version by Kent and Kevin Dixon . The fact that the story ha survived this long in so many rendition mean I ’ m not the only one captivated by this ancient story .
 What ’ s the best book you ’ ve ever received a a gift ?
 When I wa a little girl growing up in the Dominican Republic in an oral culture , I never read much of anything . I found book boring , a poor substitute for what wa going on around me — a natural world full of vibrant , captivating flora and fauna ( tarantula , moriviví plant , Carolina flower like hot-pink shaving brush ) , ciguapas , santeras who got mounted by spirit and told the future . But then my auntie , Tití , who wa the reader in the family , gave me a picture book version of “ The Arabian Nights , ” and I wa smitten . Scheherazade , the young heroine , wa a girl who looked Dominican , dark eyed , dark hair , olive skin . Then , the whole idea of a girl saving her life and that of all woman in the kingdom and transforming a cruel sultan by telling story . That book put a luminous bit of information in my head : that story have power , that they can transform you and save you .
 Who is your favorite fictional hero or heroine ? Your favorite antihero or villain ?
 Some of the first book I read in English were the Nancy Drew mystery . I found Nancy ’ s situation enviable : a hands-off papi , a doting housekeeper , a boyfriend who disappeared when you didn ’ t need him , a little roadster , no mami telling her what she could and couldn ’ t do . But my all-time favorite is Scheherazade of “ The Arabian Nights , ” who saved her life and that of the woman in her kingdom by telling story . As for villain , I have always been guiltily taken — Catholic girlhood residue — with Satan in “ Paradise Lost , ” complicated , tortured , verbally dazzling . Sorry , God , but he got the better part .
 What kind of reader were you a a child ? Which childhood book and author stick with you most ?
 I wasn ’ t a reader at all . Most book I encountered were textbook , schoolbook , the dull , censored reading material of a dictatorship . But also it wa an oral culture : People told story and the experience wa communal , not solitary and text-based . It wasn ’ t until I came into English that I became a reader . I recall those Nancy Drew mystery , and also “ Little Women ” and “ Alice in Wonderland ” ( which I felt wa a perfect description of the shape-shifting immigrant experience ) .
 If you could require the president to read one book , what would it be ?
 Probably best to choose a child ’ s book ( which I think would be the president ’ s speed , not too many word , lot of picture ) . How about Innosanto Nagara ’ s subversive primer , “ A Is for Activist. ” Or even better , I ’ d try the Arabian Nights approach : Put Sultan Trump in a room with dozen of fabulous storyteller . One thousand and one night of cliff-hanging story — actually we would only need about 600 night , to keep him occupied until after the next election . You go first .
 You ’ re organizing a literary dinner party . Which three writer , dead or alive , do you invite ?
 What greater intimacy and communion than reading their book ? I wouldn ’ t necessarily invite writer of book I love to a dinner party . I ’ d hate for their behavior to disappoint me or tarnish my love of their work .
 Disappointing , overrated , just not good : What book did you feel a if you were supposed to like , and didn ’ t ? Do you remember the last book you put down without finishing ?
 Writing is hard work , a huge commitment of time , energy , faith , passion , and there ’ s nothing shameful in the attempt , even if the work doesn ’ t end up succeeding . I ’ d rather let someone else do the public culling — I ’ m exacting enough in private . Also , when I ’ ve fallen in love with a writer , I want to read everything she ’ s written , even title that are flawed , because I ’ m interested in that sensibility , style , way of looking at the world . Often , the new work or old work isn ’ t a successful a that first book that won my devotion . It ’ s a relief , actually , and confirms what I know from experience : that writing is a vocation and a practice over a lifetime , with it ups and down . It teach me humility , the great democracy of each time having to start over .
 Whom would you want to write your life story ?
 I ’ ve already infused my work with my life . Enough about me . Let them tackle another subject .
 How do you decide what to read next ? Is it review , word-of-mouth , book by friend , book for research ? Does it depend on mood or do you plot in advance ?
 I have several friend whose recommendation I trust . These friend often tease me because I bring my small notebook to dinner party to jot down title . Reviews also can introduce me to a new writer . James Wood ’ s review of Erpenbeck ’ s novel is what sent me to read this unknown ( to me ) writer a well a his review of Walter Kempowski ’ s novel “ All for Nothing . ”
 What do you plan to read next ?
 Oh dear , there is so much to read ! Sometimes I “ feed ” book from my pile to my husband , Bill , a fast reader , because I ’ m a frustratingly slow reader and at least I feel I am reading them by osmosis .

 LANDFALL By Thomas Mallon
 Our current presidency is more like fiction than ever seemed possible — a postmodern black comedy with a crazed protagonist hellbent on blurring all line between fantasy and reality . Which is just one of the thing that make reading and judging a work of fiction about the last Republican president , George W. Bush , somewhat complicated .
 “ Landfall ” is Thomas Mallon ’ s 10th novel . Most of the others are also set in Washington around Republican president , all the way back to Abraham Lincoln . Yet even though the presidency in this book ended only a decade ago , it past is a foreign country nonetheless . A government run by establishment Republicans , many of them decent and idealistic ? How quaint .
 The author is an establishment Republican . He ghostwrote Dan Quayle ’ s memoir and served a deputy chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities under Bush . ( Disclosure : The N.E.H . ha provided funding to the public radio show I host . ) In a 2016 article he called his party ’ s imminent convention “ a political Jonestown. ” Of course , the cyanide in Donald Trump ’ s Kool-Aid turned out to be a slow-acting kind , and in fact he ’ s done Mallon a favor , making this an optimal moment to publish a sympathetic novel concerning a bad-but-not-that-bad Republican president .
 Previous fiction about Washington politics mostly avoided using real name of the living people they fictionalized , from Henry Adams ’ s “ Democracy ” through Allen Drury ’ s “ Advise and Consent. ” Even in Philip Roth ’ s satirical fantasy “ Our Gang , ” Nixon and the other character had fictional name , a did the Clintons et al . in Joe Klein ’ s “ Primary Colors. ” But by 2008 it seemed almost quaint when Curtis Sittenfeld altered Laura and George Bush ’ s name and background in her excellent novel “ American Wife. ” Oliver Stone ’ s biopic “ W. ” and Will Ferrell ’ s Bush play , “ You ’ re Welcome America , ” appeared around that time , and since then naming name ha become the Washington-fiction norm , a in movie like “ Vice. ” So , no surprise , Mallon ’ s three most recent novel — “ Watergate ” ; “ Finale , ” about Reagan ; and now “ Landfall ” — are jam-packed with “ real ” people , a hundred apiece .
 That extreme celebritude aside , however , Mallon writes old-school Washington fiction in the Ward Just tradition , neither Gore Vidalian cynicism nor , despite it funny moment — at a Christopher Hitchens party , “ John Edwards and Donatella Versace silently marveled at each other ’ s appearance ” — Chris Buckleyesque comedy .
 As teenager in 1978 , the two main character , Ross and Allison , meet at a W.-for-Congress campaign event in Lubbock — at which Ross encounter Bush too , and “ vaguely realized that … he wa a little in love with both of them. ” Ross and Allie date a bit but that ’ s that . Ross go from Lubbock to Harvard for a Ph.D. , becomes a professor , whereafter “ being a registered Republican academic made him enough of a rara avis ” to get hired a a federal humanity bureaucrat in Washington ( in other word , much like Mallon ) . Which enables Ross and Allie to re-meet cute after 27 year apart , just when Ross ’ s marriage to “ his Bush-hating wife ” is unraveling . Allie , a civilian lawyer for the Army , D.C.-based but dispatched frequently to Afghanistan and Iraq , never married . Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld take a shine to her uppity skepticism of the Iraq war . He assigns her to the National Security Council staff , hoping she ’ ll be a more forceful “ office wife ” to the president than Condoleezza Rice , the new secretary of state . Bush take even more of a shine to Allie .
 “ Landfall ” is a romance — a romance in which the president repeatedly intercedes , rom-com fashion — set against the machination concerning the administration ’ s defining failure in Iraq . There ’ s also quite a bit about it other defining failure , Hurricane Katrina , and a good , MacGuffinish Bush family subplot that Ross uncovers .
 Mallon ’ s portrayal of most of his well-known main character are flattering . But he ’ s also entertainingly bitchy . He nail John Kerry at Bush ’ s second inaugural — “ the disappointed , more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger look … that pained expression of his , sort of a sigh that always meant to say it ’ s more complicated than that. ” Barbara Bush is consistently mean , and not just about Jeb , the “ son she admired more and loved less. ” Laura never liked Karl Rove , and call John Irving “ a modern , mediocre Dickens. ” Nancy Reagan mus that Princess Diana wa dumb , John Travolta gay ; since she ’ s old enough that her “ daughter ha had her first face lift ” she should relax about life . Elizabeth Dole ’ s cosmetic surgery is “ shockingly bad , ” and her fellow-former-senator husband Bob “ truly couldn ’ t stand ” the elder George Bush and disliked his son “ even more . ”
 Mallon turn a few real people into piñatas he hit repeatedly , and not just famous one like Edwards and Henry Kissinger . The longtime Bush lieutenant Karen Hughes asks Condi Rice to pull string to get her son into Stanford . ( Rice wa actually Stanford ’ s provost , and Hughes ’ s son , named in the novel , actually went there . ) The Bush speechwriter Michael Gerson get multiple whack , including a joke about his real-life heart attack . I anticipated fun when a certain White House staff secretary appears early on , complete with a presidential nickname , “ K-Man ” — but , unlike a Chekhovian first-act pistol , Brett Kavanaugh never speaks or return .
 Rice is the most compelling character . Allie pity “ poor Condi , who seemed to have spent a lifetime offering graciousness a a kind of microwaved substitute for actual warmth. ” Barbara Bush reckons Rice “ wanted her real personality to break through ; she wa merely afraid of it — a opposed to Hillary … who despised her own real self. ” But Rice ha an authentic center , know that if she ran for office “ every compromise and stifling and self-suppression to be performed would … devour her with shame . ”
 At an Army base in Germany , preparing to address the troop outdoors , she unbuttons her coat so it will blow open and “ reveal a pair of knee-high boot tightly encasing two leg whose several inch of exposed thigh had been made shapely by uncountable hour on the elliptical . … Our Miss Brooks morphing into Lucy Lawless . … Dominatrix ? Who , me ? ” Three hundred page later , she ’ s in bed with the named , real Canadian foreign minister , a man 11 year her junior . “ Condi admired the forearm flexor of Canada ’ s Sexiest Male M.P. , ” and later proudly think “ I got laid , ” but also recognizes that their “ lovemaking resembled the U.S.-Canadian relationship … affectionate ; not especially dramatic ; and unlikely to evolve . ”
 As for Bush , I ’ m willing to buy that he really is kind , particularly to the woman in his life ; emotional about the wounded and displaced ; “ sickened ” by corruption “ more than any dovishness ” ; and realized after being re-elected “ how much he already wanted the whole thing to be over. ” And he might have the dark , funny thought that “ if the plane aiming for the Capitol dome on September 11 had actually hit it , he could imagine his vice president muttering ‘ No loss ’ through that sly slit of a mouth . ”
 But the W. of “ Landfall ” is unbelievably wonderful . He make charming fun of his reputation for ignorance — and then disproves it again and again . He ’ s fluent geopolitically , historically , philosophically . He know minutia , like the Iraqi village where Saddam ’ s regime executed over 140 people in 1982 , and he ’ s smart about the bigger picture , understanding that his war to incite regional democratization “ wa , he ’ d come to realize , his own domino theory , a reversal of the L.B.J . version. ” When Rumsfeld and Rice have a spat , he angrily asks : “ What would you call that ? A ‘ dialectic ’ ? ” His born-again Christianity , he figure , give him “ more in common with , and more insight into , the most radical Muslim who read his Quran than the unbeliever who never opened his Bible. ” And Mallon ’ s Bush is this much of a brainiac mensch : He ’ s trying to finagle a happy ending for Allie and Ross because he ’ d failed in Iraq and New Orleans , and thus “ felt required to amalgamate … the miniature and the giant . If he could help to solve their problem , writ small in the ink of a double catastrophe , maybe that could lead him toward a solution for the catastrophe themselves . ”
 His flaw are barely flaw . Dole rag on him for “ always choking up ” and Kissinger , likewise , for possibly being “ the sincerest man I ’ ve ever met. ” In this book his biggest problem , which Mallon diagnosis well , is a fundamental uneasiness , the lack of an even keel . Young Laura worry “ how long it would be before the quick , constant movement between overindulgence and athletic self-punishment broke the spring of her husband ’ s metronome. ” When Allie first beholds him , she remark on the fake good humor — “ He ’ s actually pissed off . I can see it in his eye ” — and three decade later still see the bipolarity : “ Half the time he wa without self-confidence ; the other half he spilled an excess of it. ” But this is such a mature and self-aware Bush that he know he “ had to fight it , the sudden shift from merriment to irritability , from runner ’ s high to cramp , the flight and crash he experienced a dozen time an hour. ” He wonder at one point if he is “ getting a paranoid a Nixon , ” and then decides that maybe President Ford “ wa the only normal guy to have occupied the place , ” including himself and his father .
 I wa surprised how little space such a thoughtful writer devotes in this long novel to the awful particular of it central catastrophe . He ’ s too easy on everyone . The action start nearly two year into the war , well after the administration made it big , terrible decision . The profound bungling and cynicism and deception behind those decision is elided , practically ignored , eclipsed by Bush ’ s present-moment sincerity and idealism . Dick Cheney is generally absent , a are any real discussion of waterboarding or rendition or Guantánamo . Rice ’ s predecessor , Colin Powell , who warned the president in 2002 that if we broke Iraq we ’ d own it , is recalled a a self-righteous as . The war year Mallon ha chosen to focus on , 2005 and 2006 , perfectly stack the moral deck in Bush ’ s favor — after breaking Iraq but before committing to trying to put it back together . In fact , the military “ surge ” that started in 2007 reduced the chaos the United States had unleashed . The one main character in the war zone is likable , lovable Allison , whose work doesn ’ t involve killing or torturing , and the Iraqi ( and Afghan ) character we meet still welcome the Americans a liberator , year into the war .
 Ross ’ s government job also consists of doing nice thing . The most Republican opinion he express isn ’ t very right-wing — annoyance at “ P.C . colleague in his department … with their theory-ridden view of American history a a sort of ongoing atrocity. ” In fact , he ’ s a deep-state RINO , finding the new bureaucratic term “ homeland … a trifle Third Reich-ish , ” and arguing against funding a hagiography of the conservative pundit Norman Podhoretz : “ Let ’ s not reject their junk just so we can start pushing our junk . ”
 The only contentious domestic policy topic addressed at any length is the ban on federal funding of stem cell research , which Mallon present a Bush ’ s proudest achievement but also ha Nancy Reagan eloquently deride . Otherwise , no contemptible belief or behavior are imputed to anybody . Even grading on a curve with Trump and his administration at one end , that seems strange .
 Some of the dialogue is reminiscent of the strenuously extra-witty repartee in Aaron Sorkin script . As when a German lawyer , flirting with Allie in Baghdad , proposes a “ coition of the willing. ” Or when Ross press her to accompany him on a business trip , and to his “ carpe diem ” she reply , “ You mean carpe your per diem. ” Or — come on ! — a Bush read through a proposed Iraqi constitution with his national security adviser , “ Laura softly sang : ‘ Sharia , I ’ ve just met a law named Sharia . … ’ ”
 But still , “ Landfall ” is smart and knowing and absorbing . It is to novel a good studio movie are to movie — extremely well made , satisfying if you have a taste for the genre , occasionally excellent . The prose is a pleasure . For better or worse , I can ’ t imagine a more positive portrayal of George W. Bush in a novel of this quality . And it unconventionality in that sense make it more interesting than if it take were standard leftish bien-pensant . Fiction is supposed to provide glimpse inside people different from u . As a one-of-a-kind artifact of pre-2016 Late Republicanism , “ Landfall ” is fascinating .
 Mallon ’ s novel have traced a pattern in their time travel : He set the first in the recent past ( 15 year before publication ) , moved back in history until reaching the 1860s , then reversed course and gradually set them closer and closer to the present . So here ’ s what I ’ m thinking : His next Washington novel will be set in an even more recent past , and won ’ t be bittersweet and fond but bitter and appalled and vicious , because it main real-life character will be the current Republican president .
 Kurt Andersen is the author , most recently , of “ Fantasyland ” and the co-author , with Alec Baldwin , of “ You Can ’ t Spell America Without Me : The Really Tremendous Inside Story of My Fantastic First Year a President Donald J. Trump . ”

 As tattooed rocker , tech bros and Instagram influencers pile into the tweedy world of watch collecting , price for sought-after classic from brand like Rolex , Omega and Patek Philippe are shooting up . In some case , they have doubled in just a couple of year .
 These next-generation collector see old timepiece not just a a subtly stylish way to dress up a T-shirt and jean , but also a a hot new asset in their investment portfolio . In a market where stock , bond and real estate seem at an unsteady peak , do vintage watch present a Bitcoin-in-2017-like growth opportunity ? Or are they in a Bitcoin-in-2017-like bubble ?
 Time — elegantly monitored — will tell .
 Even though his investment in watch ha doubled in value in just 18 month , Peter Goodwin , a private investor in Charlottesville , Va. , who also collect watch , said he is concerned about frothiness in the vintage market .
 “ It ’ s much like momentum investing in stock , ” he said . “ People see the rise in Facebook share , they see Mark Zuckerberg , and they want to ride it up . It is the same with the trendy watch we read about in the auction — the Paul Newman Rolex , the Omega Speedmasters , some Submariners . You see them rising and you want to jump on . ”
 “ The question , ” Mr. Goodwin said , “ is when doe it stop ? ”
 That ’ s a risk that newcomer watch geek like Shahien Hendizadeh , a recent business school graduate in Los Angeles , are willing to take .
 “ Buying a good vintage Rolex is just like purchasing stock in a company like Nestlé or Google , ” Mr. Hendizadeh , 25 , said . “ It is the quintessential blue chip . ”
 After taking a face-plant on a long-shot $ 2,000 investment in American Apparel stock , just month before the company declared bankruptcy , he bought a 1982 Rolex Submariner for $ 13,000 . It ha appreciated perhaps $ 10,000 in two year , he said .
 And in the event of an economic downturn , fine watch may turn out to represent a safe-haven asset , like metal or gem , for investor looking to diversify their portfolio . Or they may just be another of-the-moment asset that 1 percenters , flush with cash , have inflated to unsustainable proportion .
 Watch collector hide in plain sight . John Mayer ’ s watch collection is nearly a famous a his guitar work . His bank vault contains a vast array of collectible , including sapphire-encrusted gold Rolexes and Luftwaffe watch from World War II , that he ha said is valued in the “ ten of million . ”
 Silicon Valley heavyweight like Kevin Rose , the Digg founder , and Matt Jacobson , Facebook ’ s employee No . 8 , have museum-worthy Rolexes and Patek Philippes , helping to establish a head-turning timepiece a a tech-world style flourish to rival the hoodie .
 Ellen DeGeneres wore a holy-grail Paul Newman-model Rolex Daytona from the 1960s , now worth perhaps $ 250,000 , while bantering with Jerry Seinfeld in an episode of “ Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee ” last year . ( Adam Levine and Ed Sheeran have been spotted wearing Paul Newmans a well . One also made a cameo on the wrist of Pierre Png ’ s character in “ Crazy Rich Asians . ” )
 In professional sport , high-end timepiece have long seemed a indispensable a a shoe contract for star with seven- and eight-figure income . Top athlete including Rafael Nadal , Dwyane Wade and LeBron James have served a celebrity ambassador for brand like Richard Mille , Hublot and Audemars Piguet .
 Star player who have been traded have been known to trade a Rolex to a player on their new team to secure their old jersey number . And in recent year , several have morphed into certifiable watch snob . Howie Kendrick of the Washington Nationals , for example , count understated heirloom , like a 1959 LeCoultre Deep Sea Alarm and a 1960s Breitling Superocean , a key element of his off-field uniform .
 If you ’ re still 1 percent-ish but would prefer to dabble , there ’ s good news . The Watch Fund , run by Dominic Khoo , a shareholder and watch specialist with the auction company Antiquorum , offer people a chance to invest in rare and limited-edition watch at price that can be 50 percent or more below retail . Those who have bought in have seen at least double-digit return since the fund ’ s inception six year ago , Mr. Khoo said .
 Star power and fund like Mr. Khoo ’ s add credence to the idea that fine watch are a soybean or a copper , another investable commodity . But doe that make them a good investment ?
 What even make a watch valuable ? Consider the bezel insert from a 1957 Rolex Submariner . A bezel insert is the featherweight aluminum disk with number on it that surround the dial of a diver ’ s watch .
 On Submariners made in the third quarter of 1957 , the bezel insert wa made with an unusual red triangle at 12 o ’ clock and slightly different typography on the numeral . Because it is rare , that insert is so sought after by collector that it can fetch more than $ 30,000 these day , said Eric Wind , a dealer of fine vintage watch in Florida , up from maybe $ 10,000 just a few year ago .
 None of this necessarily make sense . It ’ s not like a vintage watch is better than a new one . In fact , it ’ s worse in almost every way .
 A new Rolex Submariner , for example , is a modern update of a decades-old classic that seems to be every budding watch geek ’ s first serious timepiece . The new Sub is a marvel of mechanical engineering , with a high-tech ceramic bezel that is virtually guaranteed not to fade , a solid-steel bracelet a rugged a a tank tread , and a crystal made of sapphire that is all but scratch-proof . It ’ s a watch that feel indestructible enough for a pleasure dive in the Mariana Trench .
 No one would ever say that about it predecessor , those midcentury Submariners made famous by Sean Connery ’ s James Bond , which are shooting up in value despite the fact that they feature an acrylic ( that is , plastic ) crystal prone to scratch and crack , a hollow-steel bracelet that eventually might stretch like an accordion , and a painted dial that could fade from the original black to an espresso brown ( known to collector a a “ tropical ” dial ) .
 Which is , naturally , why old watch are considered cool : They have patina , provenance , soul . And for a generation of men ( and yes , vintage watch seem to be an obsession largely for men , with apology to Ellen ) who value the analog-chic of antique mechanical watch , just like vinyl record and selvage jean , that is key .
 “ Vintage watch should show off their age , ” said Nelson Murray , a 31-year-old photographer and budding collector in San Francisco . Vintage sport watch , like his Rolex GMT-Master , a classic pilot ’ s watch from 1980 , “ evoke a sense of adventure and a kind of dare to add more ding and scratch to them a evidence of a life lived . ”
 Prices for some Rolex GMT-Master model — in the proper condition , with original part — have spiked to perhaps $ 16,000 , up from $ 8,000 just two or three year ago , said Paul Altieri of Bob ’ s Watches , a prominent retailer in Newport Beach , Calif. ( It routinely show off sumptuous wrist shot of old classic for it Instagram follower . )
 A few year ago , Matt Hranek , a watch-loving photographer who recently founded a men ’ s style magazine called Wm Brown , flipped a 1960s Omega Speedmaster ( the same model worn by the astronaut Ed White on the first American spacewalk ) for five time what he paid for it , he said . That score helped him persuade his wife that a portfolio of vintage watch could serve a an alternate 401 ( k ) for the family .
 “ I convinced her — I think — that it wa much more practical to invest regularly in watch that I know about rather than the stock market that I know absolutely nothing about , ” Mr. Hranek , 51 , said .
 Benjamin Clymer , the founder of the watch site Hodinkee , which ha evolved from a one-man watch blog to a market-moving editorial and e-commerce site selling new and vintage watch , ha been practicing a form of horological arbitrage with his collection for year .
 In 2012 , for example , he bought a Patek Philippe Nautilus , a triumph of 1970s mod design that conjures image of Concorde flight and fondue party , for $ 18,000 . That watch is worth at least $ 75,000 today , Mr. Clymer , 36 , said . That ’ s not his only home run a a watch investor .
 “ I have a distinct memory of a friend who is now one of the great vintage dealer in the world calling me crazy for spending $ 30,000 for an early 1950s Omega Speedmaster , ” he said . “ The same watch today would be well north of $ 100,000 . ”
 With wrist shot flourishing on Instagram and watch site like Hodinkee , Worn & Wound and Monochrome spreading arcane watch knowledge to the mass , collector demand is spreading beyond behemoth brand like Rolex and Omega to lesser-known maker like Universal Genève .
 One particularly coveted version of that venerable Swiss maker ’ s Compax chronograph famously graced the wrist of Nina Rindt , the fashionable wife of the 1970s Formula One racer Jochen Rindt . It began trading a high a $ 45,000 recently , up from maybe $ 2,800 in 2011 , although the market ha cooled of late , Mr. Wind said ; the same model might trade for $ 20,000 to $ 30,000 , he added .
 But no watch ha exploded in value like the Paul Newman Daytona . It is an auto racer ’ s chronograph that once wa considered something of an afterthought in the watch world . Joanne Woodward accidentally made it iconic when she bought one for Mr. Newman , her gear-head husband , in the late 1960s for about $ 250 .
 Whether she noticed it or not , the specific model she selected for Mr. Newman , who could often be found circling the track when he wa not making movie , wa rare , featuring distinctive Art Deco-inflected numeral on it three sub-dials denoting second , minute and hour . This only appeared on perhaps one in 20 Daytonas from the late 1960s and early 1970s .
 Over the year , Mr. Newman ’ s stature a a style icon grew , and so did the mythology — and value — of the Rolex he flashed on magazine cover . In a 2014 post , Hodinkee scoured old auction catalog featuring Paul Newman sale and found estimate a low a $ 9,257 in 1992 , and a low ( yes ) a $ 66,000 in 2008 .
 Those were the day . After Paul Newman ’ s own Paul Newman attracted worldwide headline by selling at auction for $ 17.8 million after a mere 12 minute of bidding in 2017 , every Paul Newman suddenly seems to be trading like a Picasso .
 A coveted version known a an Oyster Mk 1 “ panda ” went for more than $ 750,000 at a Phillips auction in Geneva this past spring , a figure that shocked Mr. Clymer , who once owned that very watch .
 “ The Oysters are something really special , and go well beyond ticking the box for a rich guy to prove he ’ s cool , ” Mr. Clymer said . “ I bought this watch in the two , sold it in the three , and I thought I wa the smartest man in the room . How could a steel Daytona break $ 400,000 ? ”
 Not every old watch ha value . Anyone who scoop up a cheap boxful of half-working Bulovas from the 1950s at a flea market is likely to end up with a cheap boxful of half-working Bulovas from the 1950s .
 Vintage watch collecting can prove a minefield for newbie collector . Even with blue-chip model , seemingly imperceptible difference can add or detract thousand of dollar in value . A Rolex Submariner from the 1960s with an original bezel insert featuring a so-called long 5 is worth thousand more than one with a replacement insert with a shorter , more contemporary 5 .
 Buyers need to figure out if a watch ha been polished over the year — actually considered a bad thing , since polishing can wear down the crisp edge of it case , Mr. Wind said . And they need to watch out for unscrupulous dealer peddling so-called Frankenwatches , which contain non-original part that can torpedo the value .
 Besides , watch collecting can be similar to art collecting in that dealer tend to reserve the most coveted piece for insider and heavyweight collector , rarely making them available to the general public .
 And then there are the fickle market taste that any sort of collector must try to anticipate . Right now , the arrow is pointing up on best-of-breed sport watch with steel bracelet , like the Nautilus , the Submariner and GMT , the early Speedmasters , the Audemars Piguet Royal Oak and certain vintage Tudors and Heuers , Mr. Clymer said .
 There ’ s no telling how the demand for five- and six-figure timepiece will hold up should , say , a credit implosion in China , or a splintering of the eurozone , produce a sequel to the 2008 financial crisis , or should Democratic Socialists sweep to power in Washington on promise of a 70 percent tax rate on the target demographic for museum-worthy watch .
 Already , some sure thing , like certain Daytonas , are looking like slightly le than a sure thing .
 “ The market for Daytona just got a little silly for awhile , ” Mr. Clymer said . “ We saw reference worth $ 20,000 , $ 25,000 in 2011 to 2015 all of a sudden worth $ 50,000 , then all of a sudden worth $ 80,000 . And now those same reference are worth $ 65,000 . That ’ s still significantly higher than they were , but they ’ ve come down from the stratosphere . ”
 During the bear market of 2008 to 2009 , too , price for some high-flying vintage model , including Paul Newmans , dipped by 30 to 40 percent , said Matthew Bain , a dealer of fine watch in Miami Beach . But , like stock , they bounced back to new high .
 The rebound may seem intoxicating . But people who think of their watch collection a an alternative to an E-Trade account may be in for a rude surprise when they discover that watch often come with sizable dealer fee , not to mention substantial outlay for insurance , secure storage and other hidden cost , Mr. Khoo said .
 “ Investors are not collector , and collector are not investor , ” Mr. Khoo said . His Watch Fund ha a database of “ more than 9,000 watch collector worldwide , ” he said , and “ I have never met someone who bought hundred of watch that he liked , and sold 100 percent of them for a net absolute gain . ”
 In other word , newcomer to the watch world may want to heed the warning attached to brokerage advertisement on television : Past performance is no guarantee of future result .
 Or , they may just want to buy whatever look cool and leave it at that .

 A writer never knew her family ’ s house on St. Thomas , in the U.S. Virgin Islands , but discovering it , and her history , became an obsession .
 By Jessica Francis Kane
 Here is everything I knew about Mafolie before I went to the Caribbean island of St. Thomas in January : It wa one of the original hilltop estate , given to my grandparent by my great-grandfather a a wedding present in 1936 . The view , of Magens Bay to the north and Charlotte Amalie harbor to the south , were supposedly among the most-acclaimed in the Caribbean .
 When my father wa a child , the estate wa 42 acre , but when his parent divorced , he returned to the mainland with his mother and didn ’ t go back , or see his father , for 25 year . When he did return , in July 1973 , he had a Ph.D. , a wife and a baby daughter , and the estate had been subdivided . My grandfather had managed to keep the original house , the Great House and two acre . We went back the following summer , when I wa 3 , and that is the last time any of u saw Mafolie .
 My father is a university professor , a scientist skeptical of what he call my “ humanist love of place. ” And yet he wa the one who kept a framed pair of map of St. Thomas , one of the biggest of the U.S. Virgin Islands , on the wall behind his dining room chair all the year I wa growing up . He is the one who said the view from Mafolie had been described a the “ eighth wonder of the world , ” and told me about my grandfather playing horseshoe in the evening , his cocktail in a glass the shape of a bud vase so it could be slipped into his shirt pocket . I share my father ’ s deep love of his second landscape , the Connecticut River valley , but this first , tropical place wa a mystery to me .
 The name Mafolie is from the French and mean “ my madness , my obsession . ”
 What is a daughter who grows up to be a writer to do but go and see for herself ?
 I stayed at the Mafolie Hotel which wa built precipitously into the hillside below the original 42-acre estate when my father wa little . It ’ s a compact place , more vertical than horizontal , with room and terrace across five level , all beautifully landscaped , and a view of Charlotte Amalie harbor a magnificent a the one from the private house above it . The hotel came through the hurricane of 2017 , Irma and Maria , relatively intact , and for month afterward housed relief worker and member of the Army Corps of Engineers . It ha now fully reopened to tourist .
 The first thing I did after checking in wa spread the map of St. Thomas my father had given me on the bed , smoothing out the wrinkle from the suitcase , a if preparing for the final leg of a treasure hunt . In a way I wa .
 I wa painfully aware of how little I knew about my grandfather , Frederick C. Dixon . A Quaker from Pennsylvania , he had settled on St. Thomas in 1930 after a few year working aboard a ship . He became a teacher , the principal of St. Thomas High School , and then director of education in short order . He wa white , on an island where three-quarters of the population is black . Given the colonial history of the island , I wa uncomfortable not knowing what his view on race had been .
 Also , the Mafolie Great House wa gone . When my grandfather died in 1989 , the Great House and remaining two acre became the property of his second wife . When she died in 1995 , she left the property to her daughter from a previous marriage , and no one in my family knew what had become of it . I had only recently discovered that in 1977 my grandfather applied to have the house listed on the National Register of Historic Places , an application that wa approved in 1978 . The listing describes Mafolie a once being part of Catherineberg , a sugar plantation . It wa also listed on the Virgin Islands Inventory of Historic Places .
 But we knew the Great House wa gone because when it wa leveled , sometime in the early 1990s , a neighbor gathered some thing from the rubble and sent them to my father . Among the item : a leather address book , my grandfather ’ s Humane Society of St. Thomas membership card , some old photograph and an empty black wallet .
 Whatever stood there now , I wanted to see it .
 At the Mafolie Hotel , the friendliness of the staff wa infectious . First name were shared and remembered immediately and I very quickly felt a if I ’ d known everyone — staff and other guest — much longer than I had . This charming warmth and the beautiful view make the hotel the kind of place where even local come to have a drink at the bar .
 The first night I met two of them , Lucy Serge and Diane Holmberg . “ Oh , the island always brings you back , ” they said when I told them why I wa there . I thought it wa a quaint idea . Lucy told me she would contact a friend of hers who might be able to help me with my research . That would be great , I said , if it worked out . But I really thought it wouldn ’ t .
 I spent the next morning exploring Charlotte Amalie . Everyone I talked to mentioned how good it wa that the island wa green again and that tourism wa returning — four to five cruise ship in the harbor every day — but if you looked carefully the sign of devastation weren ’ t hard to see . Mangled gate and broken wall and steel-reinforced column holding up nothing . There were pile of debris here and there , and many tree had the dead branch of other tree wedged into them , blown there by the hurricane-force wind .

 That afternoon Lucy ’ s friend , Juliette Creque Scobie , called me . Her father ’ s family ’ s history on the island went back hundred of year and her mother had owned an old house in Misgunst , the estate right next to Mafolie . Juliette offered to help me find my grandfather ’ s property . At one time she ’ d worked for the Chamber of Commerce and had shown journalist and others around the island . But this wa something she hadn ’ t done in more than 30 year . “ This is interesting to me , ” she said . “ The island is obviously in your blood . ”
 She picked me up that evening and we drove up the road from the hotel . At the top of the hill on the right , there are two gate for Estate Mafolie , north and south . I didn ’ t know which property had been the site of the Great House , so we were at a loss and we were fast losing the light . We tried the Lower Road through the south gate first , but the view didn ’ t align with the photograph I had , a few from my father ’ s childhood in the 1940s and some from our visit in the 1970s .
 We drove back to the entrance and took the Upper Road through the north gate . The vegetation wa lush and the house stood back from the road , sometimes behind their own gate , so it wa not an easy neighborhood to navigate . We hadn ’ t gone very far when I saw a house on the left in ill-repair and so overgrown it seemed like it could have been abandoned . It looked a little bit like the house in my photo and for a moment I wondered if Mafolie hadn ’ t been knocked down after all .
 Juliette parked and we went up to the gate , which wa not very big or grand . It wa also unlocked . Determined to solve the mystery , I rather uncharacteristically pushed it open and stepped onto the property . I wa walking around the front of the house when Juliette called , “ Inside ! Inside ! ” which is , I learned after my heart stopped racing , a typical way of approaching a house on the island . A man called , “ Who is it ? ” from an open window , and I tried to explain why I wa trespassing .
 “ I ’ ll be right out , ” the voice said , and a few minute later , Bill Demetree came outside and asked me to repeat my grandfather ’ s name .
 “ I knew him , ” Bill said . “ It wa a travesty when they knocked the Great House down. ” He said travesty with great force .
 I asked him if he could show me where it had been and Bill walked u slowly , on somewhat unsteady leg , to the edge of his property . He pointed to a gate slightly up the road and off a spur to the right . “ That ’ s number 8 , ” he said . “ Where your grandfather lived . But if you look through it now you won ’ t recognize anything . ”
 I ran up there while Bill and Juliette chatted about hurricane-related insurance problem . This gate wa much bigger than Bill ’ s , with proper stone column and wrought iron , and lot of sign announcing that the area wa under 24-hour surveillance . It wa dusk now , but I snapped a few picture anyway . If they were dark and mysterious , it seemed appropriate .
 With the sound of a tropical night all around , Bill told u that the Great House wa knocked down soon after my grandfather died , but year passed before two building housing several multimillion dollar condo were built on the site .
 “ How ? ” I asked .
 Bill shook his head . He said at least the developer had left some of the old tree .
 The next afternoon , Juliette drove me to Magens Bay , where my young parent had taken me swimming a a toddler and afterward we went to a restaurant called Hook , Line and Sinker for lunch . We were waiting for our food when suddenly Juliette stood up to hug two woman who ’ d come in . One wa Lillia King , the daughter of Cyril E. King , the second elected governor of the island for whom the airport is named . The other wa Cleone Creque , Juliette ’ s half sister who had served a a senator in the territorial legislature of the Virgin Islands . They marveled at the coincidence of bumping into each other just now and Juliette explained why I ’ d come to St. Thomas .
 Cleone said , “ Frederick C. Dixon ? ”
 “ Yes , ” I said , very surprised .
 “ The commissioner of school ? ”
 “ Yes . ”
 “ What did the C stand for ? I always wondered . ”
 “ Charles , ” I said .
 “ Oh , that ’ s pretty , ” she said .
 Cleone and Lillia sat down next to u for lunch and here are some of the thing Cleone said about my grandfather :
 “ He wa very popular . He wa one of u , very quickly . ”
 “ He proposed a number of improvement to the educational system . ”
 “ He wa a breath of fresh air . He cared about the black child . ”
 “ He is not forgotten . ”
 And then she looked at Juliette and said that their father and my grandfather had been good friend . While my grandfather wa trying to improve the public school ( he helped establish the first teacher institute on the island ) , their father wa responsible for giving the school bus contract to a nonwhite person for the first time .
 Juliette and I looked at each other and ordered another drink .
 “ This wa meant to be , ” she said .
 My last morning in St. Thomas , I woke up early . I knew so much more about my grandfather , but I wa still haunted by a dream I ’ d had of Mafolie the night I ’ d made my reservation for the trip . I wa sitting on bleacher over a beautiful turquoise bay when suddenly the seat rose up and became a roller coaster . I don ’ t like roller coaster and so closed my eye against the feeling . But with my eye closed I couldn ’ t see the landscape . In the dream I wa there but not there , unable to see what I ’ d come to see .
 My flight home wasn ’ t until the afternoon , and though I didn ’ t know how I wa going to get in , I decided that last morning that I had to try and see the place where the Great House had been , No . 8 Mafolie Estates .
 I walked up the road staying a close to the shrubbery a I could . You don ’ t see many walker on the hill road because they ’ re narrow and there are no sidewalk — I ’ d been warned against it — but I wa determined . When I came to the Estate Mafolie gate I punched in the code . I followed the Upper Road to the gate Bill had shown me and a I stood before it , I heard a hummingbird thrum past . I found it hovering near a red flower just inside the gate where it stayed a moment before flying on . In Connecticut , my grandmother and I had both loved hummingbird . This seemed like — a sign ? I sat down .
 When a BMW appeared at the top of the drive , the gate started to open . The driver lowered his window , and I explained what I wa doing there . He said I could look about the place , but the gate had closed behind his car , so he gestured at the foliage and said , “ Just go around . ”
 He drove off and while I wa trying to figure out what he meant , a woman came walking up the road . Her name wa Susannah , and she turned out to be the BMW driver ’ s housekeeper . She said I could follow her , and so I did , into the foliage around the pillar on the right side of the gate . We stepped over uneven rock and had to push back branch ; this wa her path to work . I told her there should be a proper path and she laughed . Susannah went inside one of the grand , two-story pale yellow building and I walked around the hilltop for a while . Then I sat down on the grass , my back to the building , my face to the Caribbean .
 Here is what I wrote in my notebook : “ I am on a terraced slope of lawn high above Charlotte Amalie harbor . There are old mahogany tree dotting the property that must have stood in my grandmother ’ s time . I ’ ve put my hand on them and said hello . A very old banyan tree stand on the north side , where the view is of Magens Bay , so that must have been there , too . The air smell of sun and jasmine . There is a constant wind , a little more insistent than a breeze . You hear it in the mahogany leaf . Every now and then a seaplane take off over the harbor , sounding exactly a Dad described it . Every time one start up , I hear his impression in the hum . I must have known that sound , too , a a small child here . An occasional rooster and the echo of construction over the island are the only other sound . I found Mafolie . ”
 My grandmother spent all the year I knew her trying to grow tropical plant in Connecticut . My scientist father admitted the sound of a seaplane taking off is wonderful to him in a way he can ’ t quite explain . And island have always had a hold on me that my mainland childhood doesn ’ t quite account for . Mafolie .
 In the taxi to the airport I looked back at the ridge line above Charlotte Amalie one last time and realized I could tell where the Great House had been by the tree , the old and twisted mahogany left at the edge of the terracing .
 The island always brings you back .

 An earlier version of this article misidentified the size of St. Thomas . The island is one of the largest of the U.S. Virgin Islands ; it is not the largest . St. Croix hold that distinction .

 An unlikely art festival bloom in no man ’ s land , like Burning Man and Coachella before it . But this one is different ! Maybe .

 BOMBAY BEACH , Calif. — On a blustery Thursday in late March , Stefan Ashkenazy , a hotelier and art patron from Los Angeles , wa bucketing through town in his dusty Chevy Tahoe , pointing out the sight while overseeing the finishing touch on a medley of unusual construction project : a skeletal-looking Ferris wheel , which , he said , would soon be part of a voodoo-noir , circus-themed sculpture park ; a mock subdivision of derelict concrete brick and wood house flecked with graffiti and planted with stump of charred palm tree .
 Sunburned and with a movie star ’ s polish , Mr. Ashkenazy , 43 , wa sheathed in black , Johnny Cash style , from his cowboy hat to his jean , moving briskly to a backbeat of cellphone ping .
 He doubled back on the dirt-packed street to consult with his crew on how to secure LED light to show off the gilded letter of signage for a pretend subdivision called the Bombay Beach Estates , one of Mr. Ashkenazy ’ s many sight gag here .
 Despite the Burning Man-like shenanigan , this wa no wealthy bohemian boondoggle or corporate branding bonanza .
 For the last four year , Mr. Ashkenazy and others have been funding large-scale art installation for this tiny and very idiosyncratic desert community , unveiling them during a three-day free event archly known a the Bombay Beach Biennale that also feature classical opera , dance performance and a conference of philosophy professor . ( This year ’ s topic : postmodernism . )
 Some of the work is designed to confound , like Mr. Ashkenazy ’ s “ Drive In , ” which is filled with rusted-out car and look like a scene from the “ Twilight Zone ” episode in which everyone on earth ha vanished .
 Some is frankly gorgeous , in the tradition of earthwork artist like Walter De Maria or Robert Smithson . And Mr. Ashkenazy ’ s drive-in is a working theater : The projector is set in a shopping cart , and when he run a film , Mr. Ashkenazy drape the car seat in fabric and light wood fire in the engine bed .
 Mr. Ashkenazy ’ s primary collaborator are Lily Johnson White , 38 , a philanthropist and scion of the Johnson & Johnson family who is on the board of Creative Time , and Tao Ruspoli , 43 , a filmmaker , philosophy buff and son of an Italian playboy prince . At first glance they do seem like another gang of well-heeled Burners , a Burning Man participant are known , run amok in another desert town .
 Yet their l ’ art pour l ’ art effort are more akin to old-fashioned patronage than modern desert debauchery or ruin porn slumming . Who ’ s going to argue with buying lot in an area that ha been down on it luck for decade and turning them over to artist to make large-scale work for public viewing outside of the gallery system ?
 Certainly not Ariana Vafadari , a French-Iranian mezzo soprano who would perform during the biennale in a heartbreakingly beautiful dawn performance , and wa squashed into the back seat of Mr. Ashkenazy ’ s Chevy with the member of her band .
 “ Is it always this windy ? ” Ms. Vafadari asked . “ Tell me again what this project is about . ”
 Mr. Ashkenazy , husky voiced from week of desert work , said , “ From my side , the whole thing is managed between the twin pillar of lunacy and chaos . The hope is that the people in town will be proud of what is happening and want to show it off . ”
 Set on a gentle peninsula on the east coast of the Salton Sea , Bombay Beach had it heyday at midcentury , when resort community flourished along the shoreline of one of the more complicated ecosystem in Southern California .
 The largest lake in the state , the Salton Sea wa formed at the turn of the 20th century , when the Colorado River breached it levee and flooded what used to be known a the Salton Sink : a vast basin shaped long ago a the river meandered from within it delta , pushing sediment a far a the Gulf of California .
 From the beginning , the sea drew schemer and dreamer , like the sea captain who ran a dance hall and imported sea lion , a Kim Stringfellow , a Joshua Tree-based artist whose work investigates cultural landscape , note in “ Greetings From the Salton Sea : Folly and Intervention in the Southern California Landscape , 1905-2005 . ”
 The military directed all sort of operation around it . ( One of the region ’ s many contemporary tribe is the scrapper , who collect exploded ordnance and other metal treasure to sell . )
 What wa once a Marine base to the east is now Slab City , one of the largest vehicle squat in the country , named for the concrete foundation upon which it sprouted . Some say Bombay Beach came by it name because bomber leaving target practice over the Chocolate Mountains opened their bomb bay door over the spot .
 In the 1970s , a farm in the Coachella and Imperial Valleys grew more crop , increasing their agricultural runoff , the sea began to flood , swamping many of the resort ’ s little beach house , concrete brick cabin and R.V.s , and many resident abandoned their home .
 And then the sea began to shrink . In the last few decade , it ha grown increasingly inhospitable , with algae bloom and ever higher salinity killing off fish and bird in huge seasonal die-offs .
 Remediation effort have been slowed by competing interest . Should the focus be on constructing shallow pond to feed migrating bird and control dust , or would it make more sense just to abate the dust on the playa ? Should the state of California honor a commitment made in 2003 to restore the Salton Sea , despite moving water away from the area to thirsty coastal city ? Or should this artificial , long-festering sea be left alone to dry up entirely ?
 While politician have dithered , Bombay Beach ’ s atmospheric decay ha drawn filmmaker , novelist and other artist who marvel at the thriving community hidden inside seemingly derelict property . Granted , it is small , not even officially considered a town , but rather a C.D.P. , or census-designated place , with a population now at 341 , up 50 or so people since 2010 , and with a median age of 71 , according to the Census Reporter .
 Like many hardscrabble desert hamlet , it attracts those who by choice or necessity perch on society ’ s edge . It is also populated with house-proud weekender from San Diego , and senior who grew up camping here when they were child .
 As Cathy Ahinger , one such weekender , said , pulling up late one afternoon in her golf cart , “ What you see on the outside doesn ’ t always reflect what ’ s on the inside . ”
 In the 1980s , the photographer Richard Misrach made lyrical , large-scale print of Bombay Beach ’ s decaying trailer and submerged lamppost . Marisa Silver set her dark and lovely coming-of-age novel , “ The God of War ” ( 2008 ) , here . Anthony Bourdain once visited the Ski Inn , the place ’ s only restaurant , besides the American Legion Hall .
 Its filmography is disproportionately vast and includes “ Bombay Beach , ” a 2011 documentary by Alma Har ’ el , from Israel , that teeter on the edge of fantasy , capturing the precarious life of three Bombay Beach dweller ( a young boy whose parent have been in prison ; a teenager fleeing gang violence in Los Angeles ; and a cantankerous elderly man ) . More prosaically , it ha been a favored backdrop for zombie film and the video game Grand Theft Auto .
 The zombie movie did it no favor . Bombay Beach continues to represent the declining fortune of the Salton Sea , said Michael Cohen , a senior researcher at the Pacific Institute , a think tank devoted to sustainable water policy , but he is hopeful that California ’ s new administration will help save it .
 “ I ’ m cautiously and perhaps foolishly optimistic , ” Mr. Cohen said . “ I ’ ve been working on this for 20 year , and I keep thinking , ‘ This is the year something is going to happen. ’ But I ’ m sure this is the year something is going to happen . I ’ m pretty excited that people have reimagined Bombay Beach because it really change the narrative and hopefully all these narrative will come together and we ’ ll see some progress . ”
 It wa Ms. Stringfellow ’ s book that propelled Mr. Ruspoli here nearly 12 year ago . He noted others taking photo , shooting music video and fashion spread , and then leaving . Why wa there no mark of their work in Bombay Beach ? he wondered .
 He bought a lot with a double-wide for $ 20,000 and invited his friend , including Ms. White . The Bombay Beach Biennale began a a sort of joke , he said , because he liked the alliteration and the idea of spoofing the art world .
 “ We don ’ t pretend that we can raise the billion it will take to fix the Salton Sea , ” Mr. Ruspoli said . “ But one of the job of the artist is to show the world to people in a fresh light . I hope we ’ re going to do that in a way that ’ s not too sanctimonious or too on the nose . ”
 He knew that Mr. Ashkenazy , a friend since seventh grade with a flair for experiential art project , could help him pull it off . Mr. Ashkenazy ’ s girlfriend at the time , Arwen Byrd , a lanky filmmaker , now 31 , had been a Bombay Beach regular since college .
 “ Your first thought when you drive through the town from just a budgetary and logistical standpoint is that you have to make the obligatory post-apocalyptic zombie movie there , ” said Ms. Byrd , who ha already set one here and is working on another , which she described a a love letter to the place , with nobody dying . “ It ’ s easy to be dismissive of the town when you only look at it from the surface level of poverty . ”
 It ’ s easy , also , to be concerned that an infusion of hip and rich may spoil this strange sea . For decade , Joshua Tree , an hour and a half to the north , ha been welcoming artist who are drawn to it lunar landscape and libertarian mythos .
 Each spring , more than 100,000 people now attend Coachella , le than an hour away . Pioneertown , east of Palm Springs and built a a movie set in the 1940s , is now a weekend destination for Los Angeles hipster who have been renovating it miner ’ s cabin , building recording studio and lining up for mushroom toast at La Copine , a roadside restaurant .
 Even rough-hewed Slab City , 30 minute or so from Bombay Beach , ha lately been battling an influx of Instagrammers , fashion photographer and Airbnbs .
 Randy Polumbo , an artist who ha a house in Joshua Tree , led me up the vertigo-inducing ladder of his upside-down fuselage , which he planted on two lot at the biennale and which blossom into a bulbous cage from which you can see for mile . Gentrifying Bombay Beach doesn ’ t seem probable , he said a I peered through the cage , wind whipped and white knuckled . “ It ’ s just too hard a life . ”
 Even so , he continued , “ There are so many interesting people creating a sense of place and wonder out of not much , or something awful . It ’ s part of a longstanding tradition that made this whole thing bubble up . Originally people came here to have a kind of textbook waterfront leisure experience , and then it turned into something much richer , darker , weirder . ”
 The element take their toll . The artist Kenny Scharf wa back this year to tend to a house he had strung with large plastic child ’ s toy — car , pony , baby carriage .
 “ This house is an expression of our consumption , ” said Ms. White , who wa putting up Mr. Scharf in the double-wide trailer she had just bought at the edge of town . “ Artists have to be willing to brave the element here , and Kenny is a badass and just deal with it all . ”
 Mr. Scharf yelled for more toy , and Ms. White handed up a pink plastic shopping cart and some yellow rope . “ I ’ m totally at home here , ” Mr. Scharf said . “ Anything go and no one is watching . It ’ s like the East Village in the ’ 80 . ”
 Not exactly , Ms. White said : “ There are definitely people watching . We want to be good neighbor . We own home , and we sit on the community board . ”
 Mark Wrathall , a professor of philosophy at the University of Oxford , ha attended every biennale , part of the academic conference his friend Mr. Ruspoli ha programmed . “ When I first landed , it just seemed insane , ” Mr. Wrathall said . “ Quixotic in the literal sense . This ridiculously absurd effort to do something in an environment that ’ s so hostile to art . ”
 Now , he said , “ I look forward to this more than anything else I do in my academic life. ” On the Saturday afternoon of the festival , he gave a talk on postmodernism and the work of Hieronymous Bosch to a full ( if burned-out ) house at the Bombay Beach Estates .
 The Ski Inn , a cheery and sun-shot establishment named for the water-skiing that wa a long-ago Salton Sea pastime , wa also packed that day .
 Its wall and ceiling were shellacked with dollar bill , and the jukebox wa playing classic rock . Sonia Herbert , who bought the place from it retiring owner last June , came out from the kitchen wearing a Bombay Beach Biennale T-shirt and wiped her hand on her apron .
 Now 76 , she wa in her 30 when she moved to Bombay Beach in the early 1970s , the mother of five son fleeing an abusive husband . Her father had a trailer , and she felt reassuringly enveloped by the community . “ I wa a housewife and never worked before then , ” she recalled .
 Ms. Herbert cleaned house , and ran a sandwich truck and the fire department ( one truck and , this year , just one volunteer ) . She became a paramedic because there wa no ambulance service .
 She left in the 1980s , moving to Oregon , England ( her birthplace ) and then France , before returning 16 year ago , because , a she said , “ This place just draw you back . It ’ s like a vortex or something. ” She ha been buying property ever since and recently sold a lot or two to the biennale folk and their friend for art project . “ If it hadn ’ t been for art , I wouldn ’ t have done it , ” she said .
 Running the Ski Inn ha been hard , Ms. Herbert went on , “ because the employment pool is so small , ” and business is up , thanks to the biennale . That event , she added , ha been like winning the lottery for this town .
 “ I think it ’ s marvelous , ” she said . “ You see lot of young people with lot of energy and good spirit . It ’ s refreshing . A lot of the old people are bitter because they don ’ t like to see change , but they do everything they can to appease everyone ’ s concern . You could see little place being bought and cleaned up — this year it ’ s been like a wave . ”
 Mr. Ruspoli estimated the cost of the biennale a upward of $ 100,000 , shared among his collaborator and with gift from donor like the philanthropist Aileen Getty . But not all of the biennale ’ s work is funded by it organizer . Volunteers from hither and yon sign up to build the work and feed the participant .
 Some artist , like Mr. Polumbo , have made their own considerable investment here . Of course , real estate in this harsh environment can be cheap : $ 500 may get you a “ beachfront ” lot ; for $ 8,500 , you might pick up a trash-filled cement box , a Mr. Ashkenazy did , turning it over to the artist Greg Haberny to curate a a year-round museum .
 Danielle Aykroyd , the daughter of the actor Dan Aykroyd , is a singer who go by the name Vera Sola . Last year , she bought a lot with conjoined trailer , not really habitable , at a tax auction for $ 2,500 .
 Her first thought wa , she said , “ Oh , God . What have I done ? The last thing I need right now is to be responsible for this quite literal ruin. ” She shot her last album cover there and performed during the biennale in her new “ living room , ” which she had embellished with garland of flower and fairy light .
 Stephanie Giuffre , a disabled veteran and artist who had been living in Slab City , bought two lot in Bombay Beach for $ 10,000 ; the only structure were a garage and a shed . She ha planted the yard with fruit tree , grape , passion fruit and edible cactus , along with a vintage Cadillac hearse , a vintage Cadillac limousine and a vintage Corvette trailer .
 She had become frustrated by the looky-loos at Slab City , she said . “ It seemed like everyone wa filming and had a hidden mic . It wa becoming a side show , ” she said .
 Life at Bombay Beach is not a harsh a at the Slabs , a the place is known — there is water and electricity , after all — but it feel like the Slabs used to , she said , in term of community . “ There is that give and take of people keeping to themselves , and also being there for you , ” she said . “ And wow , there ’ s a lot of art ! ”
 Across the street , Rhonda and Mark Hagedorn were sitting on their porch after a day ’ s yard work . Their spacious lot is ringed by lush salt cedar . Full-time resident since 2016 , they had been coming a weekender for 15 year from San Diego County .
 “ We ’ re desert rat , ” said Mr. Hagedorn , explaining how they have four-wheel adventure at the Glamis Dunes , about an hour to the southeast .
 Ms. Hagedorn said , “ The artist are doing their part to clean thing up . It ’ s great here , if you can get past the ugly . ”

 How the journalist Gauri Lankesh became a casualty of India ’ s increasingly intolerant politics .
 Gauri Lankesh in 2015.CreditCreditEsha Lankesh

 By Rollo Romig
 Gauri Lankesh usually worked late on Tuesday night . The exuberantly leftist weekly newspaper she edited , Gauri Lankesh Patrike , went to press on Wednesdays , and she had to finalize the article . But on Tuesday , Sept. 5 , 2017 , she drove home early , around 7:45 p.m. ; she had an evening appointment with cable repairman to fix her TV .
 The last person she spoke to before leaving the office wa Satish , the paper ’ s I.T . manager . Money wa always tight because of her refusal to allow advertisement in the newspaper , which she felt wa necessary to shield it from the corruption and outside pressure that often compromise the Indian press . Gauri Lankesh Patrike ran on subscription and newsstand sale , supplemented by a book-publishing sideline . But the paper ’ s financial situation had become so dire that she had decided , for the first time , to run ad in a forthcoming special holiday issue . She asked Satish ( who go by a single name ) to start soliciting them the next day .
 At it peak , Gauri Lankesh Patrike ’ s circulation numbered only in the high four digit , and Lankesh mostly wrote in Kannada , a regional language understood by only 3.6 percent of Indians ( though in hyper-populous India , that is 48 million people , more than the total population of Spain ) . But her political activism and her lively social medium presence extended her reach far beyond the paper ’ s print run . At a time of intense vitriol against the press in India , she wa a fearless , sometimes reckless critic of the right-wing , Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party , or B.J.P. , which ha held power in India since 2014 . Her paper wa a tabloid in every sense , gleefully sensational and indifferent to decorum . But the vehemence and humor of her polemic in defense of pluralism and minority right had made her a beloved figure to an increasingly embattled opposition .
 She wa more vulnerable than she sounded on the page . She reminded one friend of a sparrow : her head topped with a feathery whorl of short gray hair , bursting with noisy argument but fundamentally gentle . At 55 she wa five foot and a half inch tall — she always insisted on the half inch , her ex-husband said — and skinny , possibly because of her heavy smoking and her tendency to work through mealtime .
 She lived alone in an unusually quiet pocket of Bangalore , the capital city of the south Indian state of Karnataka . Her lone concession to friend and family concerned about her safety wa a few closed-circuit TV camera she installed half a year earlier — camera that captured some of what happened on the night of Sept. 5 .
 Just after 8 p.m. she parked her car , a compact white Toyota , at an indifferent angle , then jumped out to open the gate . From the camera footage , it appeared that she hadn ’ t noticed the motorcycle with two rider that had followed her home . The moment she got her gate open , the motorcycle ’ s passenger rushed up and shot her with a crude pistol . Two bullet hit her in the abdomen , one passing through her liver .
 Lankesh turned to run , and the third shot missed her and struck a wall . A fourth bullet hit her in the back , passing through a lung and grazing her heart before exiting through the left cup of her bra . The whole encounter lasted about five second . Within a minute , the cable repairman pulled up and found her splayed across the entryway to her house in a pool of blood .
 About 20,000 people attended a Bangalore rally in her honor a week later . Her friend marveled not only at the number of supporter but at their variety : writer , student , activist , member of the marginalized Dalit and Adivasi community , transgender woman , rickshaw driver , landless farmer , Muslims , Christians . Large “ I Am Gauri ” demonstration arose nationwide in outrage at the increasing attack , rhetorical and physical , on Indian journalist . Narendra Modi , the prime minister , routinely tweet condolence after airplane crash in foreign country but made no comment about Lankesh ’ s murder .
 The Committee to Protect Journalists ha been keeping track of 35 case of Indian journalist murdered specifically for their work since 1992 , and only two of these case have resulted in a successful conviction . “ There seems to be a license that people feel to beat up or attack journalist in India , ” Steven Butler , the coordinator of the committee ’ s Asia program , told me when I met him in December 2017 . As we spoke , his phone buzzed : Another journalist had been arrested in Kashmir .
 India ’ s newspaper culture ha long been among the most varied and vigorous in the world , which the country ’ s free-speech law help enable . But the protection offered by those law have always been a tenuous a they are broad . The country ha no explicit constitutional protection of freedom of the press , and the law that do exist are easily curtailable in the interest of security , public decency or religious sentiment . Its sluggish judicial system can be exploited to harass journalist , and endemic corruption forever threatens to compromise their work .
 The situation ha unquestionably deteriorated over the past several year — a fact that owes much to the ascent of the B.J.P . In the 2014 election , the party won 282 of the 545 seat in the lower house of India ’ s Parliament , which determines the prime ministership . The Congress Party , which ha led nearly every Indian government since independence , won only 44 .
 Political pressure on journalist is nothing new in India , but the current government is the first in many year to treat them a an ideological enemy . Since he took office in 2014 , Modi ha not held a single news conference in India . Among B.J.P . politician , a popular term for journalist is “ presstitutes. ” A dispatch on Indian journalism last year by the Committee to Protect Journalists described an unprecedented climate of self-censorship and fear , reporting , “ The medium is in the worst state India ha ever seen . ”
 In these circumstance , Lankesh ’ s audacity and integrity were all the more notable . And her murder ha deepened the chill . The anonymous author of Humans of Hindutva , a popular Facebook page satirizing the religious right wing , abruptly shut it down twice in 2017 after posting about receiving death threat ( though the page ha since returned ) . “ I have no desire to end up like Gauri Lankesh , ” the author wrote . A young investigative reporter named Aruna Chandrasekhar told me that Lankesh ’ s example had been particularly inspiring to Indian woman freelance journalist , and that when she found herself feeling vulnerable while reporting a story alone in an unfamiliar place , the thought of Lankesh ’ s fearlessness used to embolden her . “ Gauri ’ s murder shook me , ” she said .
 By the end of May , national election will determine if Modi and the B.J.P . are elected to another five year . It is likely to be the ugliest campaign season in India ’ s history . Hostility toward journalist and opposition figure is intensifying a voting day approach . The investigative journalist Rana Ayyub , best known for her investigation into B.J.P . complicity in religious riot ( which Lankesh had published in a Kannada translation ) , wrote in a Times Op-Ed last year that she ha been the target of an unrelenting online assault by right-wing activist : her face wa grafted on a pornographic video ; her home address and phone number were circulated ; there were threat of gang rape .
 In August , near a public event in New Delhi called Freedom From Fear , an unknown gunman tried to shoot Umar Khalid , a student activist who wa close to Lankesh . The police last year arrested 11 opposition activist and lawyer on what appear to have been flimsy charge of instigating violence at an event in Maharashtra , and in February arrested , on apparently even thinner evidence , the prominent caste scholar Anand Teltumbde . Tensions have further risen since Feb. 14 , when a suicide bomber killed 40 Indian soldier in Kashmir , setting off a series of skirmish with Pakistan that are likely to politically benefit the B.J.P .
 Jignesh Mevani , a legislator and an activist from Gujarat , fear that if the B.J.P . is re-elected , it extremist supporter will be emboldened . “ Every year they will kill 10 to 15 of our kind of people and put 10 to 15 of our kind of people in jail , ” he told me at a July meeting in Bangalore in Lankesh ’ s honor . “ So by the time they are in power for a decade , the major face of the progressive civil right movement of this country will be gone . ”
 Lankesh ’ s murder seemed to fit what wa by then an unmistakable pattern of assassination of intellectual who opposed the fundamentalist-Hindu ideology that animates the B.J.P. , all of which remained unsolved . Between 2013 and 2015 , three religiously freethinking Indian writer and activist were shot dead near their home by assailant who escaped on motorcycle : the doctor Narendra Dabholkar , in Pune ; the politician Govind Pansare , in Kolhapur ; and the scholar M.M . Kalburgi , in Dharwad . After Kalburgi ’ s murder , score of Indian writer returned their award from the National Academy of Letters to protest both the lack of progress in the murder investigation and the B.J.P. ’ s silence over rising intolerance , to no effect . There wa much anxious speculation over who might be the next writer to die . But few thought it would be Lankesh , in part simply because she lived in Bangalore .
 Situated on a plateau at the center of India ’ s southern triangle , Bangalore ha a mild climate year-round , a condition that seems to have nourished the city ’ s reputation a an easygoing , tolerant place . It is often said that the city ’ s slogan is the Kanglish phrase “ swalpa adjust maadi ” — or , “ please adjust a little. ” Bangalore reflects India ’ s diversity — it mélange of culture , language , religion and history — more than most place . It is a city that attracts migrant from all over India , few of whom speak Kannada , the official language of Karnataka , a their primary tongue . India ’ s science-research effort have centered on Bangalore for more than a century a ha , in recent decade , it information-technology industry , and the city consequently ha one of the world ’ s most educated work force . By some account , it most intractable problem is traffic . According to the Karnataka Police , a year can pas in Bangalore without a single instance of a gun used in a crime .
 To many Bangaloreans , Lankesh ’ s murder felt like the violent announcement of the end of an era — an era that had arguably sprung from the imagination of Lankesh ’ s father , P. Lankesh . A commanding figure with huge eyeglass and a generous mustache , Lankesh wa a compulsively productive , endlessly quarrelsome English professor , fiction writer , poet , playwright , filmmaker , essayist and journalist . He dominated and in many way dictated the cultural and political discourse in the state of Karnataka to a degree unimaginable before or after the 20 year in which he edited Lankesh Patrike , the tabloid he founded in 1980 .
 Gauri Lankesh ’ s ex-husband , the journalist Chidanand Rajghatta , describes Lankesh Patrike — the name , in Kannada , simply mean “ Lankesh ’ s newspaper ” — a “ a weird mixture of high literary essay combined with low political tattle , ” like an unlikely merger of The New Yorker and The New York Post , but with a delightful idiom all it own . “ There wa everything in that paper : great politics , great literature , great gossip , ” the journalist Sugata Srinivasaraju told me . “ He translated Baudelaire , he translated Rimbaud , then he talked about Barthes . You are sitting in this corner of Karnataka and you are being introduced to the world . ”
 Gauri Lankesh grew up in her father ’ s shadow , and at first she kept her distance from the Kannada literary scene he personified . She and Rajghatta took job in Delhi , far from Karnataka , and wrote exclusively in English . “ We were completely Anglicized , ” Rajghatta told me . “ Deracinated . We ’ d forgotten our roots. ” When P. Lankesh died in 2000 , it wa unthinkable that anyone could fill his shoe — least of all his daughter , who wa then barely literate in Kannada . But her family legacy proved irresistible , and she moved back to Bangalore to serve a the paper ’ s editor .
 It wa an impossible job , but Lankesh found she loved it . She never approached her father ’ s literary talent in Kannada but wa his equal in pluck . Shortly after she assumed the editorship , a journalist interviewing her noted that her father had often been threatened and insulted by his critic . “ I am not afraid of physical attack at all , ” she said . “ Being a woman is my security right now . ”
 The job radicalized her . After spending much of her adult life removed from Karnataka , she suddenly found herself immersed in it problem : the labor complaint of Bangalore ’ s municipal sanitation worker or the persistence of retrograde local superstition such a made snana , wherein lower-caste Hindus roll on the ground over leftover food from a ceremonial meal eaten by Brahmins . ( The practice wa finally outlawed in Karnataka in 2017 . ) The experience transformed her into a leftist and an activist , and Lankesh Patrike transformed with her . Its new direction led to an ideological rift with the paper ’ s owner and publisher , her brother Indrajit . In 2005 , she left the paper , and the next week she started a new tabloid of her own : Gauri Lankesh Patrike .
 In a cave high in the mountain of central Karnataka there is a religious shrine called Baba Budangiri . It is named for Baba Budan , a Muslim Sufi saint who lived there in the 16th century and who is credited in legend with introducing coffee to India . The shrine ha functioned for century a a place of worship for Muslims and Hindus alike . Hinduism ha always resisted any universally satisfactory definition , and syncretic site like Baba Budangiri are the religion ’ s frontier , where Hinduism ’ s porousness is most evident . In any religion , the regulation of such site is the surest sign of a hard shift toward orthodoxy — toward an attempt to rigidly define doctrine and heresy . Around 30 year ago , right-wing activist began organizing large , festive religious rally at Baba Budangiri , eventually demanding that it should be declared an exclusively Hindu site .
 In 2001 , Lankesh visited the site a part of a delegation of literary figure on a fact-finding mission about the controversy . Soon she wa not simply reporting on the situation but diving into it , headlining counterdemonstration and making political connection for the activist . Shiva Sundar , her closest colleague in her journalism and in her activism , told me that in 2003 the police had refused permission for a protest in the nearest town . But Lankesh wa determined to be arrested , so she sneaked into town wearing a burqa , then threw it off when she reached the police station and shouted slogan until she wa hauled into custody .
 The dispute over Baba Budangiri wa the latest in a long series of battle over two rival idea of India . One idea is the pluralist , multireligious , multicultural vision on which the country wa founded in 1947 . The other is known a Hindutva : a fundamentalist , majoritarian movement that seek to codify and enforce orthodox Hinduism and to define India a an explicitly Hindu country ( despite the fact that India ha the second-largest Muslim population in the world ) . The most important Hindutva organization is the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh , or R.S.S. , a powerful Hindu-nationalist paramilitary group — rank-and-file member line up daily to perform physical training drill in white-and-brown uniform — that wa founded in 1925 and reportedly ha million of member . The Hindutva group affiliated with the R.S.S . are known collectively a the Sangh Parivar . One of them is the Bharatiya Janata Party .
 Many of India ’ s worst internal conflict have occurred along the pluralist-Hindutva fault line . In 1948 , a former R.S.S . member named Nathuram Godse assassinated Mohandas Gandhi over what he felt wa Gandhi ’ s preferential treatment of Muslims . In 1992 , a crowd of Hindutva activist , accompanied by B.J.P . politician , tore down a 450-year-old mosque in the north Indian city of Ayodhya ; ensuing nationwide riot left approximately 1,000 people dead , most of them Muslims . In 2002 , a train car carrying Hindutva activist from Ayodhya to the state of Gujarat caught fire under circumstance that remain highly disputed , killing 59 ; riot in Gujarat killed around 1,000 people , again mostly Muslims . ( Narendra Modi , who wa then chief minister of Gujarat , ha been accused of allowing the riot ; before he wa elected prime minister , he wa denied a visa to visit the United States on those ground . ) It wa in this context that Sangh Parivar and B.J.P . leader began talking about making Baba Budangiri “ the Ayodhya of the south . ”
 The Congress Party , whose politics are generally secular and social democratic , ha undoubtedly been guilty at time of suppressing the press and of condoning the mass slaughter of religious minority . But many Indian liberal fear that the B.J.P. ’ s overwhelming victory in 2014 mark the most profound threat to India ’ s democracy and pluralism since it founding . The B.J.P . had controlled the prime ministership before , for six year , after breaking the Congress Party ’ s longtime hold on the office in the 1998 election , but only a part of a coalition government that required it to tamp down it hard-line position . In 2014 , it won in a landslide , and a B.J.P . re-election this year would be seen a a mandate to fully implement the party ’ s ideology . In the B.J.P. ’ s rhetoric , being Indian is equated with being Hindu , and religious minority are spoken of a if they were foreigner . Critics are branded a “ anti-national. ” Advocates of a secular Indian state — which the Indian constitution call for in it very first sentence — are called “ sickulars . ”
 Such talk ha already emboldened a surge of vigilantism . Since the B.J.P . took power , what is known a “ cow protection ” ha become increasingly a matter of national politics — the cow hold religious importance to many Hindus — and lynch mob have murdered score of people , largely Muslims , suspected of slaughtering or selling cattle . In July of last year , a B.J.P . minister invited to his home eight men who had been convicted in such a lynching and presented them with garland and sweet . In January 2018 , after an 8-year-old Muslim girl wa repeatedly raped and then murdered in a Hindu temple , two B.J.P . minister attended a rally in support of the men accused of raping and murdering her .
 By the time the B.J.P . won in 2014 , Lankesh had , for nearly a decade , been using her own newspaper to thrust herself into the center of local debate over Hindu nationalism . Gauri Lankesh Patrike mostly jettisoned the literary entertainment and ideological unclassifiability that characterized her father ’ s paper and evolved into a single-minded political broadside against the right wing . Shiva Sundar described Gauri Lankesh Patrike a “ a weekly threat to their philosophy . Every page . Even the film page had something to say about egalitarian value and to condemn these people . ”
 Its mission wa earnest , but it tone wa typically puckish ( often in way that defy translation into English ) . The cover image on the issue published the week before Lankesh wa murdered depicted the bald head of Amit Shah , the president of the B.J.P. , under the headline “ The Story of a Saffron Egg. ” ( Saffron is Hindutva ’ s chosen color , and the headline nodded to a popular movie at the time , “ Story of an Egg. ” ) “ Everything on the cover wa harsh , ” the journalist Sugata Srinivasaraju said . “ A lot of time it wa below the belt . ”
 Lankesh sometimes got death threat at the office , either by phone or by mail . “ She would ignore it , ” her colleague Satish said . “ She would say , ‘ Who will shoot me ? ’ We didn ’ t take it seriously. ” Like her father , she often treated political argument like sport . “ She loved it , ” Lankesh ’ s sister , Kavitha Lankesh , said . “ She loved fighting , she loved voicing her view , she took great pleasure in standing up for people . She would make a joke , saying , ‘ I am on the hit list , ’ and she felt proud to say that . ”
 More than once , her subject reported her to the police for criminal defamation and libel . Such charge rarely hold up in Indian court , but they are effective in harassing journalist because the accused must show up in court wherever the charge is filed . Lankesh ’ s opponent would file case all over the state , which ate up her time and resource . She took the opportunity to make connection . When she had to appear before a judge in some distant town , she would often schedule a political meeting there . Her friend say she learned the best place to eat all over Karnataka . “ All these guy did in harassing her actually helped her , ” her lawyer , Venkatesh Bubberjung , said . “ Her sphere of influence increased multifold . ”
 Still , he would advise Lankesh to be more careful in her word . “ She ’ d say : ‘ I am going to call a scoundrel a scoundrel ! It ’ s your job to defend me , ’ ” he said . In November 2016 she wa finally convicted in a criminal defamation case over a story she published eight year earlier claiming that several B.J.P . leader had defrauded a jeweler and wa sentenced to six month in jail . ( The sentence wa immediately suspended , and when she wa killed , she wa awaiting appeal . )
 I asked Venkatesh if Lankesh ’ s rhetoric went overboard at time . “ Frequently , not at time ! ” he said . “ Whenever you put her on a stage to speak , you don ’ t know what ’ s going to get into her . She said Hinduism is not a religion at all . Her speech wa sometimes very intemperate. ” In one example that particularly offended her opponent , in response to a campaign to mail sanitary napkin to Modi to protest a new tax on menstrual hygiene product , she suggested on Twitter that woman mail napkin that had already been used .
 But Lankesh had defender among mainstream Indian liberal too , like the historian Ramachandra Guha . “ There is no such thing a overboard , ” he insisted , pointedly paraphrasing an adage that had been a favorite of the former B.J.P . prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee : “ The answer to a piece of writing is another piece of writing . It ’ s not murdering someone . ”
 We were sitting in Koshy ’ s , a cozy old restaurant that ha long been the favored watering hole for Bangalore writer . Guha said he had run into Lankesh several time there . “ Certainly Gauri wa killed because of what she said — and because she ’ s a woman , ” he said . “ Patriarchal society can not abide independent-minded woman . And we are an extremely patriarchal society still . ”
 The day after Lankesh wa murdered , Guha said in a video interview that it wa very likely that her murderer came from the Sangh Parivar , the family of Hindutva organization . The B.J.P. ’ s youth wing sent him a letter , written by a former B.J.P . state attorney general , demanding that Guha apologize for the statement or face defamation charge . “ Of course it ’ s all part of an attempt to silence and intimidate , ” Guha told me . “ The B.J.P. , which is a cadre-based , ideological party , is increasingly a party of thug and vigilante . And that spread . And so instead of making speech , you intimidate and threaten . And of course there ’ s acquiescence from the top leadership . They never say anything . Amit Shah and Modi say nothing if violence is committed in the name of Hindutva — never . ”
 Throughout the past five year of national B.J.P . rule , the party and it ally have controlled a majority of state government , too : currently 16 out of India ’ s 29 state , down from it peak of 21 last year . ( India ’ s political system is parliamentary and federalist , with power distributed between the central and state government . ) South India is the only region where the Hindutva party ha never had much luck . “ Communal , radical , hard-line right-wing politics is an import to Karnataka , ” Srinivasaraju told me .
 But Karnataka is the southern state where the B.J.P . may have fought hardest to gain a foothold . The party like to call Karnataka it “ gateway to the south. ” It ’ s the only southern state the B.J.P . ha ever governed , from 2008 to 2013 . And it nearly took power again in state election last year , eight month after Lankesh ’ s murder .
 In the state Legislative Assembly election ( which take place every five year ) in 2008 , the B.J.P . ran and won in Karnataka on bread-and-butter issue ; religious ideology took a back seat , a it usually doe in southern election . But in the 2018 state election season , the B.J.P . opposition leader of Karnataka ’ s Assembly promised that the party ’ s first bill after victory would be a statewide ban on cattle slaughter . This election “ is not about road , drinking water or gutter , ” the B.J.P . legislator Sanjay Patil said at a rally in April 2018 . “ This election is about a battle between Hindus and Muslims. ” It wa one of the most religiously divisive election campaign any southern state had ever seen , and it won a plurality of the state ’ s 222 seat , just nine short of a majority , though the B.J.P . failed to form a coalition that would put it in power .
 One afternoon in January 2018 , a few month before that election , I went to the B.J.P . headquarters in Bangalore to discus Lankesh ’ s murder with five local party leader . We met in the building ’ s library , and a we spoke a growing assemblage of B.J.P . member crowded against it glass door to catch a glimpse of Malavika Avinash , a popular Kannada-language actress who moonlight a a B.J.P . spokeswoman . Outside the room , party member chanted party slogan .
 “ See , there are two version to this story , ” Avinash said . “ Everyone ha their own conspiracy theory about who might have killed her or who would have benefited by killing her. ” Many observer had noted that Lankesh , like the three previous assassination victim , Dabholkar , Pansare and Kalburgi , wa particularly critical of Hindutva . But the theory Avinash pointed to , a did every other Hindutva adherent I met , wa that underground Maoist revolutionary had killed Lankesh because she helped some of their comrade negotiate re-entry into society . “ There were allegation that she perhaps , in a sense , sold them to the state government , ” Avinash said . “ But nobody know who did it yet . ”
 At first the B.J.P . representative spoke carefully to me about Lankesh , but soon their complaint began tumbling out . They repeatedly accused her of yellow journalism , of Hindu-bashing and of “ character assassination ” against them — an unfortunate choice of word about the victim of a literal assassination . “ She wa extremely scathing , ” Avinash said . “ Language that wa unbecoming of a journalist. ” Anytime they sensed they were piling on too much , they added the caveat that murder , of course , wa wrong . “ She did live in a very remote place , ” Avinash said . “ She lived alone and didn ’ t care , really . She should have perhaps cared for her own safety . ”
 The slogan-chanting outside the room grew louder . After our interview concluded , I followed the noise downstairs and found a crowd of men festively hoisting a newly minted B.J.P . legislator on their shoulder ; they were celebrating the recent defection to the B.J.P . of several politician from rival party . In the crowd I met a friendly middle-aged journalist named S.A. Hemantha Kumar who introduced me to Sabitha Rao , a B.J.P . supporter who used to work for a mainstream newspaper called the Deccan Herald . When Kumar learned I wa writing about Lankesh , he excitedly gave me a copy of an issue of the magazine he writes for , a right-wing weekly called Uday India , with a cover story on Lankesh . Kumar ’ s own article described her a “ a so-called journalist with a devious agenda , dubious character & malicious intent . ”
 “ She had a concern for the poor , no doubt about it , ” Kumar said of Lankesh . “ She wa a very passionate person , eccentric and perverse . Pervert thinking . She had no child . A strange marriage . But she had a lot of boyfriend . That ha nothing to do with it , just telling you . She wa taking drug a of late. ” ( There is no evidence that this wa the case . )
 “ Substances , ” Rao said .
 “ She wa drinking , she wa smoking , she had taken to drug , ” Kumar continued . “ She lived alone . Huge house. ” ( It is actually fairly modest , and her mother owned it . ) “ She wa not a good journalist . ”
 “ Very coarse , ” Rao said .
 “ Very coarse , ” Kumar agreed . “ But ultimately , killing is sad . Killing is not acceptable . You can not justify it . ”
 This seemed like the final word until Rao added : “ She behaved like a 16-year-old . She wa always living on the edge . Reckless , I ’ d say . She paid for it . ”
 For nearly half a year after Lankesh ’ s murder , there were no arrest , and nearly everyone following the case seemed to be resigned to the fact that this would be just another unsolved assassination . But then , in May , the Karnataka Police ’ s special investigation team filed a charge sheet against a Hindutva activist named K.T . Naveen Kumar , running to some 650 page and accusing him of criminal conspiracy , among other thing . Fifteen more suspect have been arrested and charged in the month since then ; all are in jail awaiting trial and are expected to plead not guilty . Police are still searching for two more .
 The accused include a young utensil salesman named Parashuram Waghmare , who the police say confessed to pulling the trigger . The police also say that Waghmare wasn ’ t familiar with Lankesh when the conspirator asked him to kill her , so they showed him YouTube video of her speech to persuade him to commit the murder . They gave him 10,000 rupee , or around $ 150 . Members of a Hindutva group called Sri Ram Sene started a Facebook fund-raising campaign to support his family . ( The group ’ s leader , Pramod Muthalik , later denied any connection to Waghmare . )
 According to the police , forensics indicated that the gun that killed Lankesh wa potentially also used in two of the three other unsolved assassination that seemed to fit the same pattern . The police suspect that the accused are part of an apparently nameless , multistate right-wing assassination network with at least 60 member . Many of the accused have connection with a small , secretive Hindutva group called the Sanatan Sanstha , member of which have previously been arrested a suspect in four separate bombing of public place . ( The case are ongoing ; two Sanatan Sanstha member were convicted of one blast but are out on bail awaiting appeal . )
 The more established Hindutva organization , including the R.S.S . ( the Hindu-nationalist paramilitary group ) and B.J.P. , have tried to distance themselves from such group and have raised legal complaint against those who have tried to connect them to violence perpetrated by the Hindutva fringe . In February , a magistrate ruled that Rahul Gandhi , the president of the Congress Party , would stand trial for defamation for implying a link between the R.S.S . and Lankesh ’ s murder .
 Late one night I met with N.P . Amruthesh , the lawyer for four of the accused men , who is himself a proud follower of the Sanatan Sanstha . An affable man , seemingly indifferent to appearance , he wore a worn orange dhoti and white shirt with a blue ink stain billowing out beneath the pocket . While we spoke , a news segment about Lankesh ’ s case appeared on his TV : The R.S.S. , it wa reported , had issued a statement saying that the latest man arrested , Mohan Nayak , who is not represented by Amruthesh , wa not a member of the organization . Amruthesh laughed . “ In my opinion , personal opinion , that is not correct , ” he said . “ When any person is working for Hindutva , it is your duty to give protection to that person . ... They ’ re claiming that he ’ s not our member , but I came to know that he always go to R.S.S . activity and everything . These organization , they don ’ t want to take the responsibility. ” Such disavowal , he said , were bad for morale .
 Narendra Modi , meanwhile , ha kept his silence . He ha never publicly mentioned Lankesh ’ s name or referred to her case . “ Why should Prime Minister Modi react ? ” Muthalik , the Sri Ram Sene leader , said in a public speech . “ Do you expect Modi to respond every time a dog dy in Karnataka ? ”
 Perhaps the most extraordinary discovery the police have made in their investigation of Lankesh ’ s murder is a detailed diary recovered from the home of a leading suspect . In it were two list , ostensibly of people the conspirator wanted dead , reportedly including Veerabhadra Chennamalla , a liberal-minded Hindu priest , and K.S . Bhagavan , an outspokenly atheist Shakespeare scholar . First on one of the list wa Girish Karnad , who is perhaps the greatest living Kannada playwright . All have been particularly forthright in their criticism of Hindutva .
 Second on one list wa Lankesh . In the month since she wa shot , some of her friend and colleague have grown more cautious about what they write and say and post to social medium , even a this year ’ s unusually fraught and uncertain Election Day approach . Others have found themselves speaking out almost compulsively where they wouldn ’ t have before . Prakash Raj , a popular film actor and friend of Lankesh ’ s who had previously been quiet on politics , is now running for office on what could be called the Gauri platform . “ When we buried Gauri , we were actually sowing her , ” he said at a literary festival in January . “ They thought she could be silenced , but she life through u . And if I end up in the Parliament , it will be Gauri ’ s voice that will be heard there. ” When the B.J.P . came to national power in the past , it seemed to have won despite it ideology , campaigning on le divisive issue . But this year ’ s election feel like a referendum on Hindutva : Is India primarily a country for Hindus , or , a Lankesh insisted , for everyone who ’ s Indian ?
 The last two people to have a real conversation with Lankesh were two old friend , Madhu Bhushan and Kalpana Chakravarthy , who dropped by the newspaper office on the afternoon of the day she wa murdered to search the archive of Lankesh Patrike , her father ’ s newspaper , for poem that Chakravarthy ’ s husband used to submit . They ended up sitting and talking for two and a half hour , a if time had stopped and none of them had anything to do , even though Lankesh ’ s paper wa supposed to go to press the next day .
 I met Bhushan , a feminist activist , four month later at Hotel Chalukya , whose restaurant is famous for it big , red triangular dosas . As she ate , she marveled at the vitality , the appetite for life and fight and fun that Lankesh had displayed just hour before she died . I asked what they talked about . “ What didn ’ t we talk about ? ” Bhushan said . “ It wa an incredible conversation . We were catching up on 20 years. ” They talked about their shared college day , about the era of P. Lankesh , but most of all , “ nice , juicy gossip. ” Friends had been urging Lankesh to get police protection , but Bhushan recalled Lankesh ’ s telling her : “ I ’ ve had one marriage . I don ’ t need a policeman who will replace my husband . ”
 They talked and laughed until around 6 p.m. As I often saw when Lankesh ’ s friend spoke of her , Bhushan ’ s eye glowed a she recounted the time she spent with her , a though the pleasure of her company still lingered . “ She wa a very , very genuine human being , ” she said . “ I guess that ’ s the most radical thing one can be. ” /•/

 Who is Ivo van Hove and why are theatergoer saying such ( thrilling ) ( furious ) ( mystified ) thing about him ? How did the unassuming Belgian director , who since 2001 ha made the theater company Toneelgroep Amsterdam his base of operation , turn into the most important auteur on the international stage circuit — and now a three-time Broadway director ?
 With Mr. van Hove ’ s divisive production of “ Network ” earning more than $ 1 million a week on Broadway — having Bryan Cranston a your star doesn ’ t hurt — The New York Times gathered three writer who have followed his path for nearly two decade .
 In this edited conversation , Ben Brantley , co-chief theater critic for The Times , and the critic Elisabeth Vincentelli and Jason Zinoman aim to make sense of Mr. van Hove ’ s ascent , from Off Broadway to a Tony Award , David Bowie to “ All About Eve. ” With a Broadway revival of “ West Side Story ” looming on the 60-year-old director ’ s docket , the theater editor , Scott Heller , kept them from rumbling .
 [ Read about seven other adventurous director . ]
 SCOTT HELLER How rare it is to be meeting for a three-way debate about … a theater director ?
 JASON ZINOMAN A pleasure , really . And a testament to the success of Ivo van Hove .
 BEN BRANTLEY And who would have thought , when he first started his explosive demolition of hallowed classic at New York Theater Workshop in the late 1990s , that he would become a mainstream force .
 ZINOMAN I wa trying to think ( and maybe you can help me ) of another artist who ha transitioned from experimental theater to the red-hot center of Broadway with a much success . Richard Foreman wa on Broadway , I believe , twice . Peter Brook ha a longer résumé but hasn ’ t been on Broadway since 1984 .
 HELLER Julie Taymor ?
 ELISABETH VINCENTELLI The only artist with this kind of crossover success are musician or visual artist . Someone like Philip Glass , for instance . But American theater is different : the entry gate to the mainstream is guarded ferociously .
 BRANTLEY And when you think of how many American avant-gardists ( Peter Sellars , Robert Wilson ) have had to go to Europe to experience popular acclaim , it ’ s all the more astonishing . His 2015 “ View From the Bridge , ” which turned Arthur Miller ’ s kitchen-sink drama into majestic tragedy , wa the turning point , I suppose .
 HELLER Let ’ s talk about the mainstream . Has van Hove tailored his aesthetic for mass consumption , or are theater audience more primed than ever for what he ha to offer ? And , even before that , try to capture for u why , at his best , he excites each of you — and I promise , we ’ ll get to why he frustrates , too !
 VINCENTELLI I ’ ve seen almost all his New York show since “ A Streetcar Named Desire ” in 1999 , and I don ’ t feel his aesthetic ha changed much , if at all . What ha changed is the American audience ’ s willingness to enter his world . He ’ s a brilliant director of visuals , which put him in sync with our incredibly visual culture .
 BRANTLEY Agreed , Elisabeth . And the fact that he introduced video camera into his mise en scène so early a a mean of seeing , literally , different face ( and facet ) of his character certainly jibe with a screen-dominated moment in culture .
 ZINOMAN He creates a kind of chaos onstage , with all the point of view . You often never know where to look .
 VINCENTELLI Plenty of Broadway show are actually very high-tech , but their use of technology tends to be kept behind the scene . Van Hove brings the artifice to the forefront .
 BRANTLEY And he doe that with acting itself , making u aware of the various trick and trope performer use and how they manipulate that ultimate tool of acting , the human body .
 HELLER You ’ ve all written about video a a stage tool going back decade — the Wooster Group and beyond . The same with stylized acting style . What happens when van Hove applies these technique to familiar text — Shakespeare ? A novel like “ The Fountainhead ” ? And movie — so many , many movie , re-enacted onstage ?
 BRANTLEY I ’ m glad you mentioned the Wooster Group , because they really pioneered the multicamera , multi-mic art of disorientation . Van Hove us these thing specifically to illuminate the text , I think , sometimes in rather literal-minded way . But he also — in two of his epic examination of corrupting tyranny , “ Kings of War ” and “ The Damned ” — allows u to see behind the scene of the corridor of power , so we ’ re always aware of several level of action happening at once .
 ZINOMAN I no longer think van Hove adjusts his technique to fit or illuminate the text so much a he shoehorn the material into his particular aesthetic . He ’ s become a rigid if often stunning stylist , whose longtime collaboration with the designer Jan Versweyveld is his most important partnership . One hallmark is shooting a scene on the street that is then projected in the theater . It invariably get a laugh when the audience see New York pedestrian acting baffled by actor performing near hot dog cart . It ’ s the kind of cheap laugh David Letterman would get when he took camera on the street . But the backdrop is Nazi Germany in “ The Damned ” and a medium hellscape in “ Network. ” His use of medium here is jarringly at odds with the content in a way I am not sure he is in control of .
 BRANTLEY I do think one of his concern is to erase border and tear down wall , not just to rattle u with avant-garde self-consciousness , but to suggest our own kinship with the people onstage . He did this more effectively in “ The Damned , ” I thought , by beginning with the cast in civvies and letting the character ’ preparation for the big party that begin the show become our entry point into the story .
 ZINOMAN While I think of him a more interested in form than content , he seems right now very focused on politics .
 VINCENTELLI The “ one size fit all ” accusation isn ’ t entirely off-base . ( It reminds me of accusation lobbed at Robert Wilson , also not off-base . ) What concern me a bit is the reliance on multimedia these day , which wasn ’ t always the case in van Hove ’ s earlier show . I wonder if it ha something to do with an overuse of film a source material . I wish he ’ d go back to the classic !
 BRANTLEY But he ’ s le a one-trick pony than his reputation would have it . Remember his viscerally immediate , relatively technology-free adaptation of Bergman ’ s “ Scenes From a Marriage ” a few year ago ? He cast three different set of performer a the same couple at different age , and it universalized our ( or at least my ) identification with them . I think , oddly enough for a modernist , he ’ s a universalist .
 VINCENTELLI All the talk about multimedia obscures his amazing work with actor . The performance he get from them can be stunning . I remember them more than the video gewgaw .
 HELLER Give me an example .
 VINCENTELLI Toneelgroep ’ s Hans Kesting , strikingly physical a Richard III ( “ Kings of War ” ) and Mark Antony ( “ Roman Tragedies ” ) .
 BRANTLEY How about Saoirse Ronan ’ s malevolent serving girl in “ The Crucible ” ? Or Elizabeth Marvel ’ s flayed , viscera-exposing performance in “ A Streetcar Named Desire ” and “ The Little Foxes ” ?
 ZINOMAN I ’ m not much of a believer that van Hove is great for actor . But Ben reminds me of another admirable trait : his gutsy conceptual flourish . In “ The Crucible ” he dared to suggest that the witch might in fact be real . I had never seen this before . I didn ’ t find the execution of this idea to have enough conviction to completely work , but respect the attempt .
 VINCENTELLI It ’ s hard to overestimate the impact his European upbringing ha on his work on American and British classic , like “ The Crucible. ” He doesn ’ t come to them with the same baggage . This doe not always entirely pan out , but when it doe , the result are illuminating — “ View From the Bridge ” is a perfect example .
 HELLER Let ’ s circle back to Jason ’ s point about van Hove ’ s politics . “ Network ” end with a controversial flourish , in which we watch footage of president being inaugurated since the 1970s , culminating with Trump . The audience howl . Is this merely playing to the crowd ?
 BRANTLEY Absolutely . It ’ s pandering and unnecessary . Many of my problem with “ Network ” have to do with the source material . What wowed me about the production , though , wa Bryan Cranston ’ s stunning performance a a man made by medium — and the way that guy interacted with the onstage camera , and his own reflected image !
 VINCENTELLI I agree with Ben , that wa a cheap shot .
 HELLER So capture for me how or when van Hove make richer , more bracing political argument .
 ZINOMAN He doesn ’ t . “ Network ” is not an anomaly . The only person who hammer television a much and broadly a the artist behind “ Network ” is Trump himself . In other hand , some of this would be played a satire , a in the original movie . But van Hove , a far a I can tell , is incapable of a sense of humor . His one mode is epic , grim , relentless tragedy .
 BRANTLEY He is a tragedian , first and foremost , though I think we can make room for tragedian in a time when they ’ re a rare breed among director . No , he lack a sense of satire and even of irony , except in a cosmic sense . What I think fascinates him and what often work for me , is the idea of monolithic personality , damned to suffocate under their own passion ( or ego ) . That wa true of Mark Strong ’ s amazing Eddie Carbone in “ View From the Bridge ” and the monarch from “ Kings of War . ”
 VINCENTELLI I don ’ t think of him a a political director at all . Sometimes I feel he stumble into it , but that ’ s not his primary or even secondary mode . What he doe best is excavate new reading from play you thought you knew — subtext from text . For instance , he had Bruce McKenzie play Stanley in “ Streetcar , ” an actor who ’ s not the beefy , hypermasculine guy people commonly associate with that character . That wa revelatory to me — the shape masculinity can take .
 ZINOMAN I want to go back to the idea that his character , a Ben put it , are damned . I agree . And doomed . This unifies much of his work : Everything is inexorable . But there are drawback to this , particularly a he work with an increasing diversity of material ( next up : “ West Side Story ” ) . He seems uninterested in creating suspense or generating surprise , except through visual flourish .
 BRANTLEY For me , one of his most remarkable gift is his ability to sustain a feeling of suspense ( that Götterdämmerung doom ) even though you know where you ’ re headed . And it work with dark , monumental classic like “ View ” and “ The Crucible. ” Curiously , his one attempt at Greek tragedy that I ’ ve seen , an “ Antigone ” starring Juliette Binoche , wa utterly uninvolving .
 VINCENTELLI I ’ m fine with him always working in the same register . Are we complaining that Jerry Zaks always doe comedy ? He ’ s brilliant at it . As for gimmickiness — that criticism isn ’ t aimed at , say , Richard Nelson , whose Apple Family play are just a gimmicky . But because they are in a familiar naturalistic mode , nobody notice or care . What van Hove is doing is loosening up , if only a bit , the naturalistic grip on mainstream American stage . That ’ s a big deal in our world .
 ZINOMAN Now that he ’ s getting to work on the most prominent stage of the commercial theater , I do think his range matter . We agree “ View From the Bridge ” wa wonderful . But is he the right director for “ West Side Story ” ? This question is no longer academic .
 HELLER Part of what ha gotten him these opportunity is the embrace of critic like the three of you . He ha become a name , a brand of sort , that theater fan follow . Or not . As one commenter to a Times review wrote : “ Ivan Van Hooey . Enough . Please . Make him go away . ”
 VINCENTELLI When you go to “ The Damned ” and you hear people having animated discussion — pro and con — on the street afterward , there ’ s something happening that I think is very exciting . People arguing over directorial choice ! That is just incredible to me . I ’ ll forgive “ Lazarus , ” the Bowie show , just for that .
 ZINOMAN I agree with Elisabeth that inspiring heated argument about theater directing is wonderful . But I also think we have a bias for ambition that can make u go easy on van Hove . For instance , let ’ s take the most provocative decision I have seen him make , the molestation scene in “ The Damned. ” That wa a very young actor , and he lingered in that scene in a way that wa meant to make u uncomfortable . To be fair to him , the scene wa in the film . But theater is a different medium . And when I watched it live , I didn ’ t think about the decadence of Nazi Germany or the corruption of that family or any contemporary parallel . The only thing on my mind wa that actor : How did they explain this scene to her ? Van Hove had already shown u execution , orgy , adult body smeared in blood and feather . Did we need this too ? Was it worth it ?
 BRANTLEY All of your concern were certainly on my mind when I watched . I think it would require more space than we have to justify that particular choice . But you ’ re right , it jerked u out of the moment . I , too , found myself wondering how the young actress had been prepared for that moment .
 HELLER Is sex in van Hove-world simply part and parcel of the grimness that Jason talked about ?
 VINCENTELLI I ’ ve seen woman take issue on social medium with the way his production can be physically taxing for actor . But from everything I ’ ve read , actor love working with him and the process is thorough and methodical . As for what ’ s onstage , I don ’ t find his depiction of sexuality grim . It can be brutal , manipulative , yes , but it ’ s also matter-of-fact in the way it look at power relationship and how they are expressed through sex .
 BRANTLEY I ’ m also often aware of the loneliness of the character in his production , even when they ’ re locked in carnal embrace . That wa part of what wa so beautiful to me about his interpretation of “ Angels in America ” — the hopeful futility of reaching out and touching someone . And I think he just might do well by Eve in the upcoming “ All About Eve , ” given his stage version of John Cassavetes ’ s “ Opening Night . ”
 HELLER The production do keep coming . Beyond his own work , I wonder : Has he influenced other director , or what we ’ re all seeing onstage ?
 VINCENTELLI What he doe can be expensive , and American director with ambition and idea are usually short of cash . There is not the same institutional support system a in Europe or Britain .
 BRANTLEY But I do think he ’ s opened door for director who take le traditionally naturalistic approach to theater . After all , the Daniel Fish “ Oklahoma ! ” is Broadway bound . And perhaps there ’ s a touch of van Hove in it use of merciless simulcast video and the witty contradiction between text and action .
 ZINOMAN Success doesn ’ t just lead to imitation . It expands the realm of the possible for producer .

 PARADISE , Calif. — The sky wa turning orange and the ember were flying from the Camp Fire when Oney and Donna Carrell and Donna 's father sped away from their Paradise home .
 `` I thought , 'Oh , well , the house is done , ' '' Oney Carrell said .
 A few day later , they learned otherwise . The Carrells ' home survived the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history with a couple of warped window frame , a partially charred down spout and a stubborn smoky smell inside .
 Most of their neighborhood wa destroyed . A guest house in their backyard , where Donna 's father lived , wa reduced to ash , along with a couple of shed . Yet their beautifully restored 1940 Studebaker sat untouched in the garage .
 The arc of destruction the Camp Fire carved through Paradise wa seemingly random : Why were some house saved and others incinerated ? As million of Californians brace for another wildfire season , a McClatchy analysis of fire and property record show the answer might be found in something a simple a the roof over their head — and the year their house wa built .
 A landmark 2008 building code designed for California 's fire-prone region — requiring fire-resistant roof , siding and other safeguard — appears to have protected the Carrells ' home and dozen of others like it from the Camp Fire . That year mark a pivotal moment in the state 's deadly and expensive history of destructive natural disaster .
 All told , about 51 percent of the 350 single-family home built after 2008 in the path of the Camp Fire were undamaged , according to McClatchy 's analysis of Cal Fire data and Butte County property record . By contrast , only 18 percent of the 12,100 home built prior to 2008 escaped damage . Those figure do n't include mobile home , which burned in nearly equal measure regardless of age .
 `` These are great standard ; they work , '' said senior engineer Robert Raymer of the California Building Industry Association , who consulted with state official on the building code .
 Yet despite this lesson , California may end up falling short in it effort to protect home from the next wildfire .
 Mushrooming city such a Folsom , where an 11,000-home development is springing up , have the ability to bypass the state 's safety standard in spite of considerable fire risk . The state , which offer cash incentive to bolster old home against earthquake , so far ha done nothing to get Californians to retrofit home built before 2008 for fire safety .
 It ha n't helped that housing construction went into a deep dive in 2008 and ha been slow to recover . Raymer said only 860,000 home and apartment have been built statewide since the code went into effect . That 's just 6 percent of the state 's housing stock .
 According to Cal Fire , a many a 3 million home lie within the various `` fire hazard severity zone '' around the state . Dave Sapsis , a Cal Fire wildland fire scientist , said there 's no way to know definitively how many of those home were built before 2008 , but he belief `` it 's the preponderance of them , the majority . ''
 The situation is worse in rural California , where housing construction lag but the fire hazard are among the worst in the state , Raymer said . Fewer than 3 percent of the home in the path of the Camp Fire were built after 2008 .
 `` Most of our inventory that wa here prior to the fire wa ( built ) between the '40s and the '70s , '' said Paradise Town Councilman Michael Zuccolillo , a real estate agent . `` The average home here wa from the '70s . ''
 That leaf thousand of home at risk from the next inferno across California , their wood-shake shingle waiting to ignite .
 `` What are we going to do about the existing housing stock that 's been built in these place ? '' said Max Moritz , a wildfire specialist at UC Santa Barbara . `` For the existing housing stock that 's out there , that is n't built to these code , we have a massive retrofitting issue on our hand . They have structure ignition vulnerability that are built into the situation , they 're baked into the problem . ''

 'THE WEAKEST LINK '
 The Carrells , now living in a rental in Roseville , designed their Paradise home and did much of the interior work themselves ; they knew that home wa built with fire safety in mind .
 `` I knew we were in the middle of the forest , '' Oney Carrell said during a recent visit to Paradise . `` Why would n't you do everything you could to make it last ? ''
 But even he 's amazed that their home made it . Stepping over a blackened patio drain just a few foot from the back of the house , he wondered aloud : `` I do n't know why it stopped here . ''
 It 's almost impossible to say for certain why some home are still standing in Paradise , while others were ruined . Landscaping surely played a role ; fire expert say home buffered by so-called `` defensible space '' probably did better than those wrapped in shrub . Luck wa a big factor , too , a home were no doubt spared by last-second shift in the wind .
 Nevertheless , expert say , McClatchy 's analysis reinforces their belief that California 's fire-safe building code can make a difference in an era of increasing vulnerability . Daniel Gorham , a former firefighter and U.S. Forest Service researcher who work for the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety in South Carolina , said the California code is becoming a model for other fire-prone state .
 `` California is leap and bound ahead of other part of the country , '' Gorham said . `` California is on the forefront . ''
 Advocates say fire-resistant building material are n't particularly expensive . A study last fall by Headwater Economics , a consulting firm in Bozeman , Mont. , found that `` a new home built to wildfire-resistant code can be constructed for roughly the same cost a a typical home . ''
 But getting Californians to retrofit home built before 2008 is an enormous task . The state requires property owner in fire zone who replace at least half their roof to install `` fire-retardant '' material on the entire roof . Other than that , however , there 's nothing forcing Californians to safeguard their existing home against fire hazard .
 A few California city have taken matter into their own hand . In 2008 , the City Council in Big Bear Lake , a community of 5,200 in San Bernardino County , passed an ordinance declaring wood shake shingle roof `` a severe fire hazard and danger '' and ordered homeowner to replace them by 2012 . Armed with state and federal grant , it offered cash incentive of up to $ 4,500 apiece for new roof .
 Although the grant program ha run out , `` I ca n't think of the last time I saw a shake roof in Big Bear , '' said Patrick Johnston , the city 's chief building official .
 Most Californians , however , are on their own when it come to spending the ten of thousand of dollar needed to replace a roof or install fire-resistant siding . The state offer no financial incentive for fire safety the way it doe , say , for earthquake — homeowner in quake zone can get up to $ 3,000 apiece from the state to gird their home against seismic disaster .
 There are sign , however , that the state is beginning to get more serious about retrofitting home for fire safety .
 A law signed last year by former Gov . Jerry Brown requires the state fire marshal to develop a suggested list of `` low-cost retrofit '' by January 2020 . The state would then promote these retrofit in it education and outreach effort .
 California also might start throwing cash at the problem .
 A new bill , AB 38 , introduced earlier this year by Democratic Assemblyman Jim Wood of Santa Rosa , would create a $ 1 billion `` fire hardened home revolving loan fund '' to help homeowner retrofit their property .
 The issue is personal for Wood , a dentist who spent week helping identify victim from the Camp Fire and the wine country fire of October 2017 . Although eligibility term have n't been spelled out , the bill would offer low-interest and no-interest loan to help those who otherwise could n't pay for new roof or other safeguard .
 `` A lot of these small town are not a well off financially , '' he said . `` We need to find a way to help them , especially if they 're poorer . ''
 The fund might not be nearly enough to go around — not with hundred of thousand of home in need of retrofit , and a new roof alone costing $ 10,000 or more . `` The $ 1 billion , indeed , that 's not enough to rehab every home , '' said the Building Industry Association 's Raymer . But he said it 's `` an absolutely excellent way to kick thing off . ''
 Wood said state official would have to figure out a plan for parceling out the money to where it 's needed most — probably starting with lower-income area near forest .
 `` Obviously we want to affect the area with the highest risk first , '' the assemblyman said . `` A lot of these small town are not a well off financially . We need to find a way to help them , especially if they 're poorer . ''

 MAPPING 'SEVERITY ZONES '
 The fire-safe building code had it origin in two significant fire from a generation ago — the Panorama Fire of 1980 , which spilled out of the mountain into the city of San Bernardino ; and the monstrous Oakland Hills Fire of 1991 , which wiped out 2,500 home and killed 25 people .
 In response , the Legislature ordered the Department of Fire Protection and Forestry to start mapping major fire risk in California , in the hinterland a well a urban area . The result wa a collection of map of the state 's `` fire hazard severity zone , '' encompassing more than one-third of California 's land mass .
 Based on factor such a terrain , vegetation and weather pattern , the zone represent Cal Fire 's attempt to predict the probability of a fire starting and the likelihood that it could become significant , said Cal Fire 's Sapsis .
 The map spawned tighter building standard . The Legislature mandated fire-resistant roof in these fire-prone area . Then in 2008 the state laid out a more comprehensive scheme . The California Building Standards Commission rolled out a suite of regulation , known a Chapter 7A , that set strict rule for roofing material , siding , window , deck and other element of a home built in 2008 or later — right down to the minimum spec for the wire mesh that must be installed on attic vent to keep ember out ( no more than a quarter-inch of space between the wire ) .
 Experts said the regulation seem to be particularly effective at protecting structure from the type of wildfire that are increasingly common in California , where wind gust can blow ember a mile or two ahead of the main wall of flame and do some of the worst damage .
 `` A window break , a vent break , the fire get into your home and you 've got an interior structure fire , '' said Joe Poire , the city of Santa Barbara 's fire marshal .
 Enforcement of the building code carry a few wrinkle . In the mainly rural area where Cal Fire is in charge of fire protection , the Chapter 7A code is automatically enforced in any region that Cal Fire ha designated a a `` severity zone '' — moderate , high or very high .
 In urban area that have their own fire department , the code is generally used only in spot where Cal Fire say the threat is very high . Local government have the discretion of rejecting the Cal Fire designation , and Sapsis said some city council have been squeamish about the state 's map because of fear that the Chapter 7A code will inflate construction cost , or for other reason .
 Yet interview with local official throughout California by McClatchy indicate that the vast majority of city and town go along with Cal Fire 's recommendation . Santa Barbara city official extended the building code to coastal area that had been overlooked by Cal Fire 's mapper . The map omits small portion of Paradise , but the building code is enforced across the entire town , said Paradise public information officer Colette Curtis .
 ___
 DANGER IN SANTA ROSA , FOLSOM ?
 Nevertheless , there are place where local official are reluctant to impose strict building code — even where fire ha caused catastrophe .
 Before Paradise exploded , Santa Rosa 's Coffey Park wa the poster child for recent California wildfire disaster : Five people died and 1,321 home were destroyed by the Tubbs Fire in October 2017 .
 Coffey Park wa n't subject to California 's Chapter 7A building code . It still is n't .
 Unlike some area of Santa Rosa , the neighborhood ha n't been designated a `` very high fire hazard '' zone by Cal Fire . City official are OK with that . Although developer rebuilding Coffey Park are being urged to consider fire-resistant material , city spokeswoman Adriane Mertens said the city doe n't see any reason to impose the 7A code in the neighborhood .
 `` There were very , very high wind that night , '' Mertens said . `` There were ember that were blown across the ( Highway 101 ) freeway , across six lane of freeway , into Coffey Park . ''
 Jack Cohen , a fire scientist in Montana who helped develop the 7A code , said he think Santa Rosa is committing `` an error in judgment '' by rebuilding without the safeguard .
 In any event , Cal Fire is updating it fire hazard map over the next year or so , taking into account more sophisticated data on wind and other climate factor , and Sapsis said spot such a Coffey Park could wind up designated a high-risk area . Once the map are done , any region placed inside Cal Fire 's `` very high fire '' zone will have no choice but to comply , under a bill signed into law by Brown last year .
 But there will still be way for city to skirt the state building code .
 Look at Folsom , widely considered one of the most vulnerable place in greater Sacramento to fire . The county 's hazard mitigation plan say 44,000 resident of Folsom are already at `` moderate or higher wildfire risk . ''
 Now the suburb is building a development called Folsom Ranch , eventually to be home to 25,000 people , on a parcel south of Highway 50 .
 The development is on land that used to be subject to the strict state building code . Now it is n't .
 How did that happen ? Years ago , the land wa outside Folsom 's city limit and Cal Fire wa responsible for it safety . Cal Fire 's map put the land in the `` moderate '' risk zone — a threat level high enough that , under the state 's regulation , the fire-safe building code took effect . As it happened , no construction took place during that time , city official say .
 The situation changed when the city annexed the land to forge ahead with Folsom Ranch . Because the land ha never been in the state 's `` very high '' risk zone , the city feel comfortable letting Folsom Ranch develop without the Chapter 7A building code .
 Fire Chief Felipe Rodriguez said Folsom official are still open to `` the possibility of strengthening , hardening , our future home . '' But for now , the city is only requiring homeowner ' association to implement a `` vegetation management '' plan and install fire-resistant fencing around property that abut open space area , Rodriguez said .
 Is Folsom courting danger ? Rodriguez doe n't think so . The city will build two fire station in the development and will `` be able to suppress a fire during it early stage , '' he said .

 'STICKS IN A FIREPLACE '
 The hundred of thousand of older home in fire zone are n't just more vulnerable in their own right .
 Experts say they spread danger to new home built to stricter standard .
 `` One little house built to a new standard , surrounded by a bunch of older stuff , is likely to get swamped , '' Sapsis said .
 Paradise provided a grim reminder of that problem . The Camp Fire destroyed more than 80 percent of the 4,100 mobile home in it path , whether they were built to the new code or not , according to McClatchy 's data analysis . That is n't surprising , Sapsis said , given that many of Paradise 's mobile home were jammed alongside one another in mobile home park .
 `` They 're stacked so close together , they 're like stick in a fireplace , '' Sapsis said .
 Sapsis and others say the lesson is that strong building code are n't enough . In particular , expert say community must pay more attention to how they lay out their neighborhood , allowing for firebreak and enough space between house .
 `` In the name of affordable housing , we 're moving housing closer and closer to one another , '' said Chris Dicus , a forestry and fire expert at Cal Poly , San Luis Obispo . `` That serf to have house-to-house-to-house ignition . ''
 The problem is n't limited to densely-packed urban area . `` I live in a rural community , and I have got six foot basically separating me from my neighbor , '' said Dicus , who life outside of Morro Bay .
 In addition , expert say California is struggling to enforce the state law regarding `` defensible space '' around property .
 The law requires that property owner maintain a much a 100 foot of defensible space around home and other building in and around `` a mountainous area , forest-covered land , brush-covered land , grass-covered land , or land that is covered with flammable material . '' That mean keeping tree and shrub pruned and spaced far apart . Within five foot of the building , property owner are supposed to remove anything that could catch fire : mulch , plant , woodpile and so on .
 In practice , however , enforcement of the defensible space law ha been spotty at best . Raymer , of the California Building Industry Association , said most property owner do n't understand how to maintain their yard . The state doe n't impose penalty for non-compliance , and only a few local government have chosen to do so , Raymer said .
 Legislation could change that . SB 190 , by Sen. Bill Dodd , D-Napa , would require the state fire marshal to develop a `` model defensible space program , '' including penalty , that local government could adopt .
 The problem extends beyond homeowner ' property line . Gov . Gavin Newsom , finding some rare common ground with the Trump administration , is advocating for more aggressive management of forested land .
 A thinned forest northeast of Paradise provided one of the rare victory of the Camp Fire . As the fire raged out of the tiny community of Pulga , it essentially spared the northern part of Magalia . The reason wa a series of forest-thinning project conducted in recent year and overseen by the U.S. Forest Service , Sierra Pacific Industries and the volunteer Butte County Fire Safe Council . The council also worked diligently with area resident to clear brush from their property .
 All that work `` did exactly what we hoped it would do , '' said Calli-Jane DeAnda , executive director of the council , which secured $ 1 million in grant to remove fuel from forested area . `` This investment of public money is so worth the effort . ''

 THE PARADISE 'LAB EXPERIMENT '
 The rebuilding of Paradise mean thousand of home are going to be constructed in the coming year to the stricter standard promulgated by the state in 2008 . It represents the single largest test of the effectiveness of the building code .
 `` That is an absolute lab experiment for u , '' Sapsis said .
 On the street of Paradise , though , community leader are taking a more measured view . Zuccolillo , the town councilman , said asphalt roof and stucco siding might `` give u more of a chance '' but he doubt they will guarantee Paradise 's safety .
 `` I saw metal building , metal and stucco building , burn to the ground , '' he said .
 Still , there 's plenty of evidence , all over Paradise , that the state 's building code can protect property .
 The other day , Sean Herr pulled into his driveway on the west side of Paradise , where he and his wife Dawn were raising their two young child .
 The first thing he did wa bring out the ultimate symbol of resiliency : an American flag , the same one that flew on his front porch the day of the Camp Fire .
 Like the flag , the house is still standing . The Herrs ' home , built in 2010 , suffered a bit of scorching and some interior smoke damage — the smoke is bad enough that they 're still temporarily living in Chico and are n't certain they 'll move back .
 Still , they marvel at what a close call they had . A Ford Excursion and a boat parked in the front yard , just a few foot from their porch , were destroyed . Five motorcycle locked in a shed behind the house got ruined . Most of their neighborhood is gone .
 The Herrs believe their attention to defensible space — the house is mostly encircled in gravel — and the strictness of the building code probably made the difference .
 `` Our yard and the construction of the house saved it for sure , '' Dawn Herr said , gesturing to a small scorch mark by the side of the house . `` You can see it tried to catch on fire . ''

 Euan Robertson started his job with New York City ’ s economic development team at an ominous moment . It wa Monday , Sept. 15 , 2008 , the day Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy and ignited the financial crisis .
 Mr. Robertson made his way through City Hall ’ s sprawling open office to a conference table , where he huddled with top adviser to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg .
 “ No one knew what wa going to happen or how bad it would be , ” Mr. Robertson recalled . “ But everyone agreed we ’ d better come up with a plan . ”
 The plan that emerged called for developing tech start-ups and tech worker in New York . The goal , Mr. Robertson said , wa to “ build a talent engine ” that would help make the city a magnet for coder and company .
 A decade later , there is ample evidence that the city is well on it way to achieving that goal . Amazon ’ s sudden decision last week to abandon it plan to build a big campus in Queens , in the face of protest from some local politician and community activist , is a setback — but not one that revers tech ’ s climb in the city .
 Amazon already employ 5,000 worker in New York , and the city ’ s talent pool wa the main reason , the company said , that it selected New York in November . In December , Google announced a major expansion that could double it New York work force to 14,000 over the next decade , without the rich government incentive that proved a lightning rod for the Amazon deal .
 Today , the city is home to thousand of fledgling company , and the New York region regularly rank second to the Bay Area in attracting venture capital , the lifeblood of the start-up economy . The city ’ s tech sector ha become a wellspring of job paying more than $ 150,000 on average , a major part of the local economy .
 The story of tech ’ s ascent in New York stretch back nearly two decade . It wa a bumpy path , with progress both by design and serendipity . DoubleClick , a survivor of the dot-com crash and a digital advertising pioneer , and Google , which made an early bet on the city , played key role . And the Bloomberg administration also made smart policy move .
 But tech in New York took hold mainly because entrepreneur , technologist and corporation chose the city a the place to work and live , just a the city ’ s industry were undergoing digital transformation , according to interview with more than two dozen people who contributed to the city ’ s evolution into a tech center .
 “ The truth is , we caught a wave , ” said Seth Pinsky , the president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation from 2008 to 2013 .
 Many of the city ’ s tech job are not in technology company . Instead , they are tied to industry where the city ha long been positioned a a world leader — like finance , advertising and medium . Those business face threat from the rise of the digital age , and have adapted to compete , helping to revitalize the city ’ s economy in the process . There are twice a many technology job in non-tech industry in New York a there are in technology company , according to Emsi , a labor market research firm .
 In term of economic , political and cultural impact , the finance industry dominates . But tech is gaining fast , and is where much of the growth is .
 New York ’ s confidential proposal to Amazon , code-named Project Clancy , which is filled with detailed data on the city work force and labor market , point to the change . Amazon asked , for example , which company had the most job opening in machine learning , a fundamental artificial intelligence skill . The top four , according to the proposal , were JPMorgan Chase , Goldman Sachs , Citigroup and KPMG . Tied for fifth place were Amazon and Google .

 Skilled tech worker now flock to New York from everywhere . But the homegrown talent engine that city official sought to jump-start a decade ago is also revving up . The new Cornell Tech graduate school campus on Roosevelt Island , a product of the city ’ s development plan , ha 300 student , with expansion plan for a student population of 2,000 over the next two decade . And new course , building and research institute are underway at Columbia , New York University and the City University of New York .
 And they are being lured by urban amenity — museum , theater , opera , dance , jazz club , art gallery , bar and restaurant — that offer a clear alternative to life in suburban Silicon Valley .
 “ The main resource in technology is smart people , ” said Kevin Ryan , a longtime tech entrepreneur . “ The New York tech sector is succeeding largely because New York is succeeding . ”
 Anyone designing hardware , writing code , or using a computer or a smartphone today owes a debt to the innovation developed in metropolitan New York decade ago . The first widely adopted programming language , Fortran , wa created in 1957 by young coder working for IBM in an office on East 56th Street . Their wintertime break were snowball fight in Central Park . Researchers at Bell Labs , located first in Manhattan and then suburban New Jersey , invented the transistor , the Unix operating system , and the C and C++ programming language — building block of modern computing .
 Technology innovation eventually migrated outside New York . Minicomputer maker sprang up in the Boston suburb . But the larger move wa westward , beginning in the late 1960s , when first the semiconductor business and later the personal computer industry took root in sunny Northern California .
 The 1990s internet boom opened the door to New York entrepreneur , especially in the field of new medium , with venture like Feed and Suck , popular web magazine . Start-ups clustered in the Flatiron district of Manhattan , an area known a Silicon Alley .
 When theGlobe.com , an early social medium website , went public in late 1998 , it share soared more than 600 percent , a record at the time . TheGlobe.com , like so many start-ups in Silicon Alley and Silicon Valley , collapsed when the dot-com bubble burst a couple of year later .
 Amid the dot-com meltdown , though , there wa a contrarian bet on the city , unnoticed at the time , by a fledgling start-up : Google .
 In the late summer of 2000 , Timothy Armstrong , at 29 , qualified a an internet veteran . Mr. Armstrong helped create or became a senior manager at a string of venture , and had a solid track record in internet sale and marketing when he met with Omid Kordestani , head of sale at Google .
 The company wa looking to expand , and Mr. Kordestani arranged a meeting between Mr. Armstrong and it founder , Larry Page and Sergey Brin , in Silicon Valley .
 The thinking at Google , Mr. Armstrong recalled , wa little more than that the company wanted a big advertising business , and New York wa where the ad money wa . He signed a one-page contract with no guarantee .
 “ The idea wa , if it doesn ’ t work out , no harm , no foul , ” Mr. Armstrong said .
 He became Google ’ s first employee in New York , working from his apartment on West 86th Street . The company wa not yet two year old , the internet boom had crested , and ad agency and consumer product company were skeptical about the start-up ’ s offering — text ad linked to search result .
 Mr. Armstrong wanted to buy a fax machine to handle ad order and billing . Mr . Page and Mr. Brin told him they wanted to see the order before approving the purchase .
 “ That ’ s how unsure people were about internet advertising , ” Mr. Armstrong recalled .
 But the order gradually picked up , becoming the cornerstone of the company ’ s booming business . An expansion of Google ’ s work force in New York followed .
 In 2003 , Craig Nevill-Manning , a Google computer scientist , wanted to set up an engineering and research outpost in New York . The company ’ s leader didn ’ t have high hope , assuming all the best software engineer were in Silicon Valley . But they told him he could go ahead if he could find “ Google-worthy ” talent in New York — and he did , hiring 25 people in the first year .
 Corinna Cortes , a researcher at Bell Labs , wa one of the early recruit . She joined Google to begin building a research arm in New York . Ms. Cortes lived in the West Village , had two young child and welcomed the opportunity to work on leading-edge computer science at Google and keep her city life . She enjoys theater and opera in Lincoln Center , restaurant in Greenwich Village and Soho and running trail along the Hudson River and in Central Park . She ha completed the New York City Marathon 14 time and bike to work .
 “ There wa no chance I would go to Mountain View , ” said Ms. Cortes , who now lead about 200 scientist for Google Research in New York . “ I wasn ’ t going to live in the suburb . ”
 By 2006 , Google , at that point a darling of Silicon Valley , wa settling into the city in a big way , moving into a blocklong Art Deco building in Chelsea . It needed the space , a Google would steadily enlarge it New York work force , to 7,000 today , more than half of them technical staff . In December , the company announced it would spend $ 1 billion on more office space in downtown Manhattan .
 Google ’ s relationship with the capital of the nation ’ s advertising business wa cemented in 2007 , when Google announced it would buy DoubleClick for $ 3.1 billion .
 DoubleClick , an internet ad-serving , tracking and analysis company that started in New York in 1996 , had good technology , but also close tie to brand advertiser , ad agency and online publisher . At it peak in 2000 , the company reached a stock market value of $ 12 billion , holding on after the dot-com crash .
 In 2005 , DoubleClick wa taken over by a private equity firm for $ 1.1 billion , and two year later , with it fortune improving , Google paid nearly three time a much .
 “ It wa a true diamond in the ash of the dot-com flameout , ” said Mr. Armstrong , who left Google a a senior vice president in 2009 to become chief executive of AOL .
 “ When Google bought DoubleClick , it really took off , ” said Randall Rothenberg , chief executive of the Interactive Advertising Bureau , a trade association . “ That wa an inflection point for the digital advertising business in New York . ”
 In early 2009 , with the city economy reeling , a small team in the Bloomberg administration began an extensive analysis , code-named Game Changers . The team interviewed hundred of executive , venture capitalist , urban expert and educator . It studied the technology-driven economic growth in Silicon Valley and in Israel ’ s start-up cluster in Haifa .
 It concluded that New York needed more computer engineering expertise . The city wa a world leader in finance , medium , advertising , law and consulting . Why shouldn ’ t the technology for those industry be built here ? The Bloomberg administration called it technology-promotion policy “ applied science . ”
 “ That wa our mantra , what we thought of a the yeast for changing the economy , ” said Robert Steel , the former deputy mayor for economic development . “ And applied science would be the key to making the new digital world here instead of someplace else . ”
 The city pushed applied science experiment , including start-up incubator , networking event and training and internship program , nearly all private-public partnership . But the biggest single step in the city ’ s applied science campaign wa the creation of a new graduate school focused on technology and entrepreneurial innovation .
 Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Steel ran a high-profile competition that included Columbia , New York University and Carnegie Mellon University . In the end , though , a combined bid by Cornell and the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology won out .
 The Cornell Tech proposal fully embraced the Bloomberg administration ’ s priority of blending science and industry . Graduate student ’ project at local company are a mainstay of the curriculum .
 “ In New York , people are driven by real-world problem that can be solved with technology , ” said Daniel Huttenlocher , the dean of Cornell Tech , who ha also worked in Silicon Valley and is an Amazon board member . “ In Silicon Valley , the heritage is much more to build cool technology and then figure out how it can make money . ”
 In healthy tech hub , start-ups spawn other start-ups . That ha been the pattern in Silicon Valley since the early day of chip making — young entrepreneurial refugee from Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory would go on to found Fairchild Semiconductor and later Intel .
 But in New York , the virtuous cycle of start-up reproduction ha accelerated only in recent year . It took time , entrepreneur and investor say , for the tech community in New York to build the success story , human network and self-confidence that inspire serial risk taking .
 DoubleClick , once again , wa a trailblazer a it became a training ground for New York entrepreneur . The most prominent is Kevin Ryan , a former chief executive of DoubleClick . He became a founder of six company , including two e-commerce company , the Gilt Groupe and Zola ; an online business news site , Business Insider ; and a database company , MongoDB .
 Mr. Ryan , the son of a manager at Caterpillar , wa raised in the Midwest and in Europe , when his father wa posted abroad . He majored in economics at Yale , got his M.B.A. at Insead in France , worked on Wall Street and helped develop the Dilbert website in 1995 , a a manager at E. W. Scripps , a medium company .
 The next year , Mr. Ryan jumped into the emerging internet industry , joining DoubleClick a one of the company ’ s first dozen or so employee , initially a chief financial officer and later rising to chief executive . He left DoubleClick in 2005 , two year before Google bought it .
 “ I came to New York because it wa an international city , ” Mr. Ryan said . “ I stayed because I thought it wa going to be a tech city a well . ”
 The latter took a while . Tech investor often suggested he would be better off starting business in Silicon Valley , especially when he and two other DoubleClick alumnus , Dwight Merriman and Eliot Horowitz , founded MongoDB in 2008 . MongoDB , a database maker , grew slowly at first , but it ha proved to be a commercial and financial success . Its stock is trading around $ 100 a share , up from it initial price of $ 24 when it went public in October 2017 . It is now worth more than $ 5 billion .
 Embracing failure a a learning laboratory is another feature of dynamic start-up economy . Mr. Ryan saw that up close with the Gilt Groupe .
 Gilt , an e-commerce site that offered luxury good in online flash sale , raised a lot of money , grew quickly and then fell . In 2016 , Gilt wa sold to Hudson ’ s Bay , parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue , for $ 250 million , le than the venture funding Gilt raised .
 “ We never figured out how to make a profitable business out of flash sale — no one ha , ” said Mr. Ryan , a founder of Gilt . Last year , Gilt wa sold to Rue La La , an e-commerce site , for a fraction of the price Hudson ’ s Bay paid .
 But in 2013 , a group of Gilt alumnus , including Mr. Ryan , took what they had learned and started Zola , a wedding-planning site . Its online gift registry and other service have been used by more than half a million couple , and the start-up raised $ 100 million last May .
 Zola ’ s payroll ha tripled in the last two year , to 155 people , and two-thirds of them are woman . There are team in operation , finance , marketing , merchandising and logistics at it office in Lower Manhattan . Yet the largest single group , about a quarter of the total , is the engineering staff .
 For Zola , New York offer access to the talent and expertise in the city ’ s large fashion , design and retail industry . Its co-founder and chief executive , Shan-Lyn Ma , a Stanford M.B.A. and former product manager at Yahoo , marvel at how much the tech scene ha changed since she moved to the city a decade ago .
 “ The biggest thing is the sheer number of people and the amount of experience people have in tech now , ” Ms. Ma said . “ Now , you just step out onto the street and you hear tech product discussion all the time . ”
 When Maria Samuel graduated from Georgia Institute of Technology with a degree in industrial and system engineering , she wa recruited by Apple and Google . She had been coding since the ninth grade and had worked in seven programming language . As an intern at NASA in Houston , she worked with a team planning Mars mission .
 But Ms. Samuel accepted an offer from Goldman Sachs , joining the investment bank in 2015 .
 A product manager , she work with a team to develop software for market analysis , client communication and trading . She view financial market a a window into industry , market and behavior . “ Every day , I ’ m constantly learning , ” she said .
 After the financial crisis , graduate with computing skill shunned Wall Street for Silicon Valley . But that is no longer the case , a the finance industry is attracting young talent and seasoned technologist . Last year , for example , JPMorgan Chase lured Apoorv Saxena , a senior A.I . product manager at Google , to lead the bank ’ s A.I . product development , and Manuela Veloso from Carnegie Mellon University to head an A.I . research team .
 For Ms. Samuel , 25 , the job wa appealing , but so wa the locale . New York is where many of her friend have come to start their career . And Ms. Samuel , who sang in a choir and an a cappella group in college , describes herself a a “ big Broadway geek . ”
 For most recent graduate , the financial meltdown a decade ago is a distant memory . Today , it is not Wall Street but the big tech company , like Facebook and Google , that are under fire . Their business model , based on gathering consumer data and targeted ad , have put them at the center of global concern about privacy and false news .
 That is a recruiting opportunity these day for R. Martin Chavez , a senior partner at Goldman Sachs , who is also a computer scientist with a Ph.D. from Stanford . At recruiting event , his pitch is to say Google and Facebook have done “ amazing thing ” and quickly add : “ If you want to work on advertising , that ’ s where you should go . If you want to use math and software to solve hard problem for government , corporation and other institution , you should come to Goldman Sachs . ”
 As the New York tech sector grows , policymakers and executive hope to broaden it reach beyond Manhattan and the affluent portion of Brooklyn . Fred Wilson , an investor and venture capitalist in New York for more than three decade , saw a warning sign in the protest in Long Island City , Queens , over the news that Amazon had planned to move in .
 “ That ’ s partly from a sense that it ’ s not going to help them , and only drive up their cost , ” Mr. Wilson said of the community . “ To really be a success in New York , the benefit of the tech sector have to extend to every borough and every neighborhood . ”
 Deborah Estrin wa the first non-Cornell computer scientist to join the Cornell Tech faculty in 2012 . Ms. Estrin wa at the University of California , Los Angeles , and not looking to move . But she read the Cornell Tech proposal , and it emphasis on applied technology resonated .
 Ms. Estrin say that New York ’ s advantage is it concentration of people in other industry working on problem that require technology to solve .
 “ If you ’ re doing pure tech — a superfast chip or advanced system software — Silicon Valley is still the place to be , ” she said . “ But when it come to everything else , New York really ha a chance to be the place to be . ”

 Broadway , Wagner ’ s “ Ring , ” the opening of the Shed : what our critic and writer are looking forward to this season .
 ‘ TOOTSIE ’ What ’ s wrong with musical comedy ? Generally , the music . And the comedy .
 Which may be why most of the best musical of the last decade — “ Fun Home , ” “ Hamilton , ” “ The Band ’ s Visit ” — have been serious indeed . The art of being funny on the beat is mostly a lost one .
 But David Yazbek , the songwriter behind the musical comedy “ Dirty Rotten Scoundrels ” and “ The Full Monty , ” maintains the magic . Even his score for “ The Band ’ s Visit , ” mostly drenched in melancholy , ha moment of lyrical hilarity . Let ’ s just say “ marrow ” and “ pharaoh ” never thought of rhyming until he insisted .
 That ’ s the top reason ( among several ) I have high hope for the stage version of “ Tootsie , ” arriving at the Marquis Theater on March 29 . Based on the 1982 movie about an actor whose stalled career revives only when he pretend to be a woman , it offer both the size and sentiment a musical comedy , in any era , need for liftoff .

 ‘ OKLAHOMA ! ’ What ’ s likely to be the freshest , most revolutionary musical on Broadway this season is more than three-quarters of a century old . Its title is “ Oklahoma ! , ” and , yes , that ’ s the same Rodgers and Hammerstein show about farmer , cowhand and frontier love that wa first seen in New York in 1943 . But the director Daniel Fish ’ s revitalizing interpretation , scheduled to open at the Circle in the Square Theater on April 7 , asks theatergoer to look at a deeply familiar classic through the eye of the 21st century .
 The song , dialogue and character remain almost entirely the same . But a it demonstrated during it sold-out run at St. Ann ’ s Warehouse in Brooklyn last year , Mr. Fish ’ s version find provocative depth of darkness amid the prairie sunshine . BEN BRANTLEY
 ‘ INK ’ The British actor Bertie Carvel , who wore a dress for his Tony-nominated role a the terrifying schoolmistress Miss Trunchbull in the musical “ Matilda ” six year ago , is switching to neatly tailored trouser for his return to Broadway . But don ’ t expect him to be any le intimidating . In James Graham ’ s “ Ink , ” which open in April at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater , Mr. Carvel will be portraying one Rupert Murdoch . And in this London hit about the tabloidization of British journalism , directed by Rupert Goold , any similarity between Mr. Carvel ’ s character and a certain Australian-born medium mogul are definitely not coincidental . BEN BRANTLEY
 ‘ WHAT THE CONSTITUTION MEANS TO ME ’ Heidi Schreck ’ s play about invisible woman and the 14th Amendment wa electrifyingly topical when it ran Off Broadway last year , amid the national outcry over the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh .
 Sadly or fortuitously , “ What the Constitution Means to Me ” is even more urgent a it move to Broadway , where performance begin on March 14 . Its take on abortion a a protected liberty ( and a personal turning point ) come smack up against now-Justice Kavanaugh , who signaled , in one of his first opinion , a willingness to reverse Roe v. Wade .
 But the play is deeper than it timeliness suggests . Though it us the idea of debate a a touchstone — and end , deliciously , with a live one — it ’ s really about how we come to question our most bedrock assumption about the world . If that make seeing it almost a civic duty , duty ha rarely been so pleasurable . JESSE GREEN
 ‘ THE LEHMAN TRILOGY ’ Three Bavarian-born brother who first set foot on American soil more than 150 year ago are returning to New York next month , accompanied by a centuries-spanning brood of their descendant . Their name are Henry , Emanuel and Mayer , and they — and their seemingly countless kin — will be reincarnated at the Park Avenue Armory in Stefano Massini ’ s “ The Lehman Trilogy , ” an epic tale of financial rise and ruin , directed by Sam Mendes .
 This three-hours-plus production feature what is surely the largest cast of character of any play in town . Yet they are embodied by a mere three , seemingly inexhaustible actor with the power to multiply themselves like amoeba : Simon Russell Beale , Ben Miles and Adam Godley . Though the story they tell — which begin and end with the world-rocking bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008 — is one of entropy , the play in which they appear promise to be a resounding testament to the regenerative power of theater .
 As befits a sprawling , globe-girdling story of historic transformation , “ The Lehman Brothers ” ha an intricate , multinational pedigree . Mr. Massini ’ s chronicle of a dynasty begun by emigrant to the United States began life a an Italian radio play before making it stage debut in Paris ( in French ) in 2013 . Its Italian premiere wa at the fabled Piccolo Teatro in Milan two year later , when it ran a whopping five hour .
 Ben Power ’ s English-language adaptation opened at the National Theater in London last summer , overseen by Mr. Mendes , the very busy stage and film director whose gripping production of Jez Butterworth ’ s “ The Ferryman ” is a current hit on Broadway . Mr. Power pared Mr. Massini ’ s trilogy to a sleek and unexpectedly lyrical three hour ( not counting two intermission ) to be performed almost entirely by three actor on an elegant but nearly empty rotating set ( by the ever-inventive Es Devlin ) .
 Otherwise , empty is hardly a word to be applied to this interpretation , a I can attest from seeing it at the National last July . Mr. Beale , Mr . Miles and Mr. Godley fill the stage to repletion , a they assume the varied form of the dynasty-founding Henry , Emanuel and Mayer — and all subsequent generation of Lehmans .
 And their friend , lover , spouse , customer , rival , ad infinitum , with a variety that continually astonishes . Unlike investor who lost their fortune on Wall Street a decade ago , no one who leaf this encounter with the brother Lehman is likely to walk away feeling poor . BEN BRANTLEY
 ‘ MARYS SEACOLE ’ Born in 1805 to a free Jamaican mother and a Scottish father , Mary Seacole grew up to become an international businesswoman and freelance nurse , crossing path with soldier , royalty and Florence Nightingale .
 That would be more than enough material for a straight-ahead bio-drama — but not , it seems , for the always surprising and formally ingenious Jackie Sibblies Drury , whose “ Fairview ” wa one of last year ’ s best play . In the deliberately plural “ Marys Seacole , ” playing through March 24 at LCT3 ’ s Claire Tow Theater , everyone in the six-woman cast is a Mary — or a Merry , a Miriam , a Mamie or the like .
 The indispensable Quincy Tyler Bernstine appears a the historical Mrs. Seacole in this production directed by Lileana Blain-Cruz . The others , whose character cross continent and time , help raise a central question of nursing even now : Who take care of the people who take care of others ? JESSE GREEN
 ‘ WHITE NOISE ’ No American playwright ha contributed more to the churning and ever-evolving conversation about race in these United ( and divided ) States than Suzan-Lori Parks . This prodigiously imaginative writer , who won a Pulitzer Prize for “ Topdog/Underdog , ” ha addressed the toxic legacy of slavery in a rich assortment of theatrical form and language , from the surrealism of her early “ The America Play ” to the Homeric chronicle “ Father Comes Home From the Wars . ”
 Now Ms . Parks is focusing her gaze on interracial friendship in the 21st century with the resonantly titled “ White Noise , ” which begin preview next month at her longtime home , the Public Theater . Oskar Eustis , the Public ’ s artistic director , oversees a four-member cast , led by Daveed Diggs ( the original Marquis de Lafayette in “ Hamilton ” ) a an African-American man forced to reconsider the depth and danger of the gap between black and white . BEN BRANTLEY
 ‘ MRS . MURRAY ’ S MENAGERIE ’ I ’ m not sure anyone could have imagined a duller setting for a play than a high school faculty meeting , yet in “ Miles for Mary , ” the theatrical collective called the Mad Ones turned the banality of the break room into a hilarious and ultimately galvanizing Off Broadway hit .
 As if to top themselves , the Mad Ones return this spring with “ Mrs . Murray ’ s Menagerie , ” set in ( a ) the 1970s ; at ( b ) a focus group ; for ( c ) a child ’ s television show . That is all we know , and all we need to know .
 Except that the Ars Nova production , which begin performance on March 26 at the Greenwich House Theater , feature a cast of expertly light-touch farceurs under the direction of Lila Neugebauer , who made “ Miles for Mary ” so moving behind the laugh . If this is banality , let ’ s have more ! JESSE GREEN
 THE ‘ RING ’ The Metropolitan Opera ’ s high-tech , low-energy production of Wagner ’ s four-opera “ Ring , ” which return for three cycle this spring , ha been notable mostly for it snafu . At it first performance — “ Das Rheingold , ” back in 2010 — the set ’ s massive array of seesaw malfunctioned near the end , spoiling the god ’ climactic ascent across a rainbow bridge .
 Another time , the Microsoft Windows logo flashed across the stage instead of the sophisticated projection that distinguish the cycle ’ s many locale . One performance of “ Die Walküre ” that wa being broadcast live to cinema worldwide wa delayed nearly an hour because the “ Machine , ” a it became known , wouldn ’ t cooperate . And that ’ s not counting the loud creak and whir that accompanied it every move .
 But while the Met claim that the costly Machine — conceived by the production ’ s director , Robert Lepage — ha been tamed , the technical trouble always struck me a distraction from the real problem . All of Mr. Lepage ’ s spending and innovation resulted in a cycle that wa dull , and out of touch with Wagner ’ s intricately drawn character and plot .
 The singer seemed genuinely undirected , lost in front of the set ’ s imposing mass ; the production team wa scrambling to make the effect work , but it appeared that relatively little attention had been given to the acting . There were no discernible relationship charted onstage , no drama , no attempt to transmit — let alone interpret for our time — complex theme of power , sacrifice and societal collapse .
 Indeed , though the set design meant that some singer spent long stretch in a kind of trough , the effect , while wonky , may have been the best part . At the beginning of “ Das Rheingold , ” bathed in blue light , the 20 enormous plank levitated in silence . Wagner ’ s long , low E flat began . Then , like the music , the machine began undulating — first slowly , then faster . It truly wa the river Rhine .
 The opening storm of “ Die Walküre ” similarly came to life : We were in a sky full of dark , rushing cloud ; then in the middle of a forest during a snowstorm ; then inside a hut glowing with firelight . It wa sweeping and evocative .
 A production crowded with visual stimulation , in which the singer seemed to be left to their own device ? This “ Ring ” reminded me , more than it probably intended to , of the Met ’ s hyper-realistic Franco Zeffirelli spectacle of the 1980s . Like Mr. Lepage , Mr. Zeffirelli creates grand space in which stick figure are moved around . The show ignite when you have compelling performer and sink when you don ’ t .
 This revival — which Peter Gelb , the Met ’ s general manger , is mounting after many thought the Machine , last seen in 2013 , would be mothballed for good — doe indeed have some compelling casting . Christine Goerke , a Brünnhilde , promise more vocal confidence than Deborah Voigt had when the production wa new ; Greer Grimsley and Michael Volle will each make a capable , articulate Wotan ; Philippe Jordan return to the Met for the first time since 2007 to conduct .
 Things may well go more smoothly this time around . But will this yet be a Wagner we can believe in ? ZACHARY WOOLFE
 ‘ PRISONER OF THE STATE ’ “ How he mocked me , ” a villainous official lament , explaining why he locked away the political prisoner he now want killed . That chilling line ring out in “ prisoner of the state , ” the new David Lang opera that reimagines Beethoven ’ s only opera , “ Fidelio ” ; the New York Philharmonic will give it premiere on June 6.Beethoven ’ s theme feel a resonant a ever in a country grappling with question about mass incarceration ; immigrant separated from their child at the border ; whether the president is answerable to the law ; and how inmate were quietly kept without heat or light for day in a federal jail in the middle of New York City .
 The opera , directed by Elkhanah Pulitzer , will serve a the finale of Jaap van Zweden ’ s first season a the Philharmonic ’ s music director , and he will conduct a cast that includes the moving bass-baritone Eric Owens . MICHAEL COOPER
 ECSTATIC MUSIC FESTIVAL Among it other skill , the Bang on a Can organization
 is smart about fund-raising . By soliciting fan to help them commission new work , the collective ensures a reliably expanding repertory for it in-house chamber ensemble , the Bang on a Can All-Stars .
 The latest batch of these “ People ’ s Commissioning Fund ” piece come to the Ecstatic Music Festival at Merkin Concert Hall on March 6 . Fresh music by Nicole Lizée and Pulitzer Prize-winner Henry Threadgill will share a bill with vintage work by Annie Gosfield and Glenn Branca , who died last year . The evening ’ s theme is music for dancing , which Mr. Threadgill ha previously explored with his Society Situation Dance Band .

 MITSUKO UCHIDA It ’ s easy to forget that the piano is a percussion instrument when it ’ s played by Mitsuko Uchida . She animates it with both symphonic might and enchanting lyricism — a perfect fit for the vast emotional range and singing melody of Schubert . Ms. Uchida recorded one of the finest cycle of Schubert ’ ssonatas , and she ha been revisiting portion , the late work , in a survey at Carnegie Hall . That come to an end this spring , with two recital on April 30 and May 4 .
 Endings are very much part of both program . They are almost stage of grief : The Sonata No . 20 in A ( D. 959 ) contains an abruptly tumultuous passage , like a petulant tantrum , then the heart-rending Sonata No . 21 in B flat ( D. 960 ) offer bittersweet acceptance . JOSHUA BARONE
 THE SHED The Shed ha a modest name and enormous ambition .
 Opening April 5 , it ’ s the cultural component of the gigantic Hudson Yards development on the West Side of Manhattan : an eight-story structure that includes gallery ; rehearsal space ; a theater that can adapt to seated or standing-room event ; and a shell that can enclose an adjacent plaza into a performance space .
 Its mandate is to commission and present world premiere of new and innovative work , and it artistic director and chief executive , Alex Poots , arrives after a decade a the artistic director of the Manchester International Festival in Britain and , in recent year , of the Park Avenue Armory in New York City .
 The Shed ’ s first full-scale offering celebrates the heritage and scope of African-American music . Over five night from April 5-14 , “ Soundtrack of America ” set out to explore a “ family tree ” of American music , from spiritual to hip-hop , with a lineup of 25 young performer to bring out continuity and breakthrough .
 “ Soundtrack of America ” arrives with unquestioned credential . The series is conceived and directed by the filmmaker and video artist Steve McQueen , whose “ 12 Years a Slave ” won the Oscar for best picture in 2014 . His brain trust includes the illustrious producer Quincy Jones ; the crate-digging hip-producer No I.D . ( a.k.a . Dion Wilson ) ; and the keyboardist Greg Phillinganes , who wa Michael Jackson ’ s musical director and ha worked with Stevie Wonder , Eric Clapton and Bruno Mars .
 The performer announced so far — five each night — include 2019 Grammy winner like Fantastic Negrito and PJ Morton ; the genre-meshing New Orleans band Tank and the Bangas ; Judith Hill , who sang backup for Prince and Michael Jackson , among many others ; the rapper and singer Smino ; the eerily idiosyncratic , falsetto-loving songwriter Moses Sumney and serpentwithfeet ; and Jon Batiste , who lead the band Stay Human on “ The Late Show With Stephen Colbert. ” The African-American musical family tree give them a boundless source of potential material .
 The Shed ha also announced another major musical production , May 6-June 1 : a premiere from Björk , who introduced her “ Biophilia ” in 2011 at the Manchester International Festival . Björk describes it a “ my most elaborate stage concert yet , where the acoustic and digital will shake hand ” ; her backup includes a seven-woman Icelandic flute ensemble . The title , promisingly , is “ Cornucopia. ” JON PARELES
 ROBYN A Robyn show is a bit different from other pop concert . It isn ’ t an over-the-top spectacle of rotating set piece and wardrobe change , or a showcase of vocal acrobatics and choreographed backup dancer .
 It is sweaty and straight-up — pop church and pop group therapy , a place for fan of the Swedish singer and songwriter , who first hit the United States in the late 1990s , to experience Robyn ’ s transcendent , deeply addictive music beside her .
 From February to April , including a stop at Madison Square Garden in New York on March 8 , she ’ s touring to support “ Honey , ” her first full album in eight year , which came after a half-decade of psychoanalysis and a series of personal challenge . Her loyal listener have been anxiously waiting to share their euphoria and pain . CARYN GANZ
 MASSIVE ATTACK In 1998 , the British trip-hop trio Massive Attack unleashed it third album , “ Mezzanine , ” a brooding , sensual , chilly , paranoid record of sputtering groove and gauzy atmospherics that wound it way into popular culture everywhere , from “ The Matrix ” to the TV show “ House . ”
 The band ha released two more album in the 21 year since , but the gravitational pull of “ Mezzanine ” remains potent , and the group — now a duo consisting of Robert del Naja ( known a 3D ) and Grant Marshall ( Daddy G ) — is playing a series of show marking it ( belated ) 20th anniversary . The brief tour , which hit Boston on March 14 and wrap in San Diego on April 2 , promise to be an enveloping , dynamic visual extravaganza . CARYN GANZ
 BIG EARS FESTIVAL The Big Ears Festival in Knoxville , Tenn. , ha become a point of pilgrimage for all sort of experimental listener : Indie classical , avant-garde jazz , ambient electronic music and post-rock are all well accounted for here .
 The festival will celebrate it 10th anniversary , March 21-24 , overtaking nearly a dozen space across the city ’ s downtown . All are within walking distance of each other , but each is comfortable and acoustically sound enough that you ’ ll forget what you ’ re missing a few door down .

 MERCE CUNNINGHAM Merce Cunningham , that marvel of a choreographer , understood that dancing meant different thing to different people . In the book “ Merce Cunningham : Fifty Years , ” he is quoted a saying : “ What to some is splendid entertainment , to others is merely tedium and fidget ; what to some seems barren , to others is the very essence of the heroic . ”
 His entire career wa a heroic act of vision and persistence . One of the most revered and revolutionary choreographer of the 20th century , Cunningham wa a rule breaker who collaborated deeply with many artist , including his life partner , the composer John Cage . Their experiment involved allowing music and dance to exist separately , a well a introducing the concept of chance a a creative device .
 In 2019 , the year of his centennial , Cunningham — who died at 90 in 2009 — is being celebrated all over the world with performance , workshop , talk , screening and more .
 “ The idea are still very much alive and relevant and exciting and creative , ” Ken Tabachnick , the executive director of the Merce Cunningham Trust , said . “ Every time I see something again , I ’ m just amazed at how relevant it is . It could have been made yesterday . ”
 That is one of the important point that Mr. Tabachnick and Trevor Carlson — a trustee and the producer of the Trust ’ s celebration of the centennial — hope to impart with the multi-tentacled celebration . Events continue all year and are updated on the Trust ’ s website , but one highlight is just around the corner : “ Night of 100 Solos : A Centennial Event , ” on April 16 , Cunningham ’ s birthday .
 Three city — London ( at the Barbican ) , New York ( at the Brooklyn Academy of Music ) and Los Angeles ( at the Center for the Art of Performance at U.C.L.A . ) — will stage Events , the name that Cunningham gave to performance that featured fragment of work from his repertory . ( Events date to 1964 . )
 “ We ’ re looking to continue Merce ’ s tradition of doing thing that hadn ’ t been done before , ” Mr. Carlson said . “ We wanted to make the largest Event ever made . ”
 In the spirit of the new , none of the performer — including the New York City Ballet principal Sara Mearns , the Martha Graham dancer PeiJu Chien-Pott and the choreographer Kyle Abraham and Vicky Shick — are former Cunningham dancer . Those dancer are involved , however , in staging the solo . ( Cunningham ’ s company , according to his wish , disbanded after his death and a legacy tour . )
 “ We wanted to signal that the Cunningham legacy ha a future for people who never experienced Cunningham , ” Mr. Tabachnick said . “ So you ’ ll see ballet dancer , you ’ ll see dancer who are not classically or rigorously trained , you ’ ll see younger dancer and older dancer . And that is to show the diversity and breadth of the possibility for the legacy . ”
 Events are piling up , and include a Cunningham celebration at the Joyce Theater ( April 17-21 ) featuring Compagnie CNDC-Angers/Robert Swinston , Ballet West and the Washington Ballet . Amid the excitement , Mr. Carlson ha a problem . It ’ s a good one .
 “ It ’ s wild , but I ’ m afraid we might have to expand the amount of time of the centennial in order to include everyone who want to be included , ” he said . “ I think we ’ re going to see ourselves extending to what would have been Merce ’ s 101st birthday. ” GIA KOURLAS
 DANCE THEATER OF HARLEM Dance Theater of Harlem ha never been just another ballet troupe . It wa created , in 1969 , a a hopeful reaction to hope-crushing circumstance . The assassination of the Rev . Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. wa among the spur to action , but the principal problem in need of addressing wa longstanding and continuing : the dearth of opportunity for ballet dancer who were not white . “ You can ’ t do this , ” these dancer were told by the world in many way . Dance Theater of Harlem told them they could , and then proved it to the world .
 The survival of this institution for 50 year deserves a big celebration . With the death of it trailblazing founding director , Arthur Mitchell , in September , the anniversary festivity have also become memorial . In recent decade the company ha valiantly struggled with diminished fund , and it New York season at City Center ( April 10 , 12-13 ) isn ’ t a grand a one might wish . Such signature piece a “ Agon , ” “ Firebird ” and “ Creole Giselle ” return only in excerpt . But it ’ s appropriate that one of Mr. Mitchell ’ s work ( “ Tones ” ) is being revived , and Robert Garland , the troupe ’ s underrecognized resident choreographer , is presenting a premiere . However these turn out , the occasion is major . BRIAN SEIBERT
 PAM TANOWITZ When Emma Portner , known for her video dance , withdrew from a New York City Ballet commission , the company turned to Pam Tanowitz . The circumstance are hardly ideal , but here ’ s a one-word reaction : Finally .
 Ms. Tanowitz , whose new ballet will be unveiled at the company ’ s spring gala on May 2 , ha been making dance since 1992 . Celebrated for her ability to mix classical and contemporary vocabulary within a framework of formal structure , she will expand a piece set to Bartok ’ s String Quartet No . 5 that she created during a choreographic workshop at American Ballet Theater in 2017 .
 It ’ s not the prolific Ms. Tanowitz ’ s only new dance this season : In April , she present a work at the Martha Graham Dance Company ; another commission , from Paul Taylor American Modern Dance , will have it premiere at the Orchestra of St. Luke ’ s Bach Festival in June , the same month she present a new work for her company and the City Ballet dancer Sara Mearns and Taylor Stanley at the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council ’ s River to River Festival .
 And on March 22 , she will land in Cleveland to stage a site-specific work at Pilgrim Congregational Church for her company along with local dancer . “ Recital # 1 ( five small dance for Cleveland ) ” is an experiment : She ’ s looking at way to reimagine her repertory . GIA KOURLAS
 LIGIA LEWIS Every so often , New Yorkers catch a glimpse of the choreographer Ligia Lewis , who spends much of her time in Berlin . Her brief visit , which in recent year have been high point of the American Realness festival , are not to be missed .
 Capping the refusal-themed “ No Series ” at Performance Space New York , Ms. Lewis will present “ minor matter ” and “ Water Will ( in Melody ) , ” two part of a triptych that began in 2014 with the spare and piercing “ Sorrow Swag. ” Each work in the trilogy corresponds to a color , teasing out it association : blue , red and white . ( “ Sorrow Swag ” featured a lone male performer enveloped in blue light . )
 First seen in New York at Abrons Arts Center , where three indefatigable dancer ( Ms. Lewis included ) seemed almost to topple the theater wall , “ minor matter ” ( red ) return May 21-22 . Exploring the space between love and rage — and the relationship between blackness and the black-box theater — it stage a kind of tangled collective struggle , in which the people onstage could be conspiring with or against one another , maybe both at once . The final part , “ Water Will ( in Melody ) , ” May 28-29 , flirt with melodrama and catastrophe , which sound like a fitting end . SIOBHAN BURKE

 Ghosts ! Billygoats ! Lazy men and thirsty thief ! All these story — and more like them — a they were dutifully reported in the late 1800s and early 1900s .
 The headline you ’ ll see below are bizarre . But the article , all of which once appeared in the page of The New York Times , are even more so .
 Did a ghost really express itself by moving a box of macaroni one day in 1898 ? How did a dog learn to ask for cake in German ? And what brought on The Times ’ s obsession with the Loch Ness monster ?
 All these story — and more like them — were dutifully reported , mostly in the late 1800s and early 1900s .
 The most head-spinning story are the one about ghost , poltergeist and sea serpent . Perhaps not surprisingly , the paranormal story appear at the end of the 19th century , when the Spiritualist movement wa strong . ( There were article about ghost riding bicycle , stealing bread , eating apple pie and playing the flute , for starter . )
 Stories of animal abounded , too . Dogs and cat , of course , were well-represented ; but unusual pet — monkey , beaver , bear , raccoon , squirrel , hummingbird , crane and the like — made the page often . Also popular were workaday crime story ; the cheekier and more brazen the criminal were , the more newsprint they got .
 It wa a distinct era of news reporting , in topic a well a tone : Readers of the current iteration of The Times might find some obvious difference in how people and event are described . ( We ’ ve also preserved the original typo . )
 Below is a selection of those fantastical , amusing tale .

 Commuter Carried Victim and Guilty Secret to New York .
 EAST ORANGE , N.J. , Feb. 6 . — A New York business man who life in East Orange and is something of a pigeon fancier recently lost several of his finest bird through the depredation of vagrant cat . A few day ago the loss became so heavy that he armed himself with a gun and lay in ambush one afternoon when he returned from the city .
 After a wait he saw a lean cat emerge from the cote with one of his finest pigeon in it mouth . He fired , and the cat fell dead . In the early transport of his joy at having destroyed the thief he forgot that there wa yet a task for him to perform , but soon recollected that the body must be disposed of . First he thought of digging a hole in the back yard and interring the cat therein , but then he trembled when he thought what the neighbor might think he wa burying . At last a bright idea struck him .
 “ I ’ ll wrap the cat in paper and throw it off the ferryboat when I cross in the morning , ” he promised himself .
 So , with the bundle neatly tied , he took the train on the following morning . He got off the train and boarded the boat , and there he wa greeted by a group of friend from whom he could not escape . He reflected that he might have to make embarrassing explanation if he threw the bundle overboard while he wa with them , and he deferred the act until the boat landed , thinking he could easily cast it away in an ash barrel on the way to the office .
 He passed several ash barrel on his way , but somehow or other some one always seemed to be gazing in his direction when he approached one , and once or twice he saw a watchful policeman . He recollected how unpleasant discovery had been made in ash barrel , and he didn ’ t want to be arrested on suspicion . So he went all the way to the office and carefully locked the body in a closet , reflecting he could throw it overboard on his way home .
 Going across the river that night he met some more sociable acquaintance , and the cat boarded the train with him a a result . He laid the package down beside him and tried to become absorbed in his paper , but that everlasting cat haunted him . When he reached his station he picked up a package and went home . Reaching there , he handed the bundle to the cook and , a indifferently a he could , told her to bury the cat in the back yard .
 “ Yes , Sir , ” said the woman .
 There were a few minute of relief for the East Orangeite , but soon the cook reappeared .
 “ I guess there ’ s some mistake , Sir . This isn ’ t a cat in the paper . It ’ s a nice leg of mutton . ”
 The man had evidently picked up the wrong bundle on leaving the train , and he only hope the other fellow who reached home with the dead cat doesn ’ t learn his identity .

 BROOKHAVEN , L. I. , Aug. 21 . — Mrs. Edward Raynor ’ s pet turtle , which came to her back door every day in Spring and Summer for four year to get pancake made by a recipe known to her family for 200 year , ha been kidnapped and advertised a lost in the current issue of The Brookhaven Advance .
 Mrs. Raynor , like many other person of Brookhaven , ha made a pet of turtle , especially those which had the initial of her ancestor carved on their shell , and when this particular turtle which had a large “ B ” on his back , came to her house four year ago , she knew he had been the pet of the Bartow family , her ancestor , who settled here two century ago , and she took pain to make him welcome .
 The turtle , a large fellow , immediately showed a fondness for the Bartow pancake . At first he ate only what the Raynor cat left , but then , after Mrs. Raynor saw how much he liked them , she made up special batch of batter for him alone and set them out in a plate at the back door . Every morning he would waddle to the house to get them , except during strawberry blossom time , when Mrs. Raynor knew he wa getting sustenance in strawberry bed .
 This would continue until early Fall , when , with the first cold snap , the turtle would disappear somewhere into the earth to hibernate for the Winter .
 But a week or so ago after the turtle had got his pancake and waddled off again to whatever turtle do when not eating pancake , Mrs. Raynor saw an automobile stop , a man reach down to the earth , lift something into his car and drive away .
 The next day and the next , and the day afterward the turtle did not come to the Raynor backdoor for his pancake . Then Mrs. Raynor inserted the following advertisement in The Brookhaven Advance :
 LOST — If this notice come to the man who took the turtle , will he please return him to Mrs. Edward Raynor , who fear he will miss his pancake and also will never be able to find his way back to his Winter location ?
 “ I want only to know that the turtle is well off , ” said Mrs. Raynor today . “ If the man doesn ’ t want to return him , I ’ ll be glad to send him a recipe for the pancake . I ’ m afraid the turtle will miss them and be unhappy . ”

 Then Valente Learned He Had Buried the Wrong Woman .
 Insists That Morgue Keeper Persuaded Him Against His Judgment a to Identity of Body .
 Declaring that the city falsely notified him that his wife wa dead , and saddled him with the expense of a funeral for a strange woman , Ignacio Valente , who life at 311 East Sixteenth Street , ha filed a bill for $ 250 against the city . The auditing bureau of the Finance Department now ha it in charge .
 Valente is an Italian , and about six week ago he quarreled with his wife , Angelico , over the way she cooked macaroni . As a result of the quarrel the wife left Valente ’ s home , declaring she would rather die than return . When Valente ’ s rage had cooled he became worried over his wife and started a search for her , reporting her loss to the police . He gave a careful description of the woman , and finally , on being notified that the body of a woman answering the description wa at the Morgue , he went there , accompanied by his two-year-old daughter . He identified the clothing of the dead woman a belonging to his wife , but when shown the body , said he declared it had been changed .
 “ They all change after death , ” he say the Morgue keeper declared .
 “ This woman wa better looking than my wife , ” Valente say he declared .
 “ Death beautifies them all , ” the Morgue man is said to have replied .
 Smothering his doubt , Valente say he had the body brought to his home , and then , in response to an old request made by his wife , got out the wedding dress used by Mrs. Valente and had the strange woman attired in it . The funeral wa held and Valente footed the bill , he declared .
 Notice of the event wa published in the Italian paper , and the real Mrs. Valente , reading it , started poste haste for her home . Valente , on arriving home , discovered the real Mrs. Valente rummaging about for her wedding dress .
 “ What ha become of it ? ” she demanded , when Valente entered .
 “ Why , I buried you in it three day ago , ” Valente , in his surprise , replied .
 Real trouble followed this , and , when Valente had satisfied himself it wa his real wife who stood before him , and that he had buried the wrong woman , he could only restore peace by promising to buy his wife another wedding dress just like the one in which the strange woman had been buried .
 Now he demand that the city pay him $ 100 which he spent for the funeral of the wrong woman , $ 40 for wage lost through grief and because of illness that followed the shock of finding his wife alive , and $ 110 for the bridal costume which he had placed on the corpse , and with which sum he desire to buy a new gown for the real Mrs. Valente . He asserts that he never would have accepted the body of the of the other woman , whose identity still is unknown , unless the Morgue keeper had forced him to believe that it wa the body of his wife .

 At Last Killed His Owner by Tearing Off Burner While She Slept .
 WASHINGTON , Sept. 13 — Alice Knott , twenty-three year old , of 803 Twelfth Street , came to her death yesterday through the instrumentality of her pet parrot , an evil-dispositioned bird , who wa cordially detested by everybody except his mistress , but who seemed to have a strong affection for her . He would follow her from room to room , and wa never happy except in her presence . He wa generally regarded a a devil by the negro and a a bird of ill-omen by the white . His unpopularity wa increased by an uncanny habit of pulling the tip off the gas burner with his strong beak and inhaling the gas until it stupefied him . He wa a gas fiend , a feathered victim of the gas habit .
 While his young mistress wa sleeping yesterday the parrot took off the lava tip in her room and started on a gas debauch . This time there wa no one near to avert the consequence of his deed . When Miss Knott ’ s relative , alarmed by her long silence , broke open the door they found her dead . Her little murderer wa found half-unconscious by the door . When he found himself succumbing to the gas and wa not rescued a usual by his mistress , he realized that something wa wrong , and had wit or instinct enough to make for the door and shove his bill a far a he could underneath it . He recovered , and while the Coroner wa in the house the malignant little bird wa caught trying to turn on the gas again .

 It Has Returned for Its Hand , Which Mr. Norton Dug Up .
 The old town of Flatbush , now the Twenty-ninth Ward of Brooklyn , ha a ghost , a Simon-Pure , sure-enough ghost , that nightly walk on East Broadway , near Nostrand Avenue , and stop at the house of Charles Norton to make inquiry for a hand that it lost there many year ago while it restless spirit wa in the flesh . These visit are not fully appreciated by Norton or his wife , but it appears that Norton is to blame for the appearance of this ghost , because his ghostship wa not heard of until Norton , while searching for gold in his cellar , dug up a hand that had lain undisturbed for year .
 There wa a ring on one of the finger of the exhumed hand , and when this had been rubbed the ghost , in true Arabian Nights fashion , appeared , and a it failed to get instruction from Norton , it is now said that all it want is the hand and ring and that thereafter it will cease worrying the descendant of the early Dutch in Flatbush .
 The story that the old Dutchmen in the town tell of the ghost is that sixty year ago a belated traveler , with lot of gold in his belt , staid over night at the farmhouse of one Krug , a thrifty Dutch farmer .
 Krug , when he heard of the large amount of gold that his visitor had about him , gave up his own room to the stranger and insisted that he should occupy it . The next day the visitor had disappeared , and when the family asked Krug about it he said the man had departed before daybreak . The bedclothing wa also missing , and Krug accounted for this by saying he had burned it , because the stranger had just recovered from an attack of yellow fever .
 Subsequently a man ’ s hand wa found behind the bed . It had been cut off by Krug with an axe , it is said . When the hand wa found , Krug disappeared , and the hand wa buried .
 Mrs. Norton , in speaking of this ghost and it uncanny visit , said the house wa haunted , and continued :
 “ Everybody who ha lived here since murder wa done under this roof ha had bad luck . One man who occupied the house about forty year ago left his wife and child and ran away with another man ’ s wife ; another wa a burglar , and when he wa caught a whole lot of silverware wa found buried in the cellar ; another committed suicide . We ’ ve been here for six year now , and there ha been nothing but sickness in our family . I don ’ t like to talk about these thing — it sends a chill down my back . ”
 Norton , while hunting for the silverware supposed to be buried in his cellar , dug up two rusty Revolutionary sword and several piece of ancient coin before the hand wa unearthed .

 Mr. Heap learned that Mrs. Harris , in desperation , had told her little boy that there wa no Santa Claus for poor child . He rose from his bed and in his automobile drove to the shopping district , where he himself made the selection of gift for the family . The automobile could not penetrate the deep drift of snow in the lower part of town , so Mr. Heap , staggering under his burden , walked to the Harris door , two block away . Leaving the gift with the mother , he said :

 A violent coughing spell seized the philanthropist , who wa half carried to his motor car by Mrs. Harris . He wa hurried home and specialist were summoned , but it wa too late . He wa dead .

 “ Charles R. Johnson , Bangor , Me. , ” registered at Jaeger ’ s Hotel , 561 Seventh Avenue , early in September .
 “ Will you have dinner , Mr. Johnson ? ” the clerk asked .
 “ Yes : send some pickle to my room . ”
 Later in the day the new guest ordered a course supper , two course of pickle and one of cracker .
 Johnson remained in the place until yesterday , eating nothing except cracker and pickle . He had frequent conference with the cook , who wa the only person about the hotel whom he would notice .
 Johnson went to the cook yesterday morning , telling him he had a new receipt for pickle which he desired to have made up . Opening his shirt Johnson disclosed a wallet hanging about his neck by a ribbon . Around it tape wa rolled , the end being held in place by red wax seal . These Johnson broke , and from the wallet he took a paper and began to read :
 Take some cucumbersWhen quite green , From the gardenWhile unseen.Soak them longIn salt mush.Add your spices.Watch them rust.For same daysLet them lie ; Take them out.In slice fry.That ’ s a dishWhich one sings ; So good it is , Is fit for Kings .
 “ Why , that ’ s nothing but ordinary pickle fried , ” the cook told him .
 At this Johnson became angry , and retired to his room . To the proprietor went the cook .
 “ He ’ s that crazy , ” said the cook , “ that he want to spoil good pickle by frying them . ”
 The proprietor spoke to the policeman on post , Baxter , of the Tenderloin Station House . A Bellevue Hospital ambulance later took Johnson away , on the ground that he wa afflicted with dementia . For a time he wa unwilling to go , inquiring defiantly :
 “ Got any pickle over there ? ”
 “ Whole vat of them , ” he wa told .
 Johnson climbed hastily into the ambulance .

 He ’ s a Setter and Demands Cakes in Good German , It Is Asserted .
 BERLIN , Nov. 19 — The scientific sensation of the hour in Germany is the talking dog Don , a dark-brown setter belonging to a royal gamekeeper named Ebers at Thiershütte , near Hamburg . Don promise to become a celebrated an attraction a the horse Clever Hans , which startled the zoological savant of Europe eight year ago with his alleged mathematical feat .
 Karl Hagenbeck , the world-famed animal dealer , ha offered Don ’ s master $ 2,500 for the privilege of exhibiting the dog in the Hagenbeck outdoor menagerie at Hamburg . The dog ’ s vocabulary , it is said , already embrace six word .
 His alleged elocutionary power came to light early this week a the result of report from the United States that Prof. Alexander Graham Bell had succeeded in teaching a terrier to speak . It wa declared that Germany not only possessed a dog with similar gift but a dog which had been talking for five year , in fact , ever since he wa six month old .
 The story wa first considered a joke , but Thiershütte all the week ha been the Mecca of interested inquirer , who have come away convinced that Don is a genuine canine wonder . His caller included a number of newspaper men , who went to Thiershütte to interview the dog . The gamekeeper , Ebers , affirms that the dog began talking in 1905 without training of any kind . According to his owner , the animal sauntered up one day to the table where the family were eating , and , when his master asked , “ You want something , don ’ t you ? ” he stupefied the family by replying in a deep masculine tone , “ Haben , haben. ” ( “ Want , want. ” ) The tone wa not a bark or growl , it is declared , but distinct speech , and increased in plainness from day to day a his master took more interest in the dog ’ s newly discovered talent .
 Shortly afterward , the story go , the dog learned to say “ Hunger ” when asked what he had . Then he wa taught to say “ Küchen , ” ( cake , ) and finally “ Ja ” and “ Nein. ” And it is added that he is now able to string several of these word together in sensible rotation and will say “ Hunger , I want cake , ” when an appropriate question is addressed to him .
 The New York Times correspondent ha caused inquiry regarding Don to be made through trustworthy authority at Hamburg . He is assured that the dog is an unqualified scientific marvel .
 Don ’ s owner is overwhelmed with application from circus and music-hall manager , who are outbidding one another for the privilege of exhibiting the dog .

 Prayers Will Be Said To-day to Lay a Restless West Orange Spirit .
 ORANGE , N. J . — Prayers will be said to-morrow morning in the Church of St. Michael the Archangel , in Matthews Street , this city , to lay a ghost which is driving the Italian resident of White Street , West Orange , into superstitious frenzy .
 Ghostly rappings , hand-clappings , and other supernatural demonstration have been heard and experienced since Monday in the store and room occupied by Frank Petro and family , who keep a grocery store in one end of a big frame tenement house just across the Orange line . It wa in this house that Peter Christiano wa stabbed by Lorenzo Corbo , an old organ grinder , at a New Year ’ s Eve party eight month ago . The neighbor assert that the ghostly demonstration are caused by the restless spirit of the murdered man .
 Father d ’ Aquilla , pastor of the Church of St. Michael , wa called in last night . He prayed and sprinkled holy water in the room where the noise were heard . While he wa in the house there were no demonstration , but a soon a he had left , the family and neighbor aver , the noise were recommenced with redoubled frequency and violence .
 Petro , who is a big , hearty man of intelligent appearance , say he doe not believe in ghost , but doe not know what else to think . At midnight last night , he declares , he heard a noise a if the front door of his store , which were fastened with a heavy bar set in staple , had been thrown wide open and the bar flung to the floor . He tried to get out of bed to investigate , but wa held down by some invisible power , which pressed upon his chest and made it impossible for him to move . The “ presence ” remained for an hour , he say . The store door were locked a usual this morning , but a box of macaroni , which had been placed upon a top shelf , stood on the floor in the middle of the room , with a handful of long straw lying across the top in the form of a cross .
 A Times correspondent heard the noise to-night and made a thorough investigation of the room and cellar without ascertaining their cause . Samuel Christiano , a brother of the murdered man , who keep a saloon on the next block , is convinced that the “ presence ” is that of his brother ’ s spirit . He say he went last night into the room where most of the noise are heard and begged the spirit to make itself visible . It did not , but a he rose from his knee after praying three unusually loud knock sounded just under the place where he wa standing .
 Petro and his family say they have not slept for three night . They went out to stay with friend to-night , and intend to move out of the house to-morrow . Tenants in the other end of the house have heard nothing of the noise .

 Psychic Investigators Fail to Change It Into Young Man on Misty German Peak .
 WERNIGERODE , Germany , June 17 . — A group of eminent German and British investigator into psychic phenomenon ascended tonight to the top of the Brocken , Germany ’ s magic mountain , and , in accordance with ancient rite , attempted to change a billygoat into a young man . Somehow or other it didn ’ t come off .
 The failure of the experiment can not be laid to any error in method , for the investigator observed every requirement set forth in the “ High German Black Book . ”
 As demanded by the formula , the experimenter had the assistance of Miss Gloria Gordon of England , “ a maiden pure of heart . ”
 They anointed the billygoat with blood and honey and the scraping of church bell ; they used the proper pine fire ; they described a circle of the prescribed size ; and they uttered every one of the Latin incantation stipulated for such goings-on .
 Witches have frequented the Brocken ever since man can remember . The smallest boy hereabouts can tell you that .
 Even Goethe , in his “ Faust , ” recognized that this wa a place where no ordinary thing happened . He wrote :
 “ The witch on the Brocken sail , The shoot is green , The stubble ’ s pale , And high above them throne Old Nick . ”
 As prescribed by the old rite , the goat wa led into the magic circle by a silver cord . After it had been anointed a white sheet wa thrown over it . All the proper abracadabra wa intoned . Then , in a weird monotone , Harry Price , director of the National Laboratory of Psychical Research , London , boomed “ One . ”
 With just the proper pause he counted to ten .
 A hundred or so spectator , huddled in overcoat to protect them from the swirling mist , looked on in breathless silence .
 The maiden pure in heart whisked off the white sheet .
 And there stood the billygoat .
 The spectator applauded heartily and the investigator said they were satisfied . — The Associated Press

 CHICAGO , July 18 . — Frank Lowman ran swiftly to a child ’ s lemonade stand at 6,641 Perry Avenue , to-day , and asked Margaret Evans , aged seven , for a drink . As he gulped it down Margaret said , “ Were you running a race ? ”
 “ Yes , ” answered the customer .
 “ Did you beat ? ”
 “ Yes , I beat , ” said the man , a he smiled at the little storekeeper , and drew from his pocket a long-bladed knife and stirred the second glass of lemonade .
 “ You ’ re awful hot , ain ’ t you ? ” again queried the little girl . “ Did you run far ? Is the lemonade cold enough ? ”
 Just then two men turned the corner . They were the janitor of the flat building , at 6,505 Stewart Avenue , and a detective , who were pursuing the alleged burglar .
 Lowman saw them and dropped the knife which he still held in his hand . He started to run , then stopped , for he had not paid for his drink .
 “ Want some more ? ” queried the child . Lowman dropped several coin on the table a he sprinted across the street . Through a vacant lot , over a fence , and into an alley the man ran , closely pursued by the officer and the janitor , and soon another detective wa in the chase .
 The man wa captured by Detectives Nelson and Horn after a chase of several block . He had been seen trying to pick a lock in the Stewart Avenue flat building with the long knife , and one of the detective , with the janitor , had given chase . He had lost sight of his pursuer , when he stopped to drink the lemonade , and thought he had eluded them .

 Kill Canaries , Upset Goldfish , Bite Turtles and Police and Bring Call for Firemen .
 Two monkey made a shamble of Bartel ’ s animal store at 206 Fulton Street yesterday . They killed canary , they dumped goldfish on the floor , they indiscriminately bit turtle and policeman . It wa only after a two-hour battle by the fire department that they could be quieted at all . And then almost everything wa smashed .
 Patrolman Bronlevan and Sergeant Alexander Lilley arrived at the earlier stage of the rampage — just in time to see a small monkey cheerfully wring the neck of a valuable parakeet . They stopped , looked inside and saw nothing but broken glass and dead canary . While Bronleven ran to a near-by fire station , Lilley forced the door .
 Almost at once the sergeant got into trouble . He noticed that the cage of a large baboon wa open and in his frenzied effort to close it before the baboon escaped , allowed that worthy to grab his hand . While he wa trying to break loose a small monkey threw goldfish . The sergeant , to the baboon ’ s regret , escaped .
 One of the troublesome pair wa captured almost at once ; the other climbed on a high ledge and showered the policeman and fireman with bric-a-brac . It finally wa captured when it foolishly became engrossed in trying to pull the tail feather from a celluloid parrot . The assist wa credited to Patrolman Bronleven .
 With the monkey in hand , the rescuing force began picking the livestock which , liberated , wa flying or crawling happily around the room . Goldfish which showed sign of life were dumped back in the aquarium and perplexed turtle were taken from their sward of broken glass and dumped after them .
 Henry Bartels , the owner of the store , arrived from his home toward the end of the battle and said the damage would be several thousand dollar .

 I wa impressed by how long Tarell Alvin McCraney wa willing to sit in silence until I asked him something . When I first met him , on the campus of Yale University , where he is chairman of the playwriting program — one of the most exclusive in the country , admitting only three student each year — it struck me that he wa , if not distant , then at the very least aloof . Small talk wa made and pleasantry exchanged , but I couldn ’ t help noticing that there wa not much eye contact . At first I attributed this to normal self-consciousness , but a the day progressed it occurred to me that it might be a kind of honesty : He wouldn ’ t do me or himself the disrespect of offering a charm performance . He simply said it wa nice to meet me and suggested we get a bite at a nearby Cuban restaurant . Once there , he looked over the menu for not long at all before ordering the eggplant steak and then , a if on impulse , an empanada de guayaba and a cafe con leche . He would drink the coffee but would have the empanada boxed up to share , he said , with his student .
 Then came the silence . It seemed that he might have sat there all day had I let him , quietly content , thinking about various play , or current event , or music , or film . Instead , I started to explain how much the film “ Moonlight ” — based on a script McCraney wrote in his early 20 , for which he would ultimately win an Oscar — meant to me . I told him that I grew up in circumstance that allowed me to relate to it central character . And it wa here that McCraney began asking the question , leaning slightly forward over the table , regarding me with patient but curious eye : Where were my people from , what wa their world like , how did my father fit in if at all , which play did I perform in during high school , what did my mother think of my performance ? He wa a near balance of observer and observed , 60 percent admirer , 40 percent work of art .
 There were detail he would recall and bring up long after this meeting . Three week later , he would make a joke that showed he remembered my birthday . This is normally the stuff of politician — a parlor trick of remembering detail , of making others feel a if they have your care and attention . But with McCraney it doe not feel performative . He ha a way of understanding and respecting the story of anyone he chooses : my story , the story of the character in his script and play , the story of the graduate student he spends his day teaching . He asks question that draw you into relief against your background and show you not only your own beauty but also his . This , it seems , is one of the way he ha learned to navigate a treacherous world and stay intact , or a intact a a queer black man can be in America .
 The McCraney Literary Universe is a large one : He is 38 and ha seen eight play produced , written two screenplay , won a MacArthur genius grant and adapted Shakespeare for the Royal Shakespeare Company in London . ( When I asked what made him like theater when he first encountered it , he replied : “ I don ’ t necessarily know if I like it now ” — but “ the drive to do it is innate. ” ) If you want to write about this universe , you must be comfortable using the word “ beautiful. ” In McCraney ’ s work , the beauty of blackness is a praxis unto itself , the method by which larger theory about life are made manifest . The full , original title of the screenplay that became “ Moonlight ” wa “ In the Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue. ” The film , which won the Best Picture Oscar in 2017 , wasn ’ t just about the beauty of it character but about the way they fight a losing battle against that beauty — how they try to beat it out of themselves and one another . The central conflict is that of a character trying to find harmony between who he is and who he is expected to be , a struggle that is , for many black men , not a theoretical matter but a violent , corporeal one .
 The same idea recur in “ Choir Boy , ” the queer coming-of-age tale that marked McCraney ’ s Broadway debut when it opened at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater in early January . This story , too , sits amid one of the primary contradiction of black American maleness : To be black and fully realized is to be beautiful . But to be beautiful is to be wanted , which , in America , is to be unsafe .
 McCraney wa raised in a working-class family in Liberty City , a five-square-mile section of northwest Miami that is home to one of the largest black population in Florida . His mother struggled with drug addiction for the entirety of his upbringing , ultimately succumbing to AIDS-related condition when McCraney wa 22 . His future collaborator Barry Jenkins , who directed “ Moonlight , ” wa just a year older , raised just a few mile away , also by a mother struggling with addiction .
 [ Read Angela Flournoy ’ s profile of Barry Jenkins , the director of “ Moonlight . ” ]
 From the beginning , McCraney say , he wa obsessed with telling story . He credit his grandfather , who wa a Baptist minister , for deepening his understanding of the spiritual power of narrative . Growing up alongside immigrant from Haiti and Cuba also meant McCraney wa exposed to the Orishas , the pantheon of god in the Yoruba religion , a West African theology that ha found expression in the Caribbean and across the African diaspora . The story of the Orishas , like those of the Greek god , comprise a veritable soap opera of betrayal , heartbreak , love affair and tragic flaw . Their influence on McCraney wa meaningful enough that he would one day write a trilogy of drama , “ The Brother/Sister Plays , ” based on Orisha story .
 McCraney ’ s academic potential wa recognized early . In middle school , he found himself tracked into a magnet program that let him focus on literature and performing art . Thus began a long stretch of working in space where McCraney wa either the only black person present or one of very few — an experience that strike him a something of a doubtful advantage . “ You ’ re told , ‘ You ’ ve got this special gift , this thing that will cure you of your blackness , ’ ” he say . “ But then they use that same information to castigate and diminish your people . So now you ’ re alone and can ’ t relate to nobody . So what do you actually win ? ”
 As a teenager , he became politically active through street theater , working on community play designed to raise awareness of H.I.V . testing and education . He carried this political view of theater to DePaul University in Chicago . It wa in Chicago , in the early 2000s , that he auditioned for a show by the director and playwright Tina Landau , of Steppenwolf Theater , who would become his most frequent collaborator : By her count , they ’ ve done 12 production together since they first met . “ He wa just this beautiful , startling young man with lot of depth and mystery , ” she say . Years later , when he approached her to direct one of his play , she wa struck by the power of his writing . His story , she say , “ on the one hand , have not been told — because the detail , the specific , are so of his real life and the life of his character — and at the same time they operate on this very fundamental — what ’ s the word I ’ m looking for — on an ur level . ”
 After DePaul , McCraney took a year off , during which he traveled to Georgia to bury his mother and worked briefly in Miami theater . Then he took his talent to Yale , a a student in the same graduate playwriting program he now oversees . Part of his application wa an early version of the script for “ Moonlight , ” a largely autobiographical story written around the time of his mother ’ s death . It wa the overwhelming intensity of his emotion at the time , he think , that created the heightened poetry of the film . He wa unlikely , he told me , to write anything quite like that in the future . “ I wa 23 when I wrote that . I don ’ t want to be 23 again . I don ’ t want to be in that much pain ever again . ”
 If beauty is the pillar at one end of his work , pain is at the other . McCraney dig unflinchingly into the suffering that pulse at the center of his character ’ s life . I asked him about the concern some black artist and storyteller have — that our work may simply boil down to trading in black pain for rent money . “ If the question , for you , about peddling black pain is appropriate , ” he replied , “ you also have to think to yourself , well , why am I in so much pain ? ” It doesn ’ t make sense , he suggested , to demand that an artist produce joy when his or her inner life is still processing grief . He then talked about the rapper Lil Wayne , who famously suffered a gunshot wound at age 12 . For year , he said the gun had gone off by accident ; only last year did he reveal that the childhood wound wa from a suicide attempt . “ He talk about the time that he shot himself because it still haunt him , ” McCraney said . “ He woke up in a pool of blood . He ’ s , like , engaged in that , and going through it . Why is it important for u to be like , ‘ Hey , get over that . Where are the dandelion ? ’ ”
 It wa not long after McCraney ’ s graduation from Yale that he mounted his first production at Steppenwolf , became the group ’ s 43rd member and wrote and directed work for the Public Theater , Center Theater Group and the Royal Shakespeare Company , where he directed interpretation of “ Hamlet ” and “ Antony and Cleopatra. ” “ The only thing that kept me going , ” he told me of that time , thinking of the second play , “ wa : I ’ ve got to bring this play back to the little Haitian girl who live across the street from me , who have never seen themselves a royalty. ” Around this time , Barry Jenkins came across “ Moonlight ” and asked McCraney for permission to rework it into a shooting script , prompting McCraney ’ s first foray into feature film . Steven Soderbergh ’ s film of McCraney ’ s second feature , a basketball drama titled “ High Flying Bird , ” is scheduled for Netflix release in February — and in addition to the Broadway run of “ Choir Boy , ” the Oprah-led OWN network ha ordered a season of McCraney ’ s first television project , the semi-autobiographical “ David Makes Man , ” currently filming in Orlando .
 Allison Davis , a writer on “ David Makes Man , ” remembers walking into the writer ’ room with some nervousness . “ He could have thrown his ego around that room , and it would have been justified , ” she told me by phone from Los Angeles . Instead , she wa disarmed when McCraney suggested the staff begin by taking an online quiz to determine which Harry Potter house each person would belong to . “ Then we started talking about what all the house represented , and then we started talking about what in our background made u answer the way we did , and it became this very deep discussion about language and trauma and influence , and we were talking about this for like three hour . ”
 This ability to merge the mundane with the profound , to draw complex emotion out of many different people and source , is a hallmark of McCraney ’ s work . “ ‘ David Makes Man ’ pull from so many reference , ” Davis said . “ The Bible is up in there , Yoruba is up in there , Miami street culture is up in there , ball culture is up in there . He weave it into this wonderful tapestry , and he treat them all with equal reverence . ”
 “ I have never — and I mean this — never encountered a script for television with this depth of value , ” say Phylicia Rashad , one of the show ’ s star . “ Because he is bringing cultural influence that , to my knowledge , ha not been seen , but exists . ”
 There are not many people from Liberty City , Miami , directing for the Royal Shakespeare Company , winning Oscars and administering program at Yale . McCraney is consistently in rarefied air . This go beyond W.E.B . Du Bois ’ s notion of “ double consciousness. ” To be a black queer man from poverty and enjoy accolade in some of the most exclusory space in Western theater doesn ’ t just call for the maintenance of multiple consciousness ; it requires a strategy for keeping them working smoothly together . “ When people say , ‘ I ’ m tired , ’ ” McCraney told me , “ it ’ s not necessarily like , ‘ I ’ ve been working in a cotton field all day. ’ There ’ s tired , like — you just don ’ t know how much pre-thinking , post-thinking , anxiousness , anxiety , that one ha to toggle in order to deal with the United States . Not just white people , but the way that the United States is set up . ”
 His character frequently find themselves wrestling with their identity , trying desperately to keep their bearing in a world that offer them little reliable support . “ Moonlight ” tracked a young boy in Liberty City who ’ s abused for being gay before he even know what gay mean ; he find temporary solace in a local drug dealer , the first person who care more about taking care of him than about responding to his still-developing orientation . In a second chapter , the boy , now a teenager , experience his first love with another boy , after which he meet with even more bullying and violence . He is forced to defend himself , which mean closing part of himself forever . In the third chapter , he is a man — isolated , reticent , guarding his vulnerability with a tool kit composed largely of push-ups , gold teeth and firearm — when a reunion with his teenage love force him to make a decision about whether he will live and love a a queer man . Part of what make the film work so exquisitely is the consistent sense of a character ’ s trying to find alignment with his deepest self while surrounded by limitless opportunity to lie .
 In McCraney ’ s 2016 family drama , “ Head of Passes , ” Phylicia Rashad starred a the matriarch of a New Orleans family who face a crisis of faith when a terrible secret is revealed . As rain pour down , causing destruction in the family home , she must make peace with a God who would accept such suffering , while her three child rant and rage toward their own horrifying end . Comparisons with Shakespeare ’ s “ King Lear ” are easy to make , but for McCraney the plot similarity are not the point ; the character are . “ That ’ s an underutilized population of actor , ” he say of black woman entering late middle age . “ There are woman her age who don ’ t get to Lear. ” To “ Lear , ” a a verb , mean to take over a stage in your later year and expound upon life ’ s quandary . It is assumed of esteemed white male actor that they will age gracefully into such role , roaring and speechifying and showing their gravity . But where is that space for actor like Phylicia Rashad ? “ It ’ s annoying , ” McCraney say , “ because who better to Lear than these woman ? ”
 Perhaps by way of reparation , McCraney give the play over to Rashad ’ s character in the second act , granting her 20 full minute alone onstage to rail against an unforgiving God while the heaven swirl . It is thrilling to see , in part because Rashad is a master of her craft , matching the force of the nature she confronts with the force of the nature within — and in part because , a in “ Moonlight , ” we are watching a character do everything she can to hold onto a sliver of self amid a sea of violent force .
 These play are , quite possibly , McCraney ’ s own sliver of self . While “ Moonlight , ” “ Choir Boy ” and “ David Makes Man ” are more strictly autobiographical , nearly every work he creates contains element of his experience . His home and neighborhood were destroyed by Hurricane Andrew when he wa in middle school , and a frequent aspect of his script is use of the pathetic fallacy : The mood of the heaven insists itself into the plot , manifesting the inner life of his character . His narrative often feel like story of mortal adrift against a pantheon of god who are , if not capricious , deeply flawed and untrustworthy .
 In Yoruba lore , one supreme god is Obatala , who typically dress in white , can appear a either male or female and is the default owner of all soul until those soul are claimed by another Orisha . Obatala is all-powerful , the creator of humankind . But in one instance the god wa drunk on wine and made some mistake in creation . As a result , the experience of people on earth are sometimes difficult , painful and unfair . For this reason , Obatala look upon our suffering with extra care and favor . Unlike the Christian God , whose absolution serf a evidence of his faultlessness , Obatala doe not grant u charity because we are imperfect . Obatala grant u charity because Obatala is imperfect .
 If the playwright is a creator of world , he is every bit a forgiving and loving of his subject a Obatala is . There is a kindness in his treatment of character , a clear love . A major factor in the creation of “ Head of Passes , ” McCraney told me , his voice raising a couple of pitch , a smile opening up across his face , wa that he just love “ seeing black woman looking at and talking to black woman onstage . There is nothing better . ”
 On a Saturday morning in December , I arrived at a Manhattan Theater Club studio in a building on West 43rd Street to watch rehearsal for “ Choir Boy. ” The play tell the story of an openly gay teenage boy , Pharus , who is the head of the prestigious choir at a stalwart all-black boarding academy called the Charles R. Drew Prep School for Boys . His sexuality , a well a his general boldness and impulsivity , put his relationship — and sometimes his body — at risk , and force his peer to confront their own love and insecurity . The music consists entirely of interpolation of Negro spiritual and folk song like “ Rockin ’ Jerusalem ” and “ Keep Your Eyes on the Prize , ” delivered in multipart harmony by the nine actor playing student . In the scene I watched the cast work on , the character of David , played by Caleb Eberhardt , decides to open his heart to another character , which he doe by starting off a song , “ Motherless Child. ” The lyric — “ sometimes I feel like a motherless child/a long way from home ” — date back to slavery , and like the word of most spiritual , they have a clear and heavy range of meaning . You can interpret them a personal , spiritual and political , all at once .
 All those meaning are at play in the scene . The boy of Drew are , literally , a long way from home . They share shower , sleep in dorm room and can call home only once a week . They are left to build themselves out of whatever is in the air : tough but fair headmaster , a dignified but burdensome “ black excellence ” tradition , a sky full of forceful and conflicting expectation of black masculinity . It is too much and boil over .
 Tensions are high among the boy in the locker room , who are still buzzing over a recent near-fight . David , on the way to the shower , stop to sing the first stanza of the song alone , then to a classmate . Then the entire group join in , sending their voice echoing off unforgiving tile . It is meant to be heart-rending .
 The problem , this morning , wa that it wasn ’ t working . The director , Trip Cullman — he most recently directed Kenneth Lonergan ’ s “ Lobby Hero , ” last year — wa gamely trying different way of transitioning into this fraught moment . What if Eberhardt did it from upstage ? What if he went halfway off and came back ? What if he started quietly and then built ?
 The playwright wa present , wearing a cream-colored cardigan , crisp jean and gleaming , off-white , all-leather Chuck Taylors , seated at a folding table crowded with script binder and room-temperature coffee . So far , I had heard him say little . But now he asked for the floor . The actor took seat . I noticed I wa nervous for him . When the actor are struggling and the director can ’ t seem to find a solution , you ’ re forced to ask : Could the problem be the script ?
 But when McCraney talked , he didn ’ t talk about the play or the dialogue . Instead , he talked about grief . Casually , a though it were something that just came to his mind . He explained what it felt like to lose his mother at 22 . He did not talk about how she died , and he hinted only a little at the complexity of their relationship ; this address wa not autobiographical . It wa to do with emotion . McCraney described how grief life in a person ’ s body , how it settle there . He explained it half-life , the unreliable nature of it decay . He talked about the phenomenon , when grieving a loved one , in which you begin to have memory of time after their death that you think they must have been present for . Remember when I won an Academy Award for my movie , and you were so proud ? And then he talked about how thing like that make you grieve their absence all over again , and how that grief catch you unawares , taking over your body when you least expect it . It sits in a small reservoir beneath your heart . It whisper to you at odd hour and yell at you in quiet one .
 I teared up just a little bit hearing it . My own mother died in my arm almost exactly 10 year earlier . My relationship with her wa also complicated . My grief also weave in and out of being with little explanation or predictability . McCraney wa calling something into the room , I might even say invoking it . All that wa happening wa that he wa explaining something about grief — something that he , at age 38 , knew , and that the cast , talented black Broadway-level actors/dancers/singers ranging in age from maybe 20 to 25 , may not yet have known but were capable of understanding .
 When he wa done explaining , Eberhadt spoke up . “ I have an idea , ” he said . “ Is it O.K . if I try something ? ” To which McCraney replied : “ It ’ s your show , man . Absolutely . ”
 Back to place . The boy were at their fake locker wearing fake towel ; Eberhadt stood upstage , fake shower caddy in hand . Action . He turned downstage , thought about singing to one boy , decided against it . Caught his breath . Blinked . Called out the first word of the song with a force that seemed century old . Sometimes . It echoed and landed . There wa silence . We felt it in our chest . He continued . Sometimes I don ’ t know where to go . My mother , my father won ’ t own me . So I try to make heaven my home .
 Now the chorus joined in . It wa a youthful mourning , a boyish mourning . A male and adolescent mourning . A black one . A harmonious one . The song grew , the room wa filled with it , it cascaded outward , upward from their body in cloud of spirit that , if you closed your eye , you could almost see . When they finished , there wa a moment of quiet in the room before the director said , simply : “ Yeah . That ’ s it . ”
 The moment McCraney lit up the most , smiled the widest , wa when we began to talk about Spike Lee . “ This man can shoot a film , ” he said . “ Nobody capture u in a cinematic , moving experience like Spike Lee. ” One of his favorite , he told me , wa Lee ’ s sophomore feature , “ School Daze , ” released in 1988 . It ’ s fair to say I wa , a a youth , obsessed with this film : I had entire scene memorized . I bought a copy of the script and read it late at night by flashlight .
 McCraney ’ s excitement caused me to revisit it . It is just a I remembered it : wild , unclean , slapdash , hyperstylized . It ’ s a comedy about an uber-woke student at a historically black college — played by a very young Laurence Fishburne — and his battle with a black-and-bougie frat-boy nemesis ( Giancarlo Esposito ) and his girlfriend ( Tisha Campbell ) . “ It ’ s just extraordinary , ” McCraney told me . “ If you ever wanted to talk about Spike Lee having a black queer aspect , it ’ s in ‘ School Daze. ’ Because even in his endeavor to talk about the binary of colorism , he end up just exploring everything that ’ s in the middle . ”
 The scene McCraney told me he most loved wa the jazz and R & B legend Phyllis Hyman ’ s performance at the school ’ s homecoming dance . Hyman is an undiluted marvel in all black , crowned by a regal headpiece with a shimmering gemstone in the center . Lee stop time in the film to admire her , matching the camera ’ s movement to her lithe alto and the warm , velvet delivery of her lyric . It is a meditation , a reminder of all that we a black people posse , our history , our musicality , the art of it and the refinement of it . Hyman , who wa 38 when “ School Daze ” wa released , wa an extraordinary talent who never experienced the fame reached by contemporary like Anita Baker or Whitney Houston , despite being , perhaps , the better singer . When she committed suicide with a cocktail of sleeping pill in her Midtown apartment seven year later , she left a note . “ I ’ m tired , ” it said . “ I ’ m tired. ” Not working-in-a-cotton-field tired , but pre-thinking , post-thinking , anxiety and suffering and grief tired . Rewatching “ School Daze ” made me want to hug and protect every single black person on the screen ; it made me want to keep Phyllis Hyman alive . It made me want to sing along with the choir in the rehearsal studio . It reminded me that I am not alone in feeling , sometimes , like a motherless child , a long , long way from home .
 The emotional stake for black artist are often so very high . It can be overwhelming to be deeply sensitive , to love your people so much and still watch daily what is done to them . The century of pain , the unanswered call for humanity , the depth of grief sometimes threaten to become too much , too heavy . It is no wonder that there are those among u who take into their mouth entire bottle of sleeping pill or put pistol to their 12-year-old chest until there is no more left to feel .
 To love black people immensely , to celebrate our very being a poetry , to lose yourself in our story , to search them desperately and perpetually for our beauty — at the rehearsal for “ Choir Boy , ” what I witnessed wa a man who ha made himself a connoisseur of grief sharing that expertise with a roomful of younger black artist . His power , sure , is that he ’ s a playwright and that he ha , through decade of study and training , built , from the ground up , a container for his mastery of feeling . Understanding and creating story ha been one survival method . But another ha been the development of a keen , patient and nearly pansophical emotional intelligence . He ha , in a sense , cracked the code on how to remain safe a a beautiful black man , at least for himself . It is , of course , to focus almost entirely on understanding and showing the beauty of others like you .

 “ King Lear ” ha long been the crowning performance for actor who know how to dominate a stage . As a longstanding member of Parliament , Jackson ha unique insight into authority .

 It ha been a bitter season . Britain lie divided , gripped by an identity crisis , it future uncertain . Sectarian violence flare . Terrorism and freak weather . There are resurgence of deadly disease , famine , portent of worse to come . Life on this planet suddenly seems too fragile to be borne .
 It is the year 1606 . William Shakespeare turn 42 , an old man at a time when life expectancy run to the mid-40s . His productive day seem behind him ; he writes le and le . He ha every incentive to retire comfortably in the country . Instead , he produce three of his major work in the span of a year : “ Macbeth , ” “ Antony and Cleopatra ” and the bleakest , greatest play in the language , “ King Lear , ” his colossus , a play that refracts every tension of it time — the return of the plague to London , Guy Fawkes and the plot to blow up Parliament . It is a work that seems calculated to flatter and admonish — to throw support behind King James ’ s effort to unify Britain but to also caution about the corruption of power .
 Four hundred year later in an eerily similar season , another artist is completing a hat trick of her own . After 23 year away , Glenda Jackson , 82 , the two-time Oscar winner who spent the last two decade a a member of Parliament , returned to acting . In 2016 she played King Lear at the Old Vic theater in London , won a Tony Award for her turn in Edward Albee ’ s “ Three Tall Women ” last year and , this spring , she brings Lear to Broadway in a new production opening in April . The play ha never felt more vibrantly responsive to the moment , to a crisis in global leadership —
 No , I can hear Jackson now , interrupting me . No . I think it would be remarkably arrogant to try to make Shakespeare a commentary . It ha it own life .
 Fair enough . Next month , “ King Lear ” arrives on Broadway , allowing u an opportunity to see our own time reflected in the classic —
 You really must be more precise . She thump the table in irritation . Shakespeare writes about human , and human don ’ t change .
 Very well . When Glenda Jackson brings King Lear to Broadway , what a chance it will be to see timeless concern —
 Seems timely to me . Edmund complains old people die before giving their child money , when they are too old to spend it . If that ’ s not the millennial trope , I don ’ t know what is .
 Last time . This spring , Glenda Jackson return to the stage in “ King Lear. ” Her other great vocation — her campaign against imprecision and intellectual slovenliness , obsequiousness and mediocrity in all form — continues unabated .
 A bit strong . You can add “ in vain , ” if you like .
 The London production of “ King Lear , ” directed by Deborah Warner , wa austere , Brechtian and British , with a sly indictment of Blairism . The set wa constructed of white , portable panel , and actor carried their chair on and off the stage . Jackson delivered her opening line with her back to the audience . The Broadway play a envisioned by the director Sam Gold , however , is lush ; the set , a jewel box , with brassy , Trumpian accent . Jackson ’ s Lear not only face the audience but play to u and play with u . In the opening scene , Lear divide his kingdom among his daughter — “ conferring them on younger strength while we/Unburdened crawl toward death. ” Jackson roll the r ’ s in “ crawl , ” stretching the word long and louche , a purring lion , all easy , unstrained dominance that flare into spectacular explosion of rage .
 At 82 , she doe not look whittled , wizened or weathered or any one of those wheezy word we use for old body . She doe not look diminished — she look distilled , unwrapped , the long bare branch of her body mesmerizing . “ Glenda is so lean , and I don ’ t just mean that physically , ” the actor Elizabeth Marvel , who play Goneril , told me . “ I mean that emotionally , intellectually . All the fat is burned off , and you just have this brilliant diamond core. ” Jackson is not the first woman to play Lear , nor doe gender enter your mind a you watch her . She herself ha spoken of how difference between the sex fade with age , but her authority ha always transcended any notion of gender ; it ha always felt like law . The first time she played Shakespeare , in 1965 , one review wa headlined “ Ophelia , Prince of Stratford . ”
 “ There aren ’ t a lot of actor in the world that you can cast in a part like this , who can just enter the room and bring so much power with them , ” Gold told me . “ They don ’ t have to work or earn it , they just have it. ” What is the source of that power ? Jackson is the smallest person on stage , but you won ’ t notice it — she arrives cascading over the language , dominating it . In this way Jackson give u the only truly contemporary interpretation of Lear I ’ ve ever seen , a king whose command relies not on brute might but in the ability to manipulate word . The actor playing Lear must not only embody authority but also slough it off in front of u , almost presenting the aging process brutally sped up . The ritual aspect of this transformation is of particular interest to Gold , who ha directed stripped-down interpretation of Shakespeare , including “ Othello ” in 2016 . “ Glenda is going to do something very intense , very special , very big , ” he said . “ She is going to go through something most people don ’ t go through . You ’ re all invited . Glenda Jackson is going to endure this , and you ’ re going to witness it . ”
 For most of it history , this ritual ha been considered too traumatizing for the stage . Shakespeare himself worried the conclusion wa too bleak ; he appears to have softened it slightly a few year after the play wa first put on . Still , for 150 year an adapted version , with a happy ending , wa performed . In the kingdom of Lear , there is no consolation . Characters learn to see the truth only after their eye are gouged out ; they learn to love their child only a they mourn them . Lear dy of heartbreak , annihilated , his last line a howl . It is a play of such immensity — of sorrow and language — that it ha been described a too big for the stage , a literary achievement and not a dramatic one , or even a natural phenomenon in it own right : a volcano to the essayist Charles Lamb , a hurricane to the poet Samuel Coleridge and to the critic William Hazlitt , the sea : “ swelling , chafing , raging , without bound , without hope , without beacon , or anchor. ” This is not to mention the deep , dislocating strangeness of the play itself . The improbability in the plot alone have kept scholar busy for close to 400 year . It is set in 800 B.C . yet all sign point to the Middle Ages . Lear and the villain , Edmund , never interact . There is an odd lack of stage direction and that superfluous subplot , the story of Gloucester , which just echo the main action ( a father betrayed by his child ) .
 The deepest strangeness of all : None of this matter . Critics have argued that the play is greater for these inconsistency — more vast , a capricious and real a the world itself .
 Lear remains the crowning role of the most powerful actor of their generation . “ When you ’ re younger , Lear doesn ’ t feel real , ” Laurence Olivier once said . “ When you get to my age , you are Lear in every nerve of your body. ” Most performance follow in the footstep of Paul Scofield , who played the king a a grizzled military man in the 1962 Peter Brook production , later a film . Ian McKellen put his slant on the role , making Lear a priestly figure ; Christopher Plummer played him a a dementia patient .
 Jackson ’ s approach owes to none of these . In preview this month , she looked slim a a match , dapper in a tuxedo and gleaming shoe . This is not Lear a I ’ ve known him , burly and braying . This is Lear a tactician , Lear a brain a well a body , who suffers not only the betrayal of his daughter and the mortification of age but the limitation of living with his own mind . It is a role known for volume ; the originality of Jackson ’ s performance is it inwardness . We see how power work not just on the world but on the self — how it distorts perception . I saw it one night in a small gesture . Lear ha banished Cordelia , his favorite daughter , for her failure to flatter him . He coiled up in his throne and shook his head angrily , in disbelief , and repeated that gesture throughout the act , shading it motion and meaning subtly each time , from disgust to denial , a if tossing away a rogue thought , the suspicion that he ha made a terrible mistake . Jackson show u the effort that power ha to expend to not know , to stay blind .
 She steer clear of academic interpretation of “ King Lear. ” It ’ s all in the text , she say , and she build her character from the smallest reaction . “ It ’ s trying to find always the reality of being a human being a opposed to being a character in a play , ” she told me . “ They don ’ t know they ’ re in a play . They ’ re living their life . It ’ s that ; it ’ s trying to find that reality. ” You could make a study of the movement of Jackson ’ s right hand alone : how it float up and clutch at the heart in the second act , a the knowledge that Lear can ’ t shake off — of his elder daughter ’ cruelty and his own folly — begin to lodge in the body ; how it jab at his daughter a he fire malediction upon them ; how it open and close a he succumbs to madness , grasping at air . And in the final scene , Lear reach for Cordelia ’ s lifeless hand and run it over his face — she is finally a real to him a he is to himself .
 “ She doe it differently every night , ” Ruth Wilson , who play Cordelia and the Fool , told me . “ It never go stale . Sometimes in the storm scene , she ’ s pushing the Fool off , sometimes holding him close . That ’ s what Lear would be doing . You have to constantly move around this person who ’ s volatile , and you don ’ t know which way the wind is blowing with them , and you have to kind of negotiate with them . That ’ s what she ’ s like on the stage . ”
 Who ’ s afraid of Glenda Jackson ? Most people , and with some cause . She became famous for her electrifying portrayal of history and literature ’ s most unconventional woman : Queen Elizabeth in the British TV series “ Elizabeth R , ” Hedda Gabler , Gudrun in Ken Russell ’ s film of the D.H. Lawrence novel “ Women in Love , ” released in Britain in 1969 . In life she ha proved no le formidable ; the story are legion , dark and thrilling , assuming you ’ re not on your way to interview her yourself . There is the journalist she famously called “ a patronizing git. ” There is an interview from last year in which she turned so gladiatorial toward a Los Angeles Times critic even she wa taken aback . “ I ’ ve frightened you , ” she told him , chastened , and suggested he “ get some rest. ” A 1999 biography of the actor by Chris Bryant , a fellow Labor politician , read rather like a group-therapy session of colleague and director processing their unsettling encounter with her .
 I first met Jackson in January , at a restaurant near her hotel in New York . Rehearsals for the play had just begun . She arrived , brisk and bundled in a black puffy coat over a checked dress , and immediately ordered a glass of white wine . “ Pour it out , ” she said , waving away the offer to taste it first . “ I smoke so I have no — what do they call it these day ? ” She glanced at the menu , ordered “ the salmon thingie thingie ” and looked at me expectantly . “ Fire away . ”
 “ A-ma-zing , ” she said , when the food arrived : slab of lox fanned out and enormous , like a fleshy , quivering petticoat . There are word she say so distinctly that they are hers : the emphatic “ ab-solutely , ” the caress of “ a-ma-zing , ” her witheringly indifferent “ quite ” and , all variant of “ no , ” “ not ” and “ never. ” Her voice — called one of the theater ’ s great instrument — remains unchanged ; it is still warm , deep and honeyed , like wood cracking apart in a fire . Her large , expressive hand sliced and framed each argument .
 We met through the winter on Sundays , her day off , her day for laundry and ironing and calling home to London . Jackson share a home with her son , the political columnist Dan Hodges . Of his conservative leaning she ha said , “ I think you have done quite well a a parent if your kid hold position totally opposite to your own. ” She life in the basement apartment , and when she ’ s not working , she ’ s on grandmother duty , caring for her 11-year-old grandson . “ We have fierce fight about what he watch on the bloody computer , ” she said . Every time we met , she arrived punctually and apologized for being late , wearing more often than not a soft lavender sweatshirt with a silhouette of Tintin and eating exactly half of what wa on her plate .
 “ Shakespeare is the most contemporary writer there is , ” Jackson told me . “ He only ever really asks three question : Who are we ? Why are we ? What are we ? And no one ha ever come up with the comprehensive answer to any of those questions. ” “ King Lear ” is “ entirely about human being — their interaction and their failure to interact , to understand each other . Which we all know . We presume we know people by virtue of having known them for a long time . Of course we never really do . ”
 Has anyone presumed to know Jackson ? Her biographer found her privacy impossible to breach . During their interview session , she sat with her back to him . “ The mystery is what make her so compelling onstage and on film , ” Bryant ha said . “ You can sense the sharp intelligence , the grit , but you don ’ t know what is going on. ” Her inwardness is key to her appeal , that nervy detachment . “ Staccato , wrenchingly modern , ” Pauline Kael once called her . It ’ s why she is so enjoyable to watch in her worst movie . Take the 1973 film “ A Touch of Class , ” which won her an Oscar , a romantic comedy in the Hepburn-Tracy mode , in which Jackson play a castrating career woman who must be brought to heel . Her line are ridiculous ( so is that broomlike wig ) , but her acting is full of integrity and private amusement , delivered over the shoulder of the hero , to the camera — to u . It isn ’ t the cross-gender casting of Lear that feel so striking about Jackson ’ s performance ; it is seeing an actor who specializes in control and self-knowledge take on the unraveling patriarch who ha “ ever but slenderly known himself . ”
 Like all well-defended people , however , Jackson seems privately moved , even impressed by vulnerability , a if it were a luxury she can ’ t yet afford . When she met Stevie Smith , the English poet she would later portray in the 1978 film “ Stevie , ” she wa stirred : “ There wasn ’ t a single protective curve anywhere in her body. ” In my own haplessness , I , too , become the object of her gruff gallantry and concern . Who wa minding my small daughter when we were off together ? Is her father good with her ? Do I need a ride ? Money for lunch ? When is my deadline ? So soon ? Under no circumstance , however , would she accept such solicitude from me ; she would hand it right back , like an armful of rotting fish . She once mentioned that it wa sometimes difficult to get her family on the phone on Sundays . I made consoling noise . “ That ’ s hard , ” I said . “ It ’ s not hard , ” she snapped . “ They ’ re out a lot . ”
 Thorns are , of course , aborted branch . Jackson bloomed when we shifted off the topic of her and her work . She wa keen to talk about child , Emily Dickinson , the enormousness of American serving portion , the “ glorious ” television show “ Parks and Recreation ” and , with much frustrated thumping of the table , Brexit ( “ What is Jeremy Corbyn doing ? I wonder he can sit down , he ’ s been on the fence so long ” ) .
 “ For me , the two most important word in the English language are ‘ Only connect , ’ ” she told me , quoting E.M. Forster . But with Jackson , you feel that injunction ha a much to do with a desire to forge connection with other people a with maintaining , and protecting , a connection with the self and with reality , hence that almost phobic refusal of sympathy and any kind of special dispensation . When she spoke of artist she admired — Emily Dickinson and Stevie Smith — it wa for how they combined the wild “ landscape ” in their mind with the simplicity of their life and the unfussy way they met their social obligation . “ I don ’ t like the starry sort of life , ” she told her biographer . “ The more remote you become from people , the more difficult it is to act , I think . Most life are not comprised of enormous tragedy or enormous joy , but they are comprised of tiny little pin prick , of having to queue at the butcher or it ’ s raining when you ’ re waiting for a bus . ”
 Jackson wa born in 1936 in the Cheshire region of Northern England , the eldest of four daughter . Her father hauled brick at construction site , and her mother cleaned house and pulled pint at the pub . When the war broke out , Jackson ’ s father joined the minesweeper , and the woman took over — her mother , aunt and grandmother . These woman , a she described them , were her first , most decisive piece of good luck . “ Their life hadn ’ t dealt them a particularly good hand by any stretch of the imagination , ” she said . “ But they had no small sense of humor . They had grace . All those cliché thing like it ’ s no use cry over spilt milk or all that were very real . Life had to be lived . You had to get on and do it . It wa very valuable to me . ”
 This is the very lesson of Lear , delivered in rhyming cadence . When Gloucester , blinded and betrayed , collapse in anguish , his son Edgar urge him on : “ Men must endure/ Their going hence , even a their coming hither ; / Ripeness is all. ” It kept happening a I spoke to Jackson . She would begin by telling me about herself , and we would veer into Lear . The text is never out of her hand , she told me ; I felt a if she were merging with it .
 She wa always a ravenous reader , if an indifferent student ; she tried to read every book in her local public library . She loved the Brontës , and her political awakening wa stirred by Sinclair Lewis . At 16 , she failed her exam , left school and took a job working at Boots the Chemists . She had been raised to have no expectation , she told me , but something had begun to nag at her . “ There had to be more to life than what I wa experiencing , and I had more to give than what wa being asked of me. ” She started doing amateur theater and wa told she wa promising . She wrote to the only drama school she ’ d ever heard of , the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art , and wangled herself a scholarship .
 One of her first acting job wa in Crewe , in the north of England , “ half acting , half stage-managing and full-time sweeping the floor. ” She met and married Roy Hodges , a part-time actor . ( They divorced almost 20 year later . ) They occasionally slept on the stage of the theater , in a four-poster bed sourced for a production . Lean year followed . Jackson worked odd job , waitressed and even stole food . For two year she didn ’ t get any theater work . Her break came when she auditioned for the Royal Shakespeare Company ’ s experimental Theater of Cruelty , directed by Peter Brook and Charles Marowitz . They wanted to launch an attack on staid English theater , to make it more visceral and le literary . “ In came a very curious figure , a hidden , shy and yet aggressive , badly dressed girl who seemed resentful of everything , ” Brook recalled of Jackson ’ s audition . She did a reading from Shakespeare and a Dorothy Parker short story , which she wa asked to play a a woman incarcerated in a psychiatric hospital by her husband , trying to persuade others of her sanity . “ There wa , ” she said , “ a fair amount of rolling around and shouting . ”
 She made her name with uninhibited performance : a star-making turn a the narcoleptic assassin Charlotte Corday in “ Marat/Sade ” and a a composite of Christine Keeler and Jackie Kennedy in an infamous collage piece in which she wa supposedly the first actor to appear naked on the London stage .
 Jackson won two best-actress Oscars in four year , for “ Women in Love ” and “ A Touch of Class. ” Presenting her with the New York Film Critics Circle Award for “ Women in Love , ” Bette Davis said she felt like Margo Channing , the star of “ All About Eve , ” being supplanted by a younger rival . Jackson chafed at celebrity , however . She gloated about wearing a £2 dress from Marks & Spencer to meet Jackie Kennedy ( “ with the rest of them dripping diamond down to their navel ” ) and didn ’ t attend either of the Academy Awards ceremony at which she won . She passed along her Oscars to her mother , who displayed them in her front room and polished them so religiously that the gold disappeared and the base metal beneath wa revealed . “ A very good analogy , ” Jackson like to say .
 A revulsion for Hollywood and it fraudulence still lingers . She told me about a friend who had been invited to one of Alfred Hitchcock ’ s party for the A-list . Everything he served wa blue . The potato were blue . The cauliflower wa blue . The sauce wa blue — “ and nobody , nobody said a word . I bet he and Mrs. Hitchcock roared with laughter going to bed at all these sanctimonious sod who were afraid to say , ‘ Why have you given me blue cauliflower ? ’ ” ( Seen this way , Jackson ’ s famous bluntness feel like a way of staying primed for a blue-cauliflower situation . )
 “ He wa bizarre , ” she said of Hitchcock . “ And his treatment of that one in ‘ The Birds ’ — ”
 “ Tippi Hedren , ” I said . “ Wasn ’ t she institutionalized ? ”
 “ He kept her out of work , ” she said , making me feel a if I ’ d missed the real indignity . Hedren accused Hitchcock of sexually assaulting her and having her blacklisted for year .
 I asked if she felt vulnerable a a young actress . “ You ’ re entirely dependent on what may come through the door , ” she said . “ I always say — when someone tell me , ‘ I ’ m thinking of being an actor , what do you think ? ’ — ‘ If you ’ re thinking about it , don ’ t go anywhere near it . If it ’ s not life or death , don ’ t touch it. ’ ”
 It came a a surprise when Jackson left acting in 1992 to become a Labor M.P . from Hampstead and Highgate in North London , but she had been approached before . ( “ They must be bloody hard up , ” she had said to her agent . ) She had long been outspoken about her opposition to Thatcherism and also her disappointment in the role offered to woman . “ If woman are ever shown to have problem in a film , they are always emotional problem , ” she said . “ What about the other problem , the other issue that woman face every day of their life ? I haven ’ t seen a woman take a stand on a moral issue in a film for about 20 year , not since Bette Davis played that librarian in ‘ Storm Center. ’ ”
 Entering politics allowed her to write that very role . She committed herself utterly ; in her 23 year in Parliament , she told me that she didn ’ t see a single play . She wa an outspoken critic of the Iraq War and Tony Blair ; she said he “ suffered from the insolence of office ” ( a quote from Hamlet ) . She gave passionate speech in support of the welfare state and condemned Margaret Thatcher ’ s legacy in the House of Commons day after her death in 2013 . It might be one of her most indelible performance . She stood alone , in a red cardigan , facing a bank of dark-suited men . “ My honorable friend from Hackney referred to the fact that although she had differed with Lady Thatcher in her policy , she felt dutybound to come to pay tribute to the first woman prime minister this country had produced . I am of a generation who wa raised by woman ; the men had all gone to war to defend our freedom — they didn ’ t just run a government ; they ran a country. ” The Royal Academy of Dramatic Art diction wa clear , and her voice rose effortlessly over the braying . She spoke with relish , tasting each word : “ To pay tribute to the first prime minister deputed by female gender ? O.K . But a woman ? ” She raised her chin . “ Not on my term . ”
 She started seeing the seed of Brexit 10 year ago , perhaps longer . “ What backbench M.P.s like me were getting on the street were complaint from our constituent : no affordable housing , couldn ’ t get their kid into school , the National Health Service wa being overworked , wage were going down in job and it wa all the fault of immigrant , ” she said . “ People who wouldn ’ t know , in my country , an immigrant if one came up and hit them in the face were the first to say , ‘ Get these people out. ’ ”
 She wa reluctant , however , when I asked what specifically she worked on , what her proudest achievement were . The people she helped knew what they were , she said . I tried to ask again in different way ; every time , my question pinged off her hull . Jackson can remind you of Cordelia in the way she hoard her deepest feeling and her refusal to appease .
 She stepped down before the 2015 election . It wa “ time to let someone else have a go , ” she said . Casting around for a role , she wa inspired by her friend the Spanish actress Núria Espert ’ s playing Lear in Barcelona and approached the Old Vic . The review were glowing . “ Could it be that a seasoning in the daily parry and thrust of the House of Commons ha kept Ms. Jackson ’ s wit and acumen , not to mention her capacity for language , razor sharp ? ” Matt Wolf , a theater critic for The New York Times , wrote .
 Jackson ’ s standard line wa that theater would never tolerate the kind of ego she encountered in Parliament . But there are link between acting and politics , and on this topic , she is at her most fluent . Each require stripping down to the essence of who we are and what we need . In the case of acting , that process can be mysterious ; it is a process , she ha said , that no one can even define . She told me the famous , possibly apocryphal story about Laurence Olivier performing Othello at the Old Vic , performing a he never had before . The cast watched him , rapt from the wing . The crowd went wild . And he went straight to his dressing room and began smashing it up . “ In typical theater courage , ” Jackson said , the youngest member of the crew wa sent to investigate : “ ‘ Sir Laurence , we don ’ t understand . You were absolutely wonderful. ’ ‘ I know , ’ he responded . ‘ But I don ’ t know why. ’ ”
 In those moment , she told me , even if you don ’ t know why , an energy is produced and sent into the dark . The audience responds and sends the light back , forming a perfect , unbound , unbroken circle . “ It is the model of an ideal society , ” incumbent on everyone working together . “ It doesn ’ t always happen , but it ha happened enough to know that it ’ s possible . ”
 Weeks later , watching a preview , I saw that light come streaming off the stage . It wa the storm scene , the furious heart of the play . Lear stalk the heath with his loyal friend Kent and the Fool . The theater wa slashed with bright lightning , and the character hurled themselves against a metal wall to simulate thunder . Jackson wa chalk-white under the light , stripped down to a singlet and lit up like the Parthenon , a fabulous ruin . Her hair wa wet and matted , and she bit off each word , spittle popping off her lip , her hand cutting the air , eye rolling around in her head — a figure of terrifying aloneness and confrontation . She gazed into the audience , pitilessly , an emissary from our collective future : “ Poor naked wretches. ” The scene built and built without cresting , Lear flinging off Kent and the Fool who tried to cover and protect him . Finally the action of the play turned elsewhere . The three retreated to one side of the stage . Jackson sat down and closed her eye ; she looked emptied . The Fool curled up next to her , grimaced and whispered something . She did not open her eye . She did not respond .
 Jackson wa asked in an interview when she returned to Broadway last year , to star in “ Three Tall Women , ” if acting wa depleting . “ No , ” she said emphatically . But then her voice softened , and it sounded a if she were seeing something for the first time . “ In a strange kind of way you should have nothing to take home . You should have put everything that ha to be put on that stage , ” she said . “ Shame on you if you have something to take home . ”
 On the stage , after a minute , Jackson opened her eye , focused . She charged the stage again ; the storm strengthened . She raised her arm and caught a bit of the lightning .
 “ The age thing wa potent last night , ” Jackson said to me .
 It wa our final meeting , and she had stopped letting her P.R . people make our reservation . No more fancy restaurant . She had chosen a place herself ; a warm , shabby diner . I met her outside , already defeated by the day : a sleepless child , a lost wallet and the encroaching light paranoia induced by the morning ’ s string of bad luck . I hadn ’ t smoked in year , but I bummed a cigarette off Jackson and smoked quickly , worried she wa getting cold while she waited . “ Don ’ t rush , ” she said grandly . “ You ’ re just killing yourself. ” We stood together in the sun amid a bank of melting snow .
 The play had entered preview , and her schedule wa grueling . Rehearsals at midday were followed by a short break for dinner then the nightly performance . But work clearly simultaneously relaxes and energizes Jackson . She wa open and voluble that day , ruminative . Her large hand lay open on the table between u , like a flower . Stories from her childhood came tumbling out on top of one another , the one and only time her father raised his voice to the child , when one of Jackson ’ s sister dressed up the cat in doll clothes ; the way her mother would check her daughter ’ s shoe when she came home to visit to make sure she had enough money . “ It ’ s a curious thing , ” she said . “ It ’ s an absurd thing to say . Of course she ’ s dead . I mean — all of my family apart from one sister — my immediate family is dead . But I still find myself walking past a shop and thinking , I must get that for my mum . ”
 A friend of hers wa in the audience the previous night and told her how moved the audience had been by Jackson ’ s performance , by “ the age thing , ” a Jackson put it , that intimation of what wa to come . I asked her if she ever feared getting older . She shook her head , mouth full of waffle . The invisibility of youth had been the indignity . Age ha been more annoyance than anything else . “ The essential you is on the inside , it stay the same , ” she told me . “ I mean , the envelope you inhabit doesn ’ t respond a it should . My handwriting is appalling , this arm shake for no good reason . I have backache . You ’ re getting old , so what ? But it ’ s irritating . ”
 Gloria Steinem once said that getting older wa like falling off a cliff ; there were no woman she thought she could emulate . I wanted to tell Jackson this , about having had this feeling and not having it anymore . I wanted to tell her something about her beauty and asperity , about watching her catch the lightning in her hand onstage , but she would have yelled at me and told me to stop being sentimental . Plus , she wa getting up to go . “ I can leave you a cigarette , ” she said , pulled a Dunhill from the pack and slid it across the table . “ But I won ’ t leave you my lighter . You ’ ll have to find someone to help you . ”
 I smoked her cigarette outside the diner and scanned the street for her silhouette , the way she would move quickly but carefully through the slushy sidewalk , shoulder back , duty discharged . Jackson hum a she walk . It ’ s an old habit . Once , a she walked through her constituency , humming , two young girl started following her . They trailed her for some time . They told her they wanted to hear what happened next . I wa embarrassed by my desire to do the same . Tell me what happens next , Glenda .
 I returned to the table to gather my thing and pay the bill , only to be interrupted by her for the last time . In my open notebook , I saw her word in my hand . We had been talking about Shakespeare ; “ the man , ” she call him affectionately , “ Mr . William. ” “ I ’ ve held in my hand a folio edition of ‘ Antony and Cleopatra , ’ ” she had said . “ There is one full stop in that play . It ’ s after the last line . ”

And always , they give u a deeper understanding of what it ’ s like to be a teenager today .
 We ’ ve gathered the response to three such prompt below . This week , teenager told u what it ’ s really like to grow up in a culture of online public shaming ; shared how technology ha shaped the way they apologize ; and wrote short story and poem about what they imagine the future will look like .
 And though we don ’ t round up the response to our Article of the Day and Film Club feature here , we also want to acknowledge the many comment we received on an article and short film we featured honoring the Feb. 14 anniversary of the Parkland shooting . There , student shared their support for the victim and survivor of Parkland , a well a their own fear and anxiety about being a part of the “ mass shooting generation . ”

 Outrage erupted online after Esquire Magazine released their March 2019 cover story earlier this month , portraying the quintessential “ American Boy ” a white , middle-class boy . People ridiculed not only the magazine , but also the subject of the story : 17-year-old Ryan Morgan . In a related Op-Ed , Robyn Kanner argues that online public shaming like this prevents people , especially teenager , from being able to learn , grow and change .
 In this Student Opinion question , we asked student if they agreed with Ms. Kanner . They shared with u what it ’ s like to grow up in a culture of digital shaming , and the way it ha both opened their eye and scared them into silence .
 Should teenager be held to the same standard a adult ?
 As a very average teenager i believe that it is very unfair to judge someone for their thought and action a a teenager . We often say without thinking and simply think what our peer think . We go with what everyone else is doing and that is why often time a lot of teen make bad decision . We are pressured to do what everyone else is doing without even realizing the pressure is there .
 — Thomas , silverton30
 Teenagers are not oblivious and blind . They know their action , and infantilizing and pitying them to avoid addressing their genuinely problematic action is part of the problem . Not checking these action in formative year pave the way for them to do the same a adult . While public shaming and dogpiling is extreme , you can ’ t brush over bad thing by saying “ he wa just a kid. ” Being a kid doesn ’ t change that you have to check and change problematic behavior .
 — Faye , Chicago
 Our legal guardian influence u more than we realize , however adolescent should not be held to the same standard because we have more people around u during the day that shove their thought and belief on u . Therefore , we haven ’ t had a chance to figure out our own thought because we constantly have other people ’ s word impacting u when we don ’ t realize . It is unfair for u to compare adolescent to the standard of adult because of the countless influence adult don ’ t face , and we unrightly judge our peer because our society ha justified it a a way of life .
 — Brooklyn Waller , Bryant High School , Arkansas
 I can not say that all teenager shouldn ’ t be judged or criticized by there action and opinion . Although people can change , we can not excuse harmful behavior or opinion at any age .
 — Caroline , Northbrook
 Adolescence is a time for u teenager to be exploring the world around u and developing our worldview , and throughout this process of growing up , I have witnessed the ideology of my peer and I develop in nuance and maturity … Knowing the severity of digital shaming and the potential of teenager to change , I do not believe it is fair to hold teenager ’ s online statement to the same level of scrutiny a adult a criticism online ha a greater danger of hurting a teenager or promoting dogmatism instead of fostering growth .
 — Rachel Sweningson , Bryant , Arkansas
 It is commonly said that teenager are young and dumb and are just exploring their value and belief , but at what point doe that turn from exploration to being disrespectful without having to be held accountable for one ’ s action . I do believe that people should be held accountable for rude action a a teenager , because those action do not go away or change , they are just there , sitting in the past .

 To be a teenager in the modern era is still like being a teenager , you ’ re awkward , scared , and harassed for doing something different . The key difference is that now complete and total stranger are harassing teen now too , all thanks to the internet . I do fear being shunned for what I believe , a would any human . As such , I do try to be more thoughtful toward others . I worry so much that i might offend someone to the point i may just not talk .

 The good and the bad of “ call-out culture ”
 I ’ m sure you ’ ve heard the saying “ if at first you don ’ t succeed , try , try again. ” Think about all the time you ’ ve made mistake , and how you ’ ve learned from those mistake . What if you never got the chance to “ try , try , again ? ” If the first time you made a mistake that wa the only impression people had of you and you didn ’ t get the chance to learn and grow ? That is what public shaming is doing to u .
 Since we Iive our life so publicly , impulsively tweeting and posting whatever come to our mind , a lot of our mistake and not-so-proud moment are out there for the world to see—forever . Then our mistake become the only view people have of u , an out-of-context snapshot that provides an incomplete , biased view of our character . Even if what we say doesn ’ t go viral , it just a google search of our name away . We don ’ t get the chance to explain ourselves , to grow and change a a person , or to develop our view and opinion because people will judge u before we ’ ve had the chance .

 Criticism is a big part of online culture , and for a very good reason . People will almost always want to say something about everything , and the allure of doing so without giving away your identity is often too strong to resist . Criticism , therefore , is very important , and I believe all people have the right to criticize and to be criticized . However , I believe that all criticism should be nuanced .
 — Thomas D. , J.T . Hoggard High School
 I am definitely more careful about what I post online because I know that it could offend or upset other people , which I don ’ t want to do . I think if people were kinder online in their critique , then the teenager who posted something would be able to learn from it . However , usually the shaming is a complete bash of the person which could deter them from ever sharing again . This doesn ’ t help them learn anything ; it just hurt them and make them fearful . Kinder critique and proper guidance for people would help them learn and change to become better people .
 — Maddy Chen , Northbrook , IL
 If we ob over people ’ s past then it ’ s possible they will be afraid to ever express themselves for fear of it coming back to haunt them … I purposefully don ’ t put anything controversial online because I know it will be permanent , and in case I change a a person later in my life I don ’ t want to have to worry about that . I think that it ’ s good for people to know that thing they say on the internet can come back for them , but I also think it ’ s dangerous to have a culture where we immediately condemn people for part of their past we find .
 — Dylan Thiessen , Hoggard High School , Wilmington , NC
 I believe that the best way to counteract this problem is to simply work to persuade others rather than persecute them . There ’ s always a chance that someone could change , like Kanner did , and come to see your point of view . But forcing idea upon others , even if they ’ re right , can mar your argument in the eye of someone else , making all debate pointless . In conclusion , while it may seem that our rage-based internet culture is working to make progress , it might be hurting more than helping .
 — Ashley Anderson , Hoggard High School , NC
 Public shaming force an artificial change in people who want to avoid being the subject of constant harassment . For example , look at how argument for Trump ’ s border wall play out . If you argue for the wall , you ’ re publicly shamed and called a racist bigot . So , to avoid that outcome , people ( specifically teenager , who are generally more worried about their public image ) stay silent . Silence may feel good at the time , but silence doesn ’ t solve problem .
 Digital public shaming not only stunt the growth of the teenage mind and idea , it also stunt the growth of fruitful and equal discourse on emotionally charged issue . Overall , I don ’ t want to live in a culture where idea can be moderated through public harassment via social medium ; regardless of what I agree and disagree with , no one should have to be afraid to share their opinion to the general public .
 — Alex Mohler , Bryant High School
 … As a teenager growing up in a society like this , I agree that it restricts growth in a lot of way . Ever since seeing hate comment left on video a an eleven year old , I ’ ve had a lingering fear of having any social medium presence , to avoid confrontation for a post I made or a comment I left . Due to this , I believe some part of my growth ha been stunted ; I ’ m often too scared to put myself out in the world because I believe backlash will be inevitable . I ’ m scared that I will upset someone , somehow . If I ’ m always worrying about pleasing everyone , when will I ever learn what I believe is right or wrong ?
 — Michelle Lamas , Hoggard High School , Wilmington , NC
 I believe that people can change , because I know that my view on multiple topic have changed over the course of month or year just based on the fact that I have become more knowledgeable on those topic . A large part of changing your view and even developing new idea come from listening to what other people have to say and communicating your idea with those people .

 In “ How We Apologize Now , ” Lindsey Weber writes about the growing phenomenon of digital apology from celebrity . This inspired u to ask student about how they apologize now that we live in a world where we spend much more time connecting with people online than we do face-to-face .
 Their response were mixed . Some said an apology is meaningful only if it ’ s made in person , while others argued that , in today ’ s digital world , an apology is an apology , no matter how you do it . They also shared helpful do and don ’ t for saying you ’ re sorry .
 A sincere and meaningful apology should be made in person
 I believe new technology have made apology le significant now too . A sincere apology should be given in person . If you are really sorry you should go look the person in the eye , admit to your mistake , and tell them you will try to change or not repeat the hurtful action . I believe digital apology just don ’ t get the point across . The offended person will still be hurt and the offender can ’ t seen the person ’ s emotion that they have hurt .
 — Anonymous , Siskiyou County
 One thing that make an apology sincere , Is when it come straight from the person mouth who is giving the apology . In my opinion apologizing over a screen is like breaking up with someone over text message , disrespectful and insincere . Although I can understand were each famous person is coming from when they are trying to apologize to million , A video , or a live chat would be better then a caption or a screenshot from one note … Because apology determine the trust we are receiving from a person , and how strong our relationship is . I would never sacrifice a strong relationship , because I wrote the apology over note .
 — Isabella Clucas , Hoggard High school , Wilmington NC
 Honestly , I think digital apology take away the point of and apology . An apology is to show sincerity in how sorry you are that something happened ; it ’ s supposed to be from the heart , showing you actually care about the subject.I ’ ve received plenty of digital apology , but I haven ’ t accepted many . It just tell me you don ’ t care enough about me to come to me in real life and exclaim your “ sorrow ” . Fixing a friendship , to me , is worth more effort than a text that took ten second to type and send .
 — Alexandra Pechlivanidis , Hoggard High School
 I have received many digital apology over the year and personally , for me , changed my view of the person who wa apologizing to me . I am a very shy introverted person , so talking to people in person is hard for me . So , when I see someone taking their time to come up and apologize to me in person , I have a little more respect for them and I acknowledge the fact that they stepped out of their comfort zone . It make me feel good about myself because it show that this person obviously care about me . This is not only benefiting you but also the person that is apologizing to you . They feel a sense of satisfaction that they wouldn ’ t receive when shooting an apology through text . With today ’ s society , it is getting so much harder for people to communicate face to face . By apologizing in person I believe this will make our generation stronger , and bring u all closer together .

 Digital apology are acceptable — most of the time
 Of course , little apology like , “ I ’ m sorry I ripped your paper ” or “ I didn ’ t mean to step on your foot ” are reasonable one to be digital . But big apology like , “ I ’ m sorry I yelled at you earlier ” or “ I shouldn ’ t have lied ” should be genuine , and therefore given in person . I feel like in this world , more often than not , apology are being digitally normalized . But I think we can all agree that ’ s not a great thing to normalize .
 — Sierra , Etna
 Personally , I have given my friend many digital apology . I have a problem with confrontation and I can never find the confidence to speak to my friend about problem face on . I can definitely say it pretty obvious this way to tell when someone isn ’ t actually sorry … Face to face apology are always best , but the start with a digital apology is a good way to begin .
 — Abigail Billings , Hoggard High School , Wilmington , NC
 I personally apologize digitally because when I ’ m apologizing , I ’ m normally apologizing to one of my friend in my age group . And we understand each other better digitally . I do tend to use emojis a well when I apologize to show my regretness or whatever . BUT when I ’ m apologizing to someone like my parent , then I apologize face to face . In certain situation other alternative could be taken . Personally apologizing digitally is more easier and better .
 — Oscar , Florida
 In the past , I ’ ve both given and received digital apologize , a most people nowadays have . It is not right and not just to call these apology wrong , or worse than any other form like a face to face one . At the end of the day , it ’ s all just preference and overthinking whether or not someone is going to think that you are scared of facing your wrong and apologizing . But you are not , you ’ ve done it , and got the same message across in a more convenient way for the both of you , or at least that ’ s what most people believe in today , and do every single day . A good apology need to face the wrong that you have done , and state how you are going to improve from here on out , becoming a better person each day .
 — Bogdan Taran , Northbrook , IL
 The best apology are heartfelt and well thought out such a the one in the article . These noticeably took time , editing and most importantly sincerity . More people should write apology letter in a Notes app . This is a great starting place for developing apology , creating more well-defined and concise message due to the revision process . Like mentioned in the article , Taylor Swift , Drake , and Pete Davidson are the celebrity that use Notes app but didn ’ t screenshot a picture . They used the app a a starting point and then created the apology with clear thought and intention .
 — Kathryn Meehan , Hoggard High School , Wilmington , NC
 Hiding behind a screen
 Like so many listed , I have to admit that I am guilty of this . I think that most apology that are delivered digitally aren ’ t done so because they aren ’ t genuine , but because it ’ s so much easier to ask for forgiveness from the comfort of your couch , hiding behind a screen . When you ’ re face-to-face with that person , you either get too embarrassed to admit your mistake , or you ’ re too scared that it won ’ t be accepted . Somehow , whether it be to an offer of forgiveness or a dating request , people fear a corporal rejection more than a digital one , which encourages them to send these message from a screen .
 — Diya Jain , New Jersey
 “ Sorry. ” Receiving that from a bubble over text ha never relieved me from whatever situation led to it . I ’ ve always preferred an in-person apology , but I VERY rarely get those now . Living in the social medium age ha taken such a toll on the quality of our conversation that many are uncomfortable having in-person conversation . These awkward feeling towards face-to-face convos cause u to resort to typed character on a screen to let out our thought and feeling . However , this method of communication is very dangerous …
 Our mind receiving that text can pick apart every detail . “ Why did he capitalize that ? ” “ She put a period … she ’ s obviously mad ! ” While the person on the other end may have had no intention to send off “ negative vibes. ” Then , the argument begin : “ Why are you mad at me ? ” So many argument can be prevented with a phone call . Talking face-to-face allows for optimum communication . If I ever got into a situation with a person that ended in them having to apologize , I would 100 % prefer a phone call or to be apologized to in person because one , it ’ s way more personal , and two , it give me the peace of mind that they are being genuine .
 — Emma Coleman , Hoggard High School , Wilmington , NC
 The only struggle with apologizing face to face is sometimes it can be very nerve racking , and for some people who are not very social it can seem almost impossible to do . I think that is why so many apology are sent through text . But I also think that for some people it is tough to face the truth . Most of the kid in our generation now do everything through their phone so that they can hide . They don ’ t want to feel the agony of being wrong so they apologize through text or phone call . But like I said earlier , the most genuine and most heartfelt way to apologize in my opinion is in person , and then after just shoot them a text just to tell them how sorry you are .
 — Trey Clucas , Hoggard High School
 The do and don ’ t of saying you ’ re sorry
 I think admitting that you made a mistake and then explaining what you are going to do to not make it again , really leaf no room for the apologizee ( forgive my phrasing ) to be mad , at least at the apology.In short , if you want an effective apology , start by acknowledging what you did wrong , explain what you will do to NEVER do this again , and finish by passive-aggressively insulting the one you are apologizing to for being so sensitive . The last part ha … mixed result .
 — Justin Pfeifer , Hoggard Highschool Wilmington , NC
 I think that the best apology are when the offender realizes what they have said ha caused offense and they are genuinely sorry for being insensitive . With the observance of their offence , they now know not to do or say whatever it is they did that caused a negative reaction . A lot of people don ’ t care if they offend people , their apology are in genuine and they continue offending others , making no change .
 — Dana Mormando , Hoggard High School , Wilmington NC
 An apology should consist of recognition of wrongdoing , and an expression of remorse for the event . Bad apology are not sincere and often take the approach of blaming anything but self . Many time the wrongdoer will even guilt the recipient to make themselves feel better …Apologies are of importance because they can build and strengthen a relationship when an individual can take responsibility for their shortcoming or mistake . It show the love and respect one ha for another when they can admit to their flaw , and hopefully aim to improve themselves . It can be corrosive , though , if one is only giving excuse or continuously having the same problem , promise to change , and producing no growth .

 On one school trip , a certain classmate of mine relished in taking every opportunity to make joke at my expense or insult me . In addition , all the boy had to collectively sleep in the same area , including me and him . After dark , he would talk and talk about how stupid or how uncapable I wa without relenting for all the others to hear — it wa probably the worst couple day of my life .
 Fortunately , the counselor overheard him and asked him to stop . After a few day , the kid walked up to me and handed me a crumpled piece of paper silently . It read , without punctuation , something along the line of , “ i am sorry that you didn ’ t feel like you were at the center of your friend group it ’ s not like I wa trying to make you feel bad or anything ” . He then reverted to , “ the age-old tendency [ of getting ] defensive , blowing out what should be a simple ‘ sorry ’ into a long and winding tale of excuse ” ( Weber ) . For me , it wa an insult to receive that “ apology ” . It wa fairly obvious that he had been forced to write it by the counselor and in his own way , he rebelled by making it a emotionally and grammatically inept a possible .

 I think the best apology are shown through action rather than word and that ’ s why voicing your plan to change for the better make apology better . If a celebrity say their going to educate themselves after making a racist remark , for example , they should ACTUALLY DO IT , and not just for show .

 Apologizing for something you ’ ve done wrong , is very vital to a good relationship . Whenever I verbally hurt one of my friend , usually due to stress or carelessness , I try my hardest to let them know I didn ’ t mean what I said . Most of the time I say something wrong to my friend , it ’ s usually because I am stressed out and don ’ t think that what I say and how I say it will affect anyone . We all have our bad day and sometimes when thing aren ’ t going our way , we resort to taking it out on people we are closest to . That ’ s why it is important to make right what you ’ ve done wrong and apologize .

 Our most popular Picture Prompt of the week , “ Tech Gadgets , ” invited student to use their imagination to begin a short story or poem inspired by the above illustration .
 Many played off the same theme : the future . From a poem about how “ the future is made ” to tale of time travel , apocalypse and robot , each of these creative piece left u wanting to know what would happen next .
 What the future might be
 The projection of what the future might be , Are only based on our current reality , The future is made not by one view , But is an evolution of idea all rolled into one , So the image you hold inside of your head , Of the gadget , widget or thingy mibobs , Are merely a potential fragment of what will become .

 Masterpiece
 It wa finally finished . The master cube . So much could be created with this masterpiece . It wa amazing . It had created my new robodog almost instantly . Simply enter a blueprint and it becomes reality . My bos wa really insistent on getting this project finished , even more so than usual . He must be excited for the thing he can create . I know he ha some blueprint already ready to go . I got up off the generator and packed up my tool into my bag . “ Khanaki-1 , guard the camp until I return ” I say to my robodog , slinging my bag over my shoulder and picking up the cube gingerly . The metal dog get up from his resting place and start pacing the perimeter of my camp , watching over my generator and other possesions . “ Good boy ! ” I say with a grin . He work perfectly .
 I head out to my boss camp which isn ’ t too far . I see he ha guest so I enter his huge office quietly , knowing he will want to know of this immediately . “ — should be done any day now . Once we have the master cube we can simply give it the blueprint and it will generate our nuclear weapon arsenal to tenfold what it is now . No one will ever stand up to u again ! ” I overhear my bos say a I walk in . I suddenly want to turn around and walk right back out of this room . But I couldn ’ t , they had seen me . “ Ah , Rikki , so nice of you to join u . And with the cube no le . Is it finished ? ” My bos had turned to me with a small smile , but his eye were ice cold . A few people moved to block my exit . I wasn ’ t leaving .

 The incident
 It had been a while since Shana had any type of human interaction . She wa left behind in the wreckage of the city that wa built mainly of technology … but did that really matter now ? Shana wa ten when the incident happened , but a the year progressed , she lost track of her age . It wa almost like the day before technology . Except for one thing . Her robot-dog , Robotus .
 He wa the only thing left . Her family … who knew what happened to them . The only memory Shana had of her previous life wa living in the outskirt of the advanced city , barely living off of whatever scrap her poor parent brought back every other night . For such an advanced society , it seemed that Shana ’ s family wa always left behind . And finally … when the incident happened … escape shuttle only rescued the wealthiest of society ; royal , if you will , and everyone that wa related to important people of important blood .
 The rest were left to fend for themselves . Like Shana and her family . While her parent were out searching for food that night ; the night of the accident ; Shana tried to escape . And she managed to escape unscathed . But her parent … she never saw them again . The remains of the city appeared like a wasteland , and many piece of technology were left behind . Shana felt in her heart her parent weren ’ t completely gone , and that ’ s why instead of counting the day until death , she would slowly build a vehicle to escape . And … possibly rescue her parent . If they were alive .

 Going back in time
 This woman is a time traveler , and she is sitting on a box next to all of the thing she ha collected throughout time . Right now she is playing with a cube she got in 4000 . After she traveled to far into time , all the people on earth were gone and she couldn ’ t figure out how to go back in time . Finally she ha collected all of her thing in one pile and is trying to figure out a way to go back into time .

 The making of Earth
 The cube hovered patiently , glowing . How long had it been since she started ? Seven day ? More ? It wa hard to remember . All she knew wa that it wa the next in a long , long line of failed creation . The last one she had created had burst into shard of metal and rock . The one prior had twisted in on itself , like a swirling red eye . Even more failure , and no progress .
 She turned to her only companion , who sat idly by . He never said much , only speaking word of comfort when she felt lost . He had been with her through this entire endeavor . He wa the only one that trusted in her experiment . The rest of them called her crazy , screaming that it would never work . Give up your dream ! It ’ s not worth it !
 She sighed , releasing the upper corner of the cube . It ’ s color shifted , a subtle green replacing some of the tranquil blue . Would this one work ? How would she know ? Whispers of failure echoed in her mind , but she persisted . She had to . It wa what she wa born to do .
 As the day turned to night , she made her final touch . Standing back , the cube wa now a beautiful display of light and color . It wa good . Her heart swelled . This might be the one !
 She smiled at her friend . “ What do you think we should call this one ? ”
 Her companion didn ’ t respond , instead walking to her side to marvel at her newest creation .
 ” No suggestion ? ” She tapped her thick glass , deep in thought . “ Hmm … Let ’ s call this one … ”
 “ Earth . ”

 The floating orb
 “ This wa Log Date 6.17.2053 . Signing out for today ” . The woman with goggles said into her recording device a her companion walked beside her .
 “ When are we going to find something interesting ? Like a satellite to space or something . We have been searching for a couple of week and still found nothing. ” She signed out , feeling the flow of air glide between her teeth . The dog , only having few response , barked and trotted ahead .
 The girl followed her mechanical dog , pulling up a search engine on her handheld device . Her mind wa distracted which resulted in her tripping over . “ Hey ! I told you not to sto- ” The girl barked at her companion but soon stopped a she realized what she tripped over .
 It wa a floating orb . It looked like it hovered over a platform. “ Ugh , like I ’ ve seen those every spaceship wreck I ’ ve been too. ” She remarked with sarcasm .
 Signing out , she went to search for her dog . Just a she did , the girl heard the dog ’ s robotic bark . Interested to see what stirred the dog , she walked over . Her eye widened and sparkled with excitement .
 “ Hello ….whst cna I help yuo wi.. ” The floating cube ’ s speech wa mangled and hovered over the head of the dog. “ Aww you poor thing ! Your auditory system are down ! ” She plopped down on a rectangular box and activated her glove . She could barely contain herself a she scanned the cube for it technologically advanced feature .
 “ Let me fix you . Then you can join our fray and make this journey exciting ! ”

 In the barely inhabited steppe of Central Asia , it is establishing the next foothold in it trillion-dollar campaign to transform global infrastructure .
 In the barely inhabited steppe of Central Asia , it is establishing the next foothold in it trillion-dollar campaign to transform global infrastructure .

 The Eurasian Pole of Inaccessibility is a striking name for an absence . It is the point farthest from a sea or ocean on the planet . Located in China just east of the border with Kazakhstan , the pole get you a good distance from harbor and coastline — at least 1,550 mile in any direction — into an expanse of white steppe and blue-beige mountain that is among the least populated place on earth . Here , among some of the last surviving pastoral nomad in Central Asia , nestled between two branch of the Tian Shan range on the edge of Kazakhstan , the largest infrastructure project in the history of the world is growing .
 About 80 mile from the Pole of Inaccessibility , just across the border in Kazakhstan , is a village called Khorgos . It ha spent most of it existence on the obscure periphery of international affair , and it official population is just 908 . But over the last few year , it ha become an important node of the global economy . It is part of an initiative known informally a the new Silk Road , a China-led effort to build a vast cephalopodic network of highway , railroad and overseas shipping route , supported by hundred of new plant , pipeline and company town in dozen of country . Ultimately , the Belt and Road Initiative , or B.R.I. , a the project is more formally known , will link China ’ s coastal factory and rising consumer class with Central , Southeast and South Asia ; with the Gulf States and the Middle East ; with Africa ; and with Russia and all of Europe , all by way of a lattice of land and sea route whose collective ambition boggles the mind .
 Khorgos is a flagship project of this work in progress , an international shipping hub and free-trade zone that it promoter say is poised to become the next Dubai . Thanks to it location at the junction of the world ’ s soon-to-be-largest national economy and it largest landlocked country , Khorgos ha become an unlikely harbinger of the interconnected planet : a zone fully enclosed by the logic of globalization , where good flow freely across sovereign border , following corridor designed to locate every human being on the planet within a totalizing network of producer and consumer , buyer and seller .
 [ Read about China ’ s $ 1 trillion plan to shake up the economic order . ]
 Such victory of the global and industrial over the local , isolated and rural are heralded a the inevitable future — if there is to be a future — of our specie . What would that future look like ? Whom would it benefit ? What would it cost ? To find out , last July I caught a sleeper train from Almaty , Kazakhstan ’ s largest city , to the Chinese border , where I woke up in a train yard surrounded by desert .
 Khorgos is one of a cluster of village encircling a former trading post of the ancient world called Zharkent . From Zharkent , I hoped to arrange a ride to the border . Frescoes of camel caravan flanked the entrance gate on Silk Road Avenue . In a central square stood a rainbow-colored mosque with the sweeping eaves of a Chinese pagoda and an inscription in Uighur enjoining visitor not to forget their past . Next to the mosque wa the warren of chopped-up shipping container that serf a Zharkent ’ s central market . Taxi driver hung unhopefully around the watermelon stand .
 Among the driver wa a farmer named Nunur , who had come to Kazakhstan from China in 1962 , when he wa a young boy and Kazakhstan wa a Soviet Socialist Republic . That year , more than 60,000 Chinese Uighurs and Kazakhs escaped to the Soviet Union , crossing with Soviet passport they received from the consulate in Xinjiang and with the apparent cooperation of Chinese border guard . Nunur remembered his parent walking him over red hill at night toward the checkpoint at Khorgos . “ They opened the border and let u go into Soviet territory , ” he recalled . There were rumor that his relative who stayed behind were imprisoned or killed . ( Nunur , fearing trouble from the authority , asked that I use only his first name . ) His parent , who had raised wheat in China , found work on a collective farm . His mother became a cook while his father learned to drive tractor and Nunur to repair them . He became an expert mechanic . “ I ’ m a master without a diploma , ” he said .
 I asked Nunur to drive me to a place near the border where we could take in the booming hub of Khorgos at a glance . On the way , we passed his cornfield , apportioned to him after the breakup of the collective farm . Even a Kazakhstan modernized following it 1991 independence , growing rich by regional standard from the sale of oil and outfitting a new capital city with glossy architectural marvel , the eastern border with China remained sparsely developed , it economy dominated by livestock and grain production . Nunur said his village still had no indoor plumbing , and a we left his field we passed some of the ruin of centralized planning the Soviets left behind : a former winery , a shuttered milk plant .
 China ’ s plan are significantly more ambitious , and they reach far beyond eastern Kazakhstan . The “ belt ” of the B.R.I . refers to the Silk Road Economic Belt , a tangle of rail and highway route currently vining their way untidily across the continent from eastern China to Scandinavia . The “ road ” is the Maritime Silk Road , a shipping lane that will connect Quanzhou to Venice , with prospective stop along the way in Malaysia , Ethiopia and Egypt . To date , at least 68 country , accounting for nearly two-thirds of the planet ’ s total population , have signed on to bilateral project partly funded by China ’ s policy bank and other state-owned enterprise . Chinese firm are building or investing in new highway and coal-fired power plant in Pakistan , port in Greece and Sri Lanka , gas and oil pipeline in Central Asia , an industrial city in Oman and a $ 6 billion railway project in Laos , which in 2017 had a G.D.P . of le than $ 17 billion . China ’ s port holding stretch from Myanmar to Israel and from Mauritius to Belgium . It ha spent an estimated $ 200 billion on B.R.I . project so far , mostly in Asia , and ha implied it will spend a total of $ 1 trillion on hundred of project around the world in the coming year , dwarfing the Marshall Plan by roughly an order of magnitude . When the investment from all the participating country are combined , the estimated cost rise to $ 8 trillion .
 The B.R.I . is so big and multifarious that describing it can feel like trying to narrate the weather condition of the entire planet . Some individual component span hundred of mile and are themselves dauntingly complex and international , like the $ 68 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor , or the stalled and scandal-mired Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Corridor . Taken a a whole , the B.R.I . is unfathomable . But I had heard that , at Khorgos , a pioneering outpost , I could get closer than anywhere else to appreciating the scope of it aspiration .
 Nunur drove me through his village to an overlook within view of a border sentry post , a few mile from the spot where he crossed into Kazakhstan almost six decade before . We parked near a small rock-crushing plant above a valley of bright green cornfield . Beyond the field , through a blue haze , I could see this improbable new crossroad of the global economy .
 The Chinese side of the border wa easiest to spot . Since 2014 , an instant city of 100,000 people , also called Khorgos ( sometimes spelled Horgos ) , ha appeared ; it dark high-rise glittered in the sun . The Kazakh side of the border wa le impressive from afar , but I knew it now hosted a first-of-its-kind free-trade zone , opened on territory shared with China . Behind a copse of cypress tree , I could also make out the gantry crane of the new dry port — an inland shipping-and-logistics hub for freight train — that began operating in 2015 and could soon be the largest port of it kind in the world . Adjacent to the dry port wa a nascent railroad company town , and other plot nearby were cleared for factory and warehouse to be staffed by some of the future resident of the city of 100,000 that , if all go a planned , will soon rise to match the one across the border .
 [ The Times ’ s special report on how China became a superpower . ]
 The manager of the plant wandered over . He asked whether we wanted to get through the checkpoint , beyond which wa the last village in Kazakhstan and , beyond that , China .
 We got back in the car and pulled up to two guard who stood at the gate , rifle slung over their shoulder . They looked young and bored . The manager shouted the name of one of them , who walked shyly up to the passenger-side window . It seemed a if everyone in town knew everyone else .
 “ Give me some sunflower seed , ” the manager said . The guard pulled a bag from his pocket and poured seed into the manager ’ s cupped hand until it overflowed . The manager explained that we wanted to see China . The guard shrugged and raised the boom gate .
 Two mile beyond the checkpoint , across a valley of farmland , a tangerine ridge signaled the start of China ’ s largest territory , Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region . The border wa somewhere in the valley beneath u . If we kept going , we would arrive at the Chinese sentry post we could just make out at the top of a train of switchbacks . We didn ’ t test it , however . In recent year , the Chinese government ha erected the most advanced police state in the world in Xinjiang , targeting the region ’ s Turkic Muslims , especially it Uighur ethnic group , who make up about half the region ’ s population . As part of what Chinese Communist Party literature describes a “ de-extremification ” effort to combat terrorism , authority have created an exclusion zone of state surveillance , arbitrary mass internment , brainwashing and torture that cover an area more than four time the size of Germany and includes a population almost a big a Australia ’ s . According to the United States State Department , between 800,000 and two million people , or up to 15 percent of Xinjiang ’ s Muslim population , have been incarcerated in a growing network of more than 1,000 concentration camp .
 You couldn ’ t see any of that from our perch at the border . Everything looked peaceful . To our left , a shepherd ’ s path ascended into white-capped mountain where herdsman grazed sheep and cattle in summer , far above the field of corn and sunflower . To our right , beyond the ridge , the high-modernist future of international commerce wa springing up out of the ground . You could squint and imagine you were looking at a time-lapse photo of the entire history of collective human activity , from the first wandering goat-herder all the way to the present .
 China ha never released any official map of Belt and Road route nor any list of approved project , and it provides no exact count of participating nation or even guideline on what it mean to be a participant . But this fuzziness may be one of it defining advantage . Rather than a list of megaprojects and bilateral deal , some of which might stumble or fail , the B.R.I . can be understood a a vaguely visible hand guiding all the interlocking development in infrastructure , energy and trade where China play any kind of role .
 It is also a framework through which China ’ s leader can present virtually any component of it foreign policy , from a soda-ash plant in Turkey to China ’ s first foreign military base , in Djibouti , a part of a nonthreatening vision of what party representative like to call “ win win ” global development . In recent year , China ha floated several expansion of President Xi Jinping ’ s initial Belt and Road vision that make it scope seem all but limitless : the “ Digital Silk Road ” into the frontier of the virtual , the “ Pacific Silk Road ” to South America , and the Arctic-crossing “ Silk Road on Ice. ” Xi himself ha meanwhile extolled the merit of globalization at Davos and worked to brand his “ project of the century ” a a natural extension of the spontaneous trade route that once laced across the Eurasian continent .
 Critics have described the B.R.I . a a new kind of colonialism or even part of a strategy of “ debt-trap diplomacy , ” seducing cash-poor country with infrastructure project that are unlikely to generate enough revenue to cover the interest on the loan that funded them . That is the unhappy situation at the China-funded Port of Hambantota in Sri Lanka , which the China Harbor Engineering Company took over after Sri Lanka fell behind on debt service . The Center for Global Development list eight country that face high risk of “ debt distress ” from B.R.I . project that they can ’ t afford .
 [ Read about China ’ s growing influence in Latin America . ]
 Kazakhstan is poised to play a literally central role in China ’ s plan . The B.R.I . wa first announced in Astana , at a 2013 ceremony attended by Xi and Kazakhstan ’ s longtime president , Nursultan A. Nazarbayev . At the same event , Xi and Nazarbayev also celebrated the opening of a joint gas pipeline and signed $ 30 billion worth of trade and investment agreement . Although in the past Kazakhstan ’ s economy ha tended to orbit Russia ’ s , in 2007 China edged out Russia a Kazakhstan ’ s top importer , and some critic fear that the B.R.I . is leading the country deeper into economic vassalage . “ Some people think that China is too big , ” Nygmet Ibadildin , an assistant professor of international relation at Kimep University , in Almaty , told me . “ Kazakh people want a win-win with the B.R.I. , but in these situation China win more often . ”
 Even in a country with few meaningful democratic right , there are risk to courting foreign investment . In 2016 , a proposed law that would have permitted parcel of farmland to be leased to Chinese company sparked nationwide protest , leading Nazarbayev to table the measure .
 The human right crisis in Xinjiang ha not helped China ’ s standing in Kazakhstan , either , although the Kazakh government ha been careful not to make any public statement that might alienate an important economic partner . While diplomat may be negotiating on behalf of ethnic Kazakhs in Xinjiang behind closed door — in January , the Kazakh foreign ministry announced that China would allow 2,000 ethnic Kazakhs to give up their citizenship and cross the border into Kazakhstan — the government is not letting the presence of a prison state across the border interfere with it collaboration with China .
 That may be largely thanks to the immediate economic concern of both state , not to mention a shared penchant for autocracy , but it may also owe something to the unprecedented nature of the B.R.I . In many participating country , the project ’ s very novelty seems to lend itself to gauzy optimism . In September , the Chinese state-run medium group People ’ s Daily commemorated the fifth anniversary of the B.R.I . with a music video modeled after Coca-Cola ’ s famous 1971 “ I ’ d Like to Buy the World a Coke ” TV spot . The new video featured altered lyric like “ I ’ d like to build the world a road/And furnish it with love , ” sung by smiling representative of dozen of participant nation , decked out in ruquns , hijab and dashiki . Rather than defining the initiative in any concrete way , the video slyly co-opts Coke ’ s ability to serve a empty cipher , meaning anything to anyone . Whatever it is , the B.R.I . is “ what the world need today/It ’ s the real thing . ”
 Khorgos Gateway rise out of the flat desert basin , a pale yellow moon base of crane and storage silo into which , every so often , a freight train slowly roll . A trio of rail-mounted gantry crane loomed 50 foot overhead a I arrived on a damp , overcast morning . Khorgos Gateway may be the most advanced port in Central Asia , but it retains some of eastern Kazakhstan ’ s rustic atmosphere . When I walked into the lobby of the dry port ’ s main office , a security guard wa handing out apple he had picked in his garden .
 The chief executive of Khorgos Gateway , Zhaslan Khamzin , welcomed me into a tidy office overlooking the freight yard . “ The future lie here , ” he said proudly . Khorgos wa blessed by it position in the middle of Eurasia . “ Look at a map , and you ’ ll see China on one side , Europe on the other , Russia to the north and the Caucasus and Iran to the east . Why am I pointing this out ? Precisely because 90 percent of cargo traffic to these country is currently made by sea . ”
 Since the dry port ’ s inaugural train passed through in 2015 , Khamzin said , company who manufacture good in China have begun to recognize the advantage of a modernized overland trade route across Asia . The dry port ha transferred John Deere combine to Azerbaijan , he claimed , and Hewlett-Packard part to Western Europe . He added that it may be much cheaper to ship container by sea , but it can take more than three time a long , and air transit is the most expensive by far . By contrast , a container passing through Khorgos can travel from a Chinese point of origin to Europe in about 14 day , faster than the sea and cheaper than the air . “ We ’ re going to be a central distribution point , ” he concluded . If all go well , according to company forecast , in a few year Khorgos Gateway will be the largest dry port in the world .
 Out in the shipping yard , wild dog sniffed at stacked container . It started to rain . A train had just pulled into port , and worker in yellow slicker were jogging out to meet it . Friendship between nation notwithstanding , Chinese border authority are tight-lipped about freight schedule . The port sometimes learns about an impending arrival only an hour before it appears on the horizon , whereupon a swift ballet of machine and human movement begin . A siren blared a a gantry crane began to creep toward me through the mist . The three 41-ton crane straddled six rail line — three are the wide-gauge rail that stretch across the post-Soviet world from Helsinki to Ulaanbaatar ; three are the standard gauge used in both China and Europe — and from my perspective they appeared to tower impossibly over the mountain around u . From a dangling control booth , a crane operator lowered container onto their bed with dull-eyed expertise .
 [ What the world ’ s emptiest international airport say about China . ]
 The national railway company of Kazakhstan owns 51 percent of Khorgos Gateway . The remaining 49 percent is split between two Chinese state-owned company . Khamzin viewed China ’ s participation not a economic imperialism but a proof of the port ’ s likelihood of success . The Chinese , he explained , “ are the kind of people that if they saw no commercial opportunity , they wouldn ’ t invest here . ”
 Such arrangement are le one-sided in Kazakhstan than in some of the more debt-strapped B.R.I . country , so it ’ s very unlikely that what happened in Sri Lanka will happen here . But Chinese investment have in all likelihood muffled Kazakhstan ’ s response to the crackdown in Xinjiang .
 Each train that arrives at Khorgos ha to pas through the Chinese region , which is home to 24 million people , including more than 12 million Uighurs and about 1.5 million Kazakhs . Although political unrest ha troubled the region for decade , including , in recent year , a spate of knife attack and bombing by Uighur separatist , authority in Xinjiang have responded with brutal asymmetry , rounding up hundred of thousand of Uighurs alongside thousand of ethnic Kazakh and Kyrgyz resident in a sweeping internment drive the scope of which rival Mao ’ s Cultural Revolution . Their “ offense ” range from open display of religious belief — wearing a beard , praying in public , owning a Quran or refusing to smoke or eat pork — to simply traveling with or even speaking to relative abroad . For those not yet detained , Xinjiang ha become a dystopian zone of extralegal checkpoint , patrol , GPS tracking and random home inspection .
 Some expert say the camp and other security measure are partly in reaction to the increased freight traffic across Xinjiang , much of which now come through Khorgos Gateway . “ The role of Xinjiang ha changed greatly with the B.R.I. , ” Adrian Zenz , an academic expert on China ’ s minority policy , told me . China ’ s B.R.I . ambition have transformed Xinjiang from a fringe territory into what party leader call a “ core region ” of development . That ’ s why awareness of the camp among people in place like Kazakhstan wa such an issue , Zenz said . “ It ha significant potential to cast a very negative light on the Belt and Road . ”
 After my tour of the dry port , I headed a mile down the road to Nurkent , a newly built town of low bungalow and apartment block . For all it symbolic importance , Khorgos Gateway is still a modest operation ; if it were a United States seaport , it 2018 throughput would place it somewhere around the 26th-largest in the country , beneath the port of Mobile , Ala. ; Boston ; and Gulfport , Miss . There are just 190 employee , which Khamzin said wa close to capacity , and most of them live in Nurkent , alongside railroad worker , police officer , border guard , custom official and other agent of the new frontier . Except for the cawing of crow nesting within an apartment building ’ s crumbling gable , the town wa silent . During a visit to the region in 2016 , Nazarbayev predicted the population would grow and merge with Zharkent to form a large city , but this wa hard to visualize . The site of a planned expansion wa marked by a roundabout with a tiered silver gateway — the “ 2001 ” obelisk a imagined by Frank Gehry — through whose arch I could see only an untended field of scrubland .
 As I stood looking at the archway , a car pulled up . A man in straw hat and sandal hoisted himself out of the passenger side . “ I guard this place , ” he said . He uncoiled a hose on the ground and began watering the grass around the gate . “ This is the double door to the future of Nurkent , where the city will rise up . ”
 Khorgos ’ s other major landmark is a boomtown of open border known a the International Center for Boundary Cooperation , or I.C.B.C. , which China and Kazakhstan established in 2011 about six mile from the dry port . Here it is not only the good that move freely back and forth but also the people . In this duty- and visa-free zone , Kazakh citizen willing to brave the hourlong wait at custom control are permitted to enter a walled section of the Chinese side of Khorgos across the border to buy cheap linen and electronics , and Chinese tourist may enter a walled leisure area inside Kazakhstan to buy souvenir and eat Kazakh delicacy like shashlik and laghman .
 A United Nations human right panel describes the entirety of Xinjiang a a “ massive internment camp , ” but that didn ’ t stop worker I met at the dry port from suggesting I cross into China by way of the I.C.B.C . Khorgos Gateway and the I.C.B.C . are the product of special economic development zone set up in coordination with China : industrial and commercial arena designed to foster job and investment . There are dozen of such zone within China — the first , Shenzhen , is now a megacity of more than 12 million people — but Khorgos is the first to exist partly outside China ’ s own border . That will soon change . Chinese official have announced plan to build 50 more international zone in country from Algeria to Vietnam .
 At Khorgos , the I.C.B.C . seems intended to complement the dry port ’ s vision of frictionless trade with an equivalent vision of borderless commerce , even if most Kazakhs understand the project a a wholesale depot for cheaply made Chinese good . A popular hustle among shopkeeper from Almaty is to hire one of the local who wait outside the I.C.B.C. , and who are euphemistically called “ carrier , ” to help circumvent the weight limit on import . By all account , custom official tend to look the other way .
 My state-assigned guide picked me up at my hotel in Zharkent in a sleek Mercedes sedan that he drove a if we had just robbed a bank . “ Are you nervous ? ” he asked , laughing , a we careered around a watermelon truck . His name wa Marat Abaiuly . If the I.C.B.C . wa the most important of China ’ s outpost in Kazakhstan , Abaiuly wa it ambassador , the handsome liaison to opinion maker and potential investor . He made his power known by blowing through checkpoint with a friendly honk or , if necessary , by leaping out of the car to grip the soldier on duty by the forearm .
 It wa 10 in the morning , and a line of wholesaler and hopeful carrier had formed beyond a fence topped with concertina wire . Bus driver reclined inside their open cargo hold , chain-smoking and preparing to nap through the day . Inside the customs-control building , a construction worker wa destroying the tile floor with a jackhammer . Improvised line formed around the rubble .
 China is said to be spending billion of dollar building up it side of Khorgos . By contrast , Kazakhstan ’ s share of the I.C.B.C . is mostly a dream of the future . Projects like a constellation of luxury hotel , a sport complex and a Disneyland-style theme park called Happy Land Khorgos have languished for lack of funding . Fields of rubble and stalled construction project are scattered among the few small retail building and the yurt-shaped gift shop that are the Kazakh side ’ s most distinctive feature .
 In recent year , the name Khorgos ha instead become synonymous among Kazakhs with smuggling ring and high-profile corruption case . In 2011 , authority arrested the head of custom at Khorgos a part of a larger takedown of a $ 130 billion smuggling ring . In 2016 , the former head of the I.C.B.C . wa caught on tape accepting a $ 1 million bribe for a construction bid . Locals do not tend to figure in these public scandal , but based on the crowd I saw in front of the border checkpoint , informal gray-market carrying at Khorgos seems to have replaced animal husbandry a the region ’ s main line of work . “ Most local work at the I.C.B.C . carrying cargo , ” the chief executive of an Almaty-based truck transport company later told me , describing the work a a kind of pseudolegal smuggling . “ That ’ s how they make money . ”
 Abaiuly arranged for an I.C.B.C . van to drive u across the open border into China , where the main attraction for visiting Kazakhs are four large , windowless mall . The mall are honeycombed with shop where woman of all age and a few older men sell underwear , electronics and an array of other inexpensive product under fluorescent light . One mall wa dedicated entirely to fur coat , a gift of ritual significance in Kazakhstan , particularly between in-law at wedding . It wa early , and there were no customer anywhere . Floor after floor of identical shop stood empty , their rack of odorless pelt doubled and tripled by wall-length mirror .
 Some worker I met were Chinese citizen from Xinjiang . I had heard that , in some town , even talking to a journalist is considered ground for detention , so I didn ’ t say much , and I wa relieved to come across an outspoken furrier from Kazakhstan , Zhannur Erkenkyzy , who had worked at the border for six month . She got the job because she could speak Chinese , Russian , Uighur and Kazakh . She wa also the store ’ s model , she said , and she showed me her Instagram page , on which she appeared nestled inside the fur of mink , fox and beaver , although at the moment she wa wearing no fur at all , just a black cocktail dress that reflected no light .
 Erkenkyzy said she worked seven day a week unless she happened to ask for a day off . The time involved in crossing the unpredictable border meant that the job occupied most of her waking life , of which one highlight wa catching thief . “ When we see a shoplifter , we put on red armband and beat them with stick , ” she said excitedly . Abaiuly interrupted , whispering in low , snappy Russian : “ Why are you saying such nasty stuff about u to the reporter ? ”
 Back on the Kazakh side , we wandered the yurt , which were staffed by Chinese clerk who spoke no Russian or Kazakh . Tourists were milling about inside one of them , browsing row of instant coffee , jade egg and taxidermic hawk and antelope . Outside , a row of golf cart and one stretch limousine waited to take the tourist back . I watched a group of woman in ankle-length skirt cross a moonscape of rock , heading toward China and dragging uselessly wheeled luggage behind them . When I asked Abaiuly about the prevalence of the carrier , he smiled . “ On that subject I can not speak , ” he said .
 At an outdoor restaurant , I met a shashlik cook who lived inside one of the yurt where Chinese tourist ate . He left and re-entered the I.C.B.C . once a week to stay out of legal trouble , and said it wa cheaper than living anywhere else .
 One way to read the history of Central Asia is a a record of interaction between the mounted nomad who were long the primary occupant of the Eurasian Steppe and the sedentary population who lived among them . As late a the 1930s , the dominant activity on the steppe wa pastoral : herding sheep , goat and other livestock . Herders roamed in large , shifting clan on either side of the Tian Shan and Altai range , traveling on horseback and occasionally fragmenting or forming political alliance . These nomadic horde proved unconquerable until the late 18th century , when they began to fall to Chinese conquest and , in what is now Kazakhstan , to Russian — later Soviet — rule .
 In 1929 , the leader of the Soviet Union determined that Kazakhstan ’ s pastoral work force would go to work on farm . This forced collectivization wa framed a a civilizing mission to modernize a population whom many Russians had long viewed a primitive barbarian . Land formerly devoted to grazing wa irrigated and turned over to wheat production , with the immediate result that around 90 percent of the country ’ s livestock died . The subsequent famine caused the death of one-quarter of the population of Kazakhstan and anywhere from one-quarter to one-half of all ethnic Kazakhs , a human-made catastrophe that ended nomadism a it had been practiced in the region for thousand of year . Kazakhs became a minority in the nation the Soviets had founded in their name .
 Nomadic pastoralism remains central to Kazakh mythology — Nazarbayev describes himself a “ the son , grandson and great-grandson of herder ” — but a a practice it ha retreated to the periphery of the country ’ s economy . Most of the surviving herder in this part of Kazakhstan practice a form of seminomadism known a transhumance , alternating between winter in a low-altitude village and summer in a pasture , or zhailau , in the mountain . I wondered how those in the mountain above Khorgos were reacting to the economic foment that had emerged around their winter home . One morning I visited a village of herder in the Zhongar Alatau , a northern stretch of the Tian Shan named for the last nomadic khanate to rule over the steppe of western China .
 It wa Friday , and most of the men were at the village mosque . I asked the local damkeeper ’ s son , who said his name wa Turar , to take me farther into the mountain where family graze their herd throughout the summer . I got into Turar ’ s old Lada four-wheel drive , and we rattled and bounced up the edge of a steep bank that commanded a wide prospect of sand dune and crumpled foothill . Hawks gyred overhead . I thought to myself that the beauty of Kazakhstan defied description , but Turar , who had lived here all his life , managed to capture it pristine emptiness . “ It ’ s like a screen , ” he said cryptically . Then , to clarify : “ Like a computer . Like the Windows screen . ”
 To reach the zhailau , we left Turar ’ s car at the dam where his family control the flow of snowmelt and mountain spring through a Soviet-era irrigation canal . Before long , we arrived at an emerald slope where a single yurt sat embosomed in alpine lushness . Turar said this area wa called the Black Gorge .
 A friend of Turar ’ s emerged from the yurt , blinking at the sun . His name wa Arsen Akhatay , and he ’ d been napping . Every spring , he helped drive the family livestock , a few hundred sheep and 50 cow and horse , up to the zhailau and tended them . He returned to the village when school started in the fall , leaving his parent to drive the animal back down . In between , there wa a lot of free time . Sometimes he passed it playing kokpar , a popular Central Asian sport in which player fight over a headless goat carcass while on horseback . Akhatay wa the attacker on his local team and wa meant to be at training camp this week for national , but he ’ d fallen sick instead . He surveyed his sheep without enthusiasm . Each wa labeled in resin with a large “ 5 ” marking it a a member of his family ’ s flock . A solar panel staked into the ground near the doorway to the yurt powered a Chinese-made radio and a four-inch TV set . Turar gestured farther into the gorge , where Akhatay ’ s family pastured their horse a mile or so in , and said that if you kept on in that direction , you ’ d hit China .
 Akhatay wa wearing a blue camouflage jacket , the kind worn by Kazakh police officer on field exercise . His cousin came out of the yurt wearing the same thing . During the school year they lived in a village near Zharkent called Turpan . Akhatay , who wa about to start his senior year of high school , said he did not intend to look after sheep his whole life . I asked whether he wanted a job at Khorgos .
 “ Many people from the village work at the border a carrier , ” he said . “ There are many official job but also many unofficial. ” All thing being equal , he said , he wanted an official one . When he graduated , he planned to enroll at the military institute in Almaty to become a border guard .
 On our drive down the mountain there wa nothing to displease the eye , and before long we arrived at yet another small mountain village of white birch and potato garden . Turar parked the car by a water pump and introduced me to a former classmate , a Kazakh named Zholaman Tashimkhan , who had come out to greet u .
 We sat on the curb near the pump . Like Arsen , Tashimkhan spent most of the summer up in the mountain , but he wa older and had already been drawn to the job at the border . He worked for a year for the railroad , a good job that is hard to come by through normal channel — “ I used my connection , ” he said , and laughed — but then his sister ’ s husband found him work a a carrier . “ It ’ s not an official job , ” he said . “ Not a public job . ”
 A few men from the village began to gather around the pump a we talked . Tashimkhan explained that he had worked for a wholesaler based in Zharkent , crossing into the I.C.B.C . four or five day a week to bring household product , mostly bedsheets and linen , back into Kazakhstan . He wa paid according to how much he managed to get through custom . On an average day , he might earn $ 15 or $ 20 — good money — and occasionally a much a $ 60 . Customs enforcement wa lax . “ For u , you talk to the official working there , and you just bring thing out , ” he said .
 More villager had come out to the road until they completed a circle around u . Tashimkhan changed the subject , then joked with a friend that he wa starting to think he would regret talking to me . An older man who had been pacing the street squatted down beside u and began conspicuously sharpening a sickle a few inch from my head . Turar suggested it wa time for u to continue down the mountain . We got into the Lada and drove off .
 The great commonplace of our time also happens to be true : The world is more connected than ever before . But if it is more connected , the world is also more administered — it people more coerced and surveilled , more susceptible to the design of authoritarian leader and more dependent on the fortune of mercurial international market — than at any point in human history . If the first fact ha made some part of the world freer , the second ha made the rest of it le so .
 A continuing trial at the local courthouse in Zharkent underscored this inversion , which seemed to me to lie at the heart of the development at Khorgos . The case concerned Sayragul Sauytbay , a Chinese-born Kazakh woman who had fled Xinjiang and wa requesting political asylum in Kazakhstan . Before the crackdown in Xinjiang , ethnic Kazakhs freely crossed the border to visit friend and relative . But in 2016 , a crossing became increasingly fraught , Sauytbay ’ s husband and two child decided to move permanently to Kazakhstan . Sauytbay , who wa working in Xinjiang a a kindergarten director , remained in China with plan to join them ; the rest of the family became Kazakh citizen in 2017 . For more than a year , they met only in the free-trade zone at the I.C.B.C .
 On April 5 , 2018 , without telling anyone , Sauytbay entered the I.C.B.C . with forged identity paper , then slipped into Kazakhstan by posing a a member of a tour group . A few week later , she wa arrested and charged with entering the country illegally , and then her story began to emerge . Not long after her family had left China , Sauytbay wa assigned to work at one of Xinjiang ’ s notorious detention camp . In her testimony , she described it a “ a prison in the mountain , ” with high wall and barbed wire that kept in some 2,500 inmate . She said she wa forced by authority to accept a teaching job there , indoctrinating the inmate in state propaganda , and she wa warned that the penalty for revealing any information about the camp wa death . The authority confiscated her passport .
 At her trial , Sauytbay provided some of the earliest testimony about life in Xinjiang ’ s camp . Her case made headline in Kazakhstan ’ s national newspaper . She wa married to a Kazakh citizen and wa herself a “ returnee , ” a member of the diaspora of ethnic Kazakhs the government ha been courting for year . But now prosecutor at Sauytbay ’ s trial were arguing that she should be deported back to China , where she claimed she would be arrested or even killed for having made public her knowledge of the camp .
 Most people I ’ d met in Almaty seemed to think she had little chance of receiving asylum , much le Kazakh citizenship . The acquittal rate in criminal trial in Kazakhstan is around 1 percent , and hasn ’ t changed since the day of the Soviet Union . There wa also the B.R.I . to consider . Kazakhstan might decide Chinese investment wa more important than any international agreement on refugee . It wouldn ’ t be the first time a country wa so swayed . In 2017 , Greece vetoed a European Union statement criticizing China ’ s human right record at the United Nations , a decision that critic linked to China ’ s controlling interest not just in Greece ’ s largest port but also in it public power grid . In January , China hosted a Silk Road Celebrity China Tour , inviting journalist from six B.R.I . partner country — Egypt , Turkey , Pakistan , Afghanistan , Bangladesh and Sri Lanka — on a highly choreographed tour of a “ vocational center ” in Kashgar , another famous stop on the ancient Silk Road . According to the state-run Xinhua news agency , the visitor uniformly “ praised the development and stability ” of Xinjiang . An editor from Bangladesh singled out the region ’ s contribution “ to the nonoccurrence of violence and terrorism . ”
 My last day in town coincided with what turned out to be the last day of Sauytbay ’ s trial . About 100 supporter had risen early and driven out from Almaty to the courthouse , which wa opposite a park where marble bust of Soviet hero watched over a playground . When the courtroom opened , the crowd crushed against the glass door . I made it through with a handful of other reporter thanks to some strategic shoving by a few veteran activist ; most of the crowd remained on the courthouse step .
 As the proceeding began , Sauytbay ’ s lawyer introduced into evidence a copy of the asylum application that she had just filed . Both the judge and prosecutor interrogated Sauytbay , who from behind a clear protective wall related how , when she wa arrested by the Kazakh police , an official told her that she would be sent back to China to die and her child would become orphan .
 Sauytbay freely admitted she ’ d escaped China illegally . She wa willing to serve a prison sentence . She just didn ’ t want to be sent back . “ There is no reason for me to live if I am not with my child , ” she told the judge . Her family sat across the room , near an open window through which we could hear the crowd murmuring outside .
 The prosecution had previously rejected any kind of a plea deal . So what happened next wa that rare thing : a dramatic courtroom reversal . In a closing statement , the prosecutor cited the outpouring of support the case had received across Kazakhstan . She requested that the judge allow Sauytbay to serve out a period of probation at her husband ’ s house . “ I ask you not to apply deportation , ” she said . “ I ask you to set her free in the courtroom. ” Sauytbay ’ s eye went wide . Her lawyer , who seemed stunned , agreed . A few moment later , sound of cheering rang out on the courthouse step .
 “ I wa surprised the law wa kept , ” Rysbek Sarsenbay , a prominent opposition activist , told me later . He reasoned that the government must have weighed the consequence of deporting Sauytbay carefully against the risk of alienating China ’ s leadership . “ Even a a dictatorship , ” he said , “ Kazakhstan must honor it international commitment . ”
 Once the judge issued the expected ruling — prosecutor and judge in Kazakhstan rarely disagree — Sauytbay wa ushered from the courthouse to the top of the step , where she embraced her son and thanked President Nazarbayev for his beneficence . A poet took the stage to extemporize a victory verse in Kazakh . The crowd repaired to a restaurant a few mile outside Zharkent , where a spontaneous release party began with the singing of the national anthem . Waiters descended with plate of beshbarmak , a national dish of boiled noodle and horse meat in onion sauce . When Sauytbay arrived , holding her son in her arm , everyone stood up and clapped . She told me she hoped her testimony would “ shine a light of hope ” for her compatriot in China . “ They know there is a country that will always protect them , ” she said .
 The celebration may have been premature . As Sauytbay later told The Globe and Mail of Toronto , within a day of her release , her sister and two friend were arrested in Xinjiang — they have since disappeared into camp — and in October Kazakhstan denied Sauytbay ’ s asylum claim . For the time being , she is living at home with her family , but her legal status in Kazakhstan is uncertain .
 Even if she manages to avoid deportation , Sauytbay is one of thousand of people with tie to Kazakhstan who have found themselves caught up in Xinjiang ’ s detention center . At the release party , I found myself sitting next to a Kazakh woman named Qarlyghash Ziparova , whose nephew , a former Xinjiang official named Askar Azatbek , had disappeared inside the ostensibly neutral free trade zone of the I.C.B.C . Azatbek , who had become a Kazakh citizen a few month earlier , entered the I.C.B.C . in 2017 with a friend , whereupon a group of men drove up in two car and detained them . The friend wa released , but Azatbek wa hauled off . They hadn ’ t even been on the Chinese side , the friend had said . Ziparova tried to complain to authority in Kazakhstan , but without any luck . The I.C.B.C . told her there wa no surveillance video , although she didn ’ t believe it . She didn ’ t understand how a Kazakh citizen could be taken away by China like that — without even a trial .
 The ancient Silk Road wa equal part trade route and social network . The route themselves were in constant flux and administered by no one , and they succeeded through incremental growth and local knowledge in response to changing need — the exact opposite of the Ozymandian ambition and sweeping autocratic statecraft that characterize the Belt and Road . For all it potential to create job and modernize infrastructure , the project ha also created a halo of mass internment camp for the powerless and gray-market economy for the poor . While new official job in Khorgos are lifting a lucky few out of poverty , it is far more common to find farmer and herder moonlighting a taxi driver , security guard or smuggler , part of a precarious network of low-paid freelancer . Such work is susceptible by design to sudden change in enforcement and depends on a constant influx of disposable worker . It seemed like a high cost for connecting the world .
 I hired a taxi to drive me back to Almaty . We took a new highway that opened last year , part of a growing highway system affiliated with the B.R.I . and known a the Western Europe-Western China International Transit Corridor . The highway cut the travel time in half , from six hour to just over three hour , and driving atop it felt like riding an air-hockey puck . There were no rest stop or gas station , and the few landmark I could see stood at an unobtrusive distance . They included an old train station , a pumping house for a Chinese oil pipeline and the alien form of a half-built wind farm courtesy of SANY Group , the Chinese manufacturing behemoth . As the sun became a narrow red eye on the horizon , a dust storm descended the cliff to our left and crossed the road into empty veld . There were no car in sight . It wa le a road than the idea of a road .
 The driver didn ’ t know anything about the trial whose outcome I had just seen . He had never heard of Sayragul Sauytbay . He wa happy to have such a fine new highway on which to drive his customer back and forth between Khorgos and Almaty . Kazakhstan , we agreed , wa a beautiful country . He pointed to some field he said would be full of cattle in the fall , then opened the sunroof and stuck his hand into the night air .

 It usually take a while — a decade or two — before we can look back at a particular era of American life and see it a something coherent , something whose every aspect is marked by one overarching mood . It take a certain amount of hindsight to notice how all the wildly different reaction people had to the moment were still , in the end , reaction to the same thing ; all the different pose they adopted were still being struck against the same backdrop .
 But this era — this year , and the last one , and one or two before that — might be an exception . There ’ s an oddly strong in-the-moment consensus on how everyone is feeling these day , and it is not good . At some point it became a routine conversational tic for all sort of people , of all sort of persuasion , to express , with an incredulous gesture , that thing feel a bit grueling and frantic lately , don ’ t they ? Musicians are no exception . “ Life is pretty tumultuous right now for all of u , ” said the crossover country star Kacey Musgraves , while accepting a Grammy for the Album of the Year . The Swedish singer Robyn acknowledges that “ pop at the moment is depressing ” in an interview midway through this issue . “ The music kid are listening to is heavy ! Maybe it ’ s hard to be positive and optimistic at the moment . ”
 What ’ s amazing is that the musical expression of all this isn ’ t always some big swing toward darkness , or anger , or anxiety . ( Though there is , in certain genre , plenty of all that a well . ) Read through this list , and what you ’ ll often see instead is a very earnest , very serious desire to find the right reaction to a world that feel tense and high-stakes — an ambient conviction that music should be looking for way to cope , way to protect ourselves , moment of escape , hard reckoning with our collective responsibility , idea for how to make the world feel le brutal . The 25 song and artist below include blockbuster hit , critical darling and inescapable conversation piece , but few of them take a direct route to the usual joy of pop — the song about dancing and boasting and sex and love , the one about what a fantastic night everyone ’ s about to have or what ecstasy they intend to find by the end of it . No , a lot of these song seem focused on deeper challenge : How do we get to those joy in the first place ? Who get to have them , and who deserves them ? And in one case : Which of them are worth the corresponding rise in sea level ?
 The artist do not always sound thrilled about the circumstance . ( “ The society we live in at the moment , ” Robyn say — “ we didn ’ t really make it very good , you know ? ” ) But they ’ re a lot more motivated — whether it ’ s to articulate something bleak or find their way toward something better — than you might expect .

 How aging — and the age — can change a song ’ s meaning .
 By HANIF ABDURRAQIB
 I don ’ t know if Bruce Springsteen think about death a much a I think about the inevitability of his dying . I ’ ve lived an entire life a a fan of Bruce Springsteen , which mean I have already imagined the world without him in it , and I have mourned that world . If you ’ re lucky enough to age gracefully beyond a certain point , with that aging will come an acceptance of finality or of the idea that there is going to be a darkness from which you can ’ t return . If you ’ re lucky enough to have made a life writing song or story or something at the intersection of song and story , this could mean that there come a point where you make sure people hear you clearly , one last time , before you go .
 I don ’ t know if Springsteen himself think about his life and death in this way , but the silence in “ Springsteen on Broadway ” — which ran on Broadway from Oct. 3 , 2017 , to Dec. 15 , 2018 , culminating in a soundtrack and a Netflix special — suggest he might . The space he built in between the song allow the artist to explain and give context not to just the music but also to the life built around the music . If the project of Springsteen ’ s Broadway show wa to attach history and legacy to the individual song long adored by the public , there is also something to be said about what time doe to natural storyteller . They can become more tactile with age , drawing out story that have been told several time before the most current retelling — leaving a listener with even more touchable moment than otherwise might have been asked for or sought , so that when the storyteller is long gone , there might still be fragment of his or her story that span generation .
 Of the many gripping example of this in “ Springsteen on Broadway , ” the one that stand out most memorably is the sprawling story he tell before playing his iconic ( and often misconstrued song ) “ Born in the U.S.A. ” The story center on Walter Cichon , who wa the frontman for the Motifs , a band Springsteen still considers one of the best rock ’ n ’ roll band from the Jersey Shore . In the ’ 60 , the Motifs played weekend show to room packed with teenage admirer . Cichon wore his hair long and sported pointy black boot . When he performed , he would shake out his hair and send bead of sweat flying past the stage light . For anyone who ha ever lived in any town where a band wa on the verge of “ making it , ” you know the epiphany : This band is too good to be here , in this place , in this moment . That wa the Motifs , with their frantic and warbly guitar laid below Cichon ’ s howling vocal .
 Walter Cichon wa drafted when he wa 21 and didn ’ t come back from Vietnam . He went missing in action in 1968 .
 On Broadway , Bruce Springsteen performs “ Born in the U.S.A. ” largely in silence . The song is half-spoken , half-sung , Springsteen ’ s voice rough and breaking beneath the decade of labor it ha done — labor rendered romantic through writing and performance . What ha always been true about the career of Bruce Springsteen is that he ’ s most entertaining when backed by his pal , but he ’ s most earnest when he ’ s alone . To hear “ Born in the U.S.A. ” presented without an instrument is to hear the strain that push toward the edge of anger , that hovering sentiment that wa lost in the original ’ s bombastic wall of sound and perhaps camouflaged by it imagery . At the time of the song ’ s release , Springsteen wa a young , attractive , muscular man who appeared midjump in front of an American flag on the single ’ s cover . From a zoomed-out perspective — a white musician writing about the intricacy of labor — it could seem a if he represented everything that a particular America would be proud of . The misreading of the original song wa not purely accidental : Its volume and fanfare meant that it sounded ( and still sound ) good bursting out of speaker while firework explode in the sky , and it loudest word in the chorus are about land and birthright . But with the drum and burst of keyboard gone , the relentlessly hollow hope of the song is gone , too . On the isolated stage of a theater , all that ’ s left is knowing that the singer ha loved and dreamed and lost in a country sometimes not worth loving and dreaming and losing in .
 In his long monologue introducing “ Born in the U.S.A. ” on Broadway , Springsteen talk about “ the blood and the confusion and the pride and the shame and the grace that come with birthplace , ” and I get it . There are some of u who didn ’ t ask to be born in our particular here , and there are some of u who didn ’ t ask to come to this particular here , but to be in wherever your here is mean that you might be compelled to both fight for it and forgive it . On Broadway , Springsteen mention something else : He tell the story of him and two of his friend being summoned to the selective-service office , a a prelude to being sent to Vietnam — for what , he say , “ we were sure wa going to be our funeral. ” They did everything they could to get out of being drafted , and succeeded . He end the story by exhaling softly and pausing before telling the audience : “ I do sometimes wonder who went in my place . Because somebody did . ”
 I imagine that ’ s it . To live a long enough life in a place founded , in part , on violence and volatility is to know that long life may depend on someone else walking through a door you wanted no part of . Or to know that the hero from your hometown never made it out because war got to them first . Stripped to it barest bone , “ Born in the U.S.A. ” asks a listener to recognize that human survival is not something we can count on . The song matter now in a different way than it did in 1984 , largely because of the artist behind it : Springsteen , trying to wrestle not only with the song ’ s current legacy but also with how it might be co-opted decade from now , when he won ’ t be around to make sure people understand the ache behind the song ’ s fury .

 The Ambiguous kiss-off .
 By AMANDA HESS
 ‘ Thank u , next ” is styled like a tweet , which is how the phrase first appeared — a a cryptic rebuke that Ariana Grande thumbed off in the comedian Pete Davidson ’ s general direction a few day after their breakup . Since then , the phrase ha pulsed through the culture , undulating between naughty and nice . When the song debuted , it wa revealed to be not a takedown but instead a sincere tribute to relationship past , lifting Davidson ( “ for Pete , I ’ m so thankful ” ) to the same plane a her ex Mac Miller , the rapper who died of a drug overdose last year ( “ he wa an angel ” ) . But then the video hit , and in it , Grande cosplayed a Regina George , the demon Barbie of “ Mean Girls , ” scrawling note about her ex in a burn book . But then all the thing she wrote about them were really nice ! A quick shot in the video show the apology she scrawled on Davidson ’ s page — “ sry i dipped ” — which wa secretly the most savage note of all : For the record , she dumped him .
 Online , the phrase ha bloomed into a deliciously ambiguous kiss-off , a usage modeled by Grande herself , directed toward anyone from a no-name rapper who covered the song to Piers Morgan , who criticized pop star for appearing in revealing photo shoot . Like the Southern “ bless your heart , ” the passive-aggressive nicety that sustain the entire Midwest or the chill of the British stiff upper lip , the internet ha found a discreet slight of it own in “ thank u , next . ”
 The phrase is breezily transactional . It render news anchor and ex-boyfriend into stranger , reducing them to the base level of politeness required by the social contract . It sharpens respect into a shiv . And yet it is vexing in it restraint , pre-emptively silencing any retaliatory effort .
 We are living in a time of great pettiness . A big star can grow two size by doing something very small . Bhad Bhabie chucked a drink at Iggy Azalea and cemented her status a a memetic folk hero . Pusha T lobbed a literal baby into the middle of his rap war with Drake . Grande ’ s grace could , in one reading , signal a rejection of all of this calculated cruelty , a classy subversion of the fan-and-industry expectation that a celebrity may only rise by tearing another down .
 But it ’ s also a savvy strategy for advancing the game . The next level of beef is always the high road — ascending to that rarefied realm of conflict where put-down are joined seamlessly with self-respect . In “ thank u , next , ” Grande cast her ex a steppingstones on her path to greatness , men who taught her “ patience , ” “ pain ” and , ultimately , how little she needed them . There ’ s nothing harsher than having your relationship converted into a learning experience . And the worst part is , you know she ’ s right . The secret message of “ thank u , next ” is that woman can dismiss men who sap their energy and undermine their success , and this is not an act of cruelty or a symptom of bitchiness . It ’ s a simple social nicety .

 The new R. & B . litmus test requires artist to be accessible , enigmatic and maybe a little bit flawed . Sanging is optional .
 By ANGELA FLOURNOY
 From the vocal singularity embodied in Aretha Franklin to the otherworldly dance move of Michael Jackson , black folk have long expected rigor from our R. & B . entertainer . ( We institutionalized this expectation at the Apollo Theater , where , on Amateur Night , an “ executioner ” used to chase away mediocre performer midact with a broom or a pitchfork ; now he just dance them off the stage . ) Being the best in R. & B . meant that you had a honed , real-deal ability to entertain , that you could stand on a stage and perform a remarkable act that separated you from the rest of u .
 I grew up hearing debate about the worthiness of this or that singer devolve into shouting match , the assertion that a favored artist could sing but not really sang being an affront to your system of taste and judgment . Mariah Carey wa always an easy win . In a single verse , her melismatic contralto might argue with her teasing falsetto , alternating between lower and higher note until she sounded more bird than human . In the ’ 90 , girl-next-door Mariah belted out uptempo love song on one station ; a few turn of the dial over , she sang the same record with the addition of a hip-hop verse , thereby sliding from mainstream to “ urban , ” which is to say from white to black . She straddled two coded world a a biracial person , a sometimes-fraught experience that she addressed on her 1997 song “ Outside . ”
 Her desire for cross-genre acceptance is part of what pushed her to write and arrange song for herself that few other human being could cover . Through the mid-2000s , to listen to a Mariah album , from lead single to deep cut , wa to marvel at a maximalist pulling off her excess , every run more dazzling than the last . And yet by the end of the aught , she had begun receding behind her production , talk-singing and whispering where she used to overaccentuate each phrase . The rumored loss of her voice seemed to mark the end of an era altogether .
 Few people argue over the voice of a singer the way they used to , but R. & B . is back in vogue after having spent several year in the background a E.D.M . dictated pop ’ s music imperative . Younger artist are pushing the genre forward in many respect : intriguing , pared-down personal style ( SZA ) ; forceful , nuanced messaging ( Solange ) ; swaggering vocal that don ’ t feel yoked to the rap feature ( H.E.R . ) ; and a much-needed expansion of whom a woman might be singing love song to in the first place ( Syd ) . But the term by which we expect rigor from these artist have changed , too . A voice that sound a though it were gifted from the heaven is no longer a likely predictor of critical success , though it may garner you a stint on “ The Voice. ” More important is appearing unvarnished , or idiosyncratic . Contemporary R. & B . seems to prefer the D.I.Y . ethos of indie rock or riffing on the earthy , unadorned feel of neo-soul . The preferred feel is that of a raw outpouring of emotion alone in a bedroom with a laptop . To see R. & B. ’ s newest name perform at event like the Grammys is a bit like seeing your high school gym teacher on a date — who even knew they owned fancy clothes ?
 Mariah Carey doesn ’ t seem built for this new R. & B . moment , but “ A No No , ” from her 2018 album “ Caution , ” work for all the reason we would once expect it not to . It ’ s a straightforward sample of an extremely familiar song ( a remix of Lil ’ Kim ’ s 1997 “ Crush on You ” ) . Vocally , it ’ s uncomplicated . The track ha a few elastic moment at the top of verse , but for the most part , Carey maintains a syncopated , crooning sing-speak . She come down from the vocal stratosphere to some place closer to the younger R. & B . chanteuses , but it never feel like a cop-out . “ Caution ” a a whole forgoes Carey ’ s hallmark vocal pyrotechnic , save for a few whistle tone that creep into the final note of several track . What make it different from her previous attempt at le ornate vocal arrangement is the confidence Carey exudes . She isn ’ t hiding ; she ’ s recalibrating .
 This new phase of R. & B . is one for which Mariah the songwriter is well suited . She ha always been a quick study of current trend , and a a writer on 17 of her 18 No.1 single , she proved that she knew how to make her voice fit within them . Carey posse a mischievous sense of humor ( best employed on Eminem dis track ) that is fit for our current age of trolling and lyric made for meme . In “ A No No ” she drawl out the line “ Irregardless of what transpired , ” daring the listener to think too hard about whether she know that she ha deployed a fake word ( of course she doe ) . Over the past three decade , Mariah the vocalist ha been so singular that other Mariahs went overlooked — the canny recognizer of trend , the pop star who pushed her label to make unlikely hip-hop collaboration happen and the songwriter who wa funnier than people understood . Mariah , queen of glitter and lover of glamour , might never pull off a down-to-earth visual aesthetic , but she still posse the tool to make music that embodies that feeling — and she ha had these tool for year .

 Interview by NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES
 Last year , in a span of month , Meek Mill went from solitary confinement in a Pennsylvania prison to releasing an album that debuted at No.1 on the Billboard chart . It ’ s a paradoxical narrative that ha defined the Philadelphia rapper since his teenage year , when he landed both a record deal and criminal conviction on drug and gun charge . Sentenced at 21 to prison and year of probation , the 31-year-old rapper ha spent his entire adult life in and out of court and prison , often for noncriminal violation like not adequately reporting his travel plan .
 But 2018 proved transformative . New scrutiny of the judge overseeing his probation , and of the initial case — he ha always maintained that the police made up charge — roused public support from powerful people , including Jay-Z , Philadelphia ’ s district attorney and the Philadelphia 76ers co-owner Michael Rubin . With tour date for his “ Championships ” album selling out , Mill ha become a leading voice on the failing of the criminal-justice system . Along with writing an op-ed for The New York Times and appearing on national news show , the rapper helped start the Reform Alliance , an organization dedicated to getting one million Americans out of the prison system .
 How long did you work on the album ? Probably eight month . Since I came out .
 I usually take about eight month to produce a piece a well . Then there ’ s panic — you ’ ve gone over it so many time , you can ’ t even tell anymore if it ’ s good or not . I feel the same way . Going through the music so much , not even knowing if it ’ s good anymore — I done heard it at least a thousand time , trying to analyze and look at it so many way .
 At the end of “ Championships , ” you say we had to beat the street , beat racism , beat poverty . So much of what you write is sociological , a study of the neighborhood . Your being from Philadelphia made me think about W.E.B . Du Bois in 1899 — he did a study called “ The Philadelphia Negro. ” Yeah , I read piece of it in prison . One of the older guy probably gave it to me .
 Then you know what I ’ m talking about . This wa known a the first sociological study of black Americans in the country . He wa trying to understand why black folk lived the way they lived . And the social problem he identified — poverty , crime , illiteracy , white discrimination — are the exact same thing you talk about 120 year later . That wa my life coming up , so it wa normal . I always tell people , I ’ ve been living the life I ’ m living now for the last eight year , but I ’ ve been living in the ghetto for 23 . Things we ’ ve been traumatized by our whole life — we have a right to talk about it .
 You refer to school a couple of time on this album — your mom praying you ’ d go to Yale , or going to a school with bullet hole in the locker . You said you were on the honor roll ? I used to be , until , like , third grade . There wa another book I got in prison , about black kid — the fourth grade , thing go wrong and grade start to decline . That wa my life . Mine wa because I moved to a different neighborhood , rougher than the one I came from .
 One of my favorite quote from James Baldwin is “ The kid had been told that they weren ’ t worth [ expletive ] , and everything they saw around them proved it. ” What did your school say about what society thought of you ? We used to have teacher say , “ Oh , you ’ re probably going to be dead or in jail , or you ’ re probably going to be a failure. ” I had some good teacher , too , but it wa rough in our school .
 I feel like that ’ s a message we start telling black boy very early : You ’ re going to be dead or in jail . I know we ’ re trying to warn them , but it also seems a if you ’ re dictating their future . Yeah , but I never believed that . I used to say I wa going to be a normal story of the ghetto . But if you have your mom telling you you ’ re going to be a great person and then your teacher talk to you like that — you wouldn ’ t really want to listen to that person anymore .
 Was school easy for you ? Pretty easy . I didn ’ t have to study to pas my test . Even if I ran the hallway , I would still be fairly good . Later on , when I really stopped trying , I wa put in disciplinary school . It wa like a jail . You get strip-searched before you go in , fingerprinted every day . One day I just climbed over the gate and left .
 It wa a public school organized like a jail ? In other word , it wa early conditioning for what everybody assumed your future wa going to be . When I finally went to jail , I already knew everybody . Everybody I went to school with wa in the jail .
 What were you put in that school for ? Fighting and acting up . I said in one of my rap , I wa acting up in school because I thought it wa cool , but really I wa hurt . Your mom ’ s at work , your dad ’ s in the graveyard , you ’ re not really getting nurtured , and I guess you just resort to acting up .
 You have a song called “ Trauma , ” which talk about that , the PTSD young people in these neighborhood are dealing with . But that ’ s why I love that Baldwin quote — everything about the environment tell these kid they ’ re nothing , right ? But when they react in what ’ s actually a very normal way , we want to break them down . You don ’ t value yourself because you grow up not being valued . What type of motivation do you get if your mom is on drug ? Your self-esteem is automatically just low . Some people have the determination to shoot to the top . But , you know , that ’ s not normal — for just a regular kid to have the determination to do that .
 I always say anger is an easier emotion to deal with than pain . Yeah . That ’ s why I say , you come through neighborhood and you see kid with their face all balled up or looking angry ? They ’ re probably really angry . His mom is probably really on drug , and he probably really don ’ t have food in the house , and his dad is probably really dead . They hurt , they torn , they scarred . It ’ s nothing that word can really fix . “ Why is this kid always angry ? ” Well , he ’ s been through something .
 Who ’ s the first black writer you ever read ? I ’ d never be able to determine who wa black and white when I wa reading back then . I don ’ t know the first . “ The New Jim Crow ” — that ’ s a black writer ?
 Yes . Michelle Alexander . When you were in high school , you weren ’ t exposed to black literature , black writer ? I went to public school . The book were falling apart . They probably still got the same book from when I wa in school . We didn ’ t get no black literature in public school .
 I read a lot a a child , mostly because I wa grounded all the time . Then we had a black-studies course in high school , and I became obsessed with black history because it felt like , for the first time , the world made sense . You would see your community and how people lived , and they would tell you we just did not want better . But I could see how hard people worked , and they still could not get ahead . Studying history calmed me . The most I ever read wa in prison . There ’ s nothing to do , so you turn to book . Reading made me process the system . Sometimes I thought it wa just million of black people , and Spanish — when you come to prison , it ’ s black and Spanish . Looking deeper , and seeing the way some of those thing are broken down in “ The New Jim Crow , ” it made me really wonder . Because I am already a conspiracy theorist .
 I don ’ t understand how you can be black and not be a conspiracy theorist . I wa doing a show on CNN , and a guy wa like , “ Why are you saying the system is similar to slavery ? ” It kind of caught me off guard , and I couldn ’ t really answer . But you ’ ve got people working for eight cent in here . You ’ re feeding people the [ expletive ] you would feed slave . You ’ ve got people cuffed up , shackled from top to bottom . People locked in the basement for 23 hour a day , being beat by the officer . It ’ s basically the same . And one of the amendment say that when you ’ re under custody of the government , you can be treated like a slave .
 Yes , the 13th . So you were first arrested — for the original charge — at 19 ? My first arrest wa actually going to school . In sixth or seventh grade . I wa suspended , and I didn ’ t want to tell my mom , so I tried to hang out in the hallway . I got caught and went to jail for trespassing . My mom had to come get me .
 What ’ s the charge you ’ re still on probation for ? Selling crack . This is to my dad ’ s soul : I wasn ’ t selling crack when they locked me up for it . When I got back , I had to get back in the street and start really selling weed to get me a lawyer , because everyone who had a public defender got crucified . My mug shot ha my face swollen , both side of my face beat up . I wa charged with fracturing the cop ’ s hand . You know how his hand got fractured ?
 Yeah , punching you . Yeah . He charged me for him punching my face . They said I pointed a gun at them . If somebody can sit there and tell you the story of how they didn ’ t point a gun at cop , nine time out of 10 , it ’ s true . It ’ s not too many people who can make it out of pointing a gun at a couple cop .
 I remember one time , this judge said , “ I don ’ t give people three to six month ; I give people three to six year ” — for something like a first-time weed charge . That always stuck with me . That ’ s not O.K . I mean , you can ’ t shoot nobody and expect to be getting chance . But if you were on probation and began smoking weed ? People in the ’ hood are going through real [ expletive ] . I barely sleep from so much trauma . Sometimes you just want to smoke and go to sleep .
 And you ’ ve got to think about it — you ’ ve got 18- , 19-year-old kid , sending them to a whole building full of rapist , killer . They put you in a cell with a 45-year-old man who got a life sentence , who ’ s a killer . This is your dad right here . He ’ s going to raise you . He ’ s going to show you how to clean the toilet , how to carry yourself . They ’ re not thinking about that . They ’ re just giving this guy three year to get taught this mentality .
 My mom wa a probation officer . She would tell me how certain officer would wait outside the person ’ s house , trying to catch them . And it ’ s for noncriminal thing , right ? The average person , I think , belief that people are being violated because they ’ re doing criminal activity . But I ’ ve had family and friend incarcerated , and part of their probation would be that they couldn ’ t drive . In a place with no public transit , they would drive to work and get violated . You can ’ t associate with known felon , but that mean you can ’ t be around your family member or go to the barbershop . You can ’ t associate with felon when you just came from prison , with a thousand felon in your face every day . That make no sense . One time the judge wa like , “ This is lenient , ” and in my head — I couldn ’ t say this — I wa like , Who are you to even say this is lenient ? If you gave me three month , that is not lenient . I ’ m going to lose my job , lose the lease on my house . She made it a condition that I couldn ’ t even rap .
 In prison , you were 23-and-1 , right ? Isolated all but one hour a day ? I can ’ t even imagine what that ’ s like . Nobody can . I wa just talking to 21 Savage in prison , and I wa like , This is the closest you ’ ve ever been to God in a room like this . The last time I wa on 23-and-1 , my lawyer came to see me , and I wa like , “ Did I go crazy and just don ’ t know I went crazy ? ” I started writing everything I wa feeling , but when I went back and looked at it , I wa spelling everything wrong , thing I know how to spell . I kept blacking out in the middle of the day — not passing out , but like falling asleep . I wa counting the bird on the wire : This bird ’ s gon na fly off in 10 , 9 , 8 , 7 . The bird don ’ t fly off , start over . Twenty-three and a half hour a day . Come out to take a shower , back to your cell . And I wasn ’ t in there for punishment — they had me on a mental block because I ’ m a celebrity , and they didn ’ t have anywhere to put me . Every time I got out , I ’ m like , yeah , I ’ m not the same no more .
 You ’ ve become the face of criminal-justice problem . When did you realize that you had a platform , and that you should use it to advocate for more than yourself ? When I saw the support people gave me . Everybody wa saying “ Free Meek , ” but it wa really like saying “ Free everybody who go through these conditions. ” It surprised me , because I ’ ve been in and out of prison for these type of thing for the past 11 year , and people were just like : “ Aw , he ’ s stupid . He keep going to jail. ” I am not stupid . It ’ s just normal mistake . I caught one case at the age of 19 . I am 31 . I have never been back to prison for a crime .
 You ’ re working with some powerful people in the Reform Alliance . Jay-Z , Michael Rubin , Robert Kraft , Clara Wu Tsai . Basically all billionaire except me . Robert Kraft saw me in prison , and he wa like , How are you still smiling ? He wa like , If that wa me , I would be depressed , mad , angry .
 You ’ re not ? You can ’ t sleep . Yeah , but that come from my environment . Coming from seeing violence , people robbed , people murdered , you heard gunshot every night — couldn ’ t sleep .
 So how do you deal with the trauma ? I just override it . I don ’ t know . Rapping is one of my therapy . I ’ ve never been a dweller to sit back and be sad about something . The saddest thing I can think about is Lil Snupe , an artist I had signed , got killed at 18 by a grown man . That bothered me a lot for two year , but I suppressed it and never really addressed it . Then one day , I started realizing that had damaged me , and I thought about it a lot .
 Do you actually think Reform Alliance can change the system ? I think it ’ s a possibility we can make a change . In Pennsylvania , they ’ re talking about changing the law of probation already , to where the cap is five year . That will be a big win for a lot of kid who will enter the system and probably would have gotten 10 to 20 .
 After everything , you ’ re still hopeful . Yeah . Hell , yeah . I got a mean team with me . I don ’ t think none of u lose in anything we do .

 How dozen of people own a slice of a hit .
 By JONAH WEINER
 How many people doe it take to write a No . 1 hit ? In the case of Travis Scott ’ s smash “ Sicko Mode , ” which came out Aug. 3 , 2018 , and ha been on Billboard ’ s Hot 100 chart every week since , 30 different songwriter are credited . That ’ s a preposterously high number that speaks , in part , to the shift in top-tier rap toward a collaboration-heavy , auteurist mode of creation . It also speaks to the song ’ s unorthodox structure . “ Sicko Mode , ” which Scott performed at the Super Bowl halftime show , switch between three different beat created by six different producer , with additional work , it turn out , from a Switzerland-based washing-machine salesman . In addition to three guest vocalist — one of whom is the Canadian superstar Drake , one of whom utters only three word and one of whom ha been dead for 13 year — it includes two vocal sampled from landmark rap song that are themselves dense with further sample from ’ 70s-era funk band and , for good measure , a handful of other landmark rap song . The DNA of “ Sicko Mode , ” that is , carry with it strand of ancient genetic material , and even if much of it is audible nowhere in the song itself , those strand show up in the credit . Here ’ s where each one lead .
 00:00 — 01:00
 1 . The woozy organ riff in the song ’ s first section wa created by the producer and classically trained pianist Rogét Chahayed , whose breakthrough track wa D.R.A.M. ’ s 2016 single “ Broccoli. ” The bass line and percussion come courtesy of Chauncey Hollis , better known a Hit-Boy , whose most famous co-production is Jay-Z and Kanye West ’ s “ Niggas in Paris . ”
 00:28 — 01:00
 2 . Aubrey Graham , a.k.a . Drake , is the first voice we hear , though his verse will be abruptly cut off . Chahayed ha explained that Drake and Travis Scott recorded a complete song over his and Hit-Boy ’ s beat , but in this Frankenstein version , we hear only about a minute of it .
 01:00 — 02:48
 3 . Travis Scott , born Jacques Webster , doesn ’ t appear on his own song until a minute in , when the music change entirely — one of the track ’ s many idiosyncrasy . Scott , asked if he could hear the song ’ s chart-topping potential before it release , say : “ Yeah , but other people weren ’ t hearing it . They ’ re looking at me like I ’ m crazy . I ’ m like , ‘ O.K . Just wait till it drop . ’ ”
 01:00 — 02:45
 4 . In 2015 , the Swiss producer Ozan Yildirim , a.k.a . Oz , wa given an email address that supposedly belonged to Travis Scott . He emailed beat for “ a year and a half , ” he say , with no reply . Finally , a response arrived : “ You have dope [ expletive ] . Keep sending. ” On Jan. 11 , 2018 , Oz sent what would become the second section of “ Sicko Mode . ”
 4A . Oz got help with a synthesizer sound from his friend Mirsad Dervic , a.k.a . M-Dee , an appliance salesman who make music on his day off .
 4B . Oz also used a sound from a pack of sample created by the German producing duo Tim and Kevin Gomringer , a.k.a . Cubeatz .
 01:15
 5 . Scott rap three word — “ Gim me the Loot ” — and a a result , 14 different people earn credit . Scott is quoting 1994 ’ s “ Gim me the Loot ” by the Notorious B.I.G . and includes a sample from it , so Biggie ( Christopher Wallace ) and the producer Easy Mo Bee ( Osten Harvey ) get credit . Things telescope from there …
 5A . “ Gim me the Loot ” sample a vocal from Gang Starr ’ s “ Just to Get a Rep , ” which mean that song ’ s author , Guru ( Keith Elam ) and DJ Premier ( Christopher Martin ) , are credited .
 5B . “ Gim me the Loot ” also sample Sticky Fingaz ’ s verse on Onyx ’ s rap classic “ Throw Ya Gunz , ” so even though Fingaz ( Kirk Jones ) play no part on “ Sicko Mode , ” he ’ s credited , along with his Onyx partner Chyskillz ( Chylow Parker ) , Sonny Seeza ( Tyrone Taylor ) and Fredro Starr ( Fred Scruggs ) .
 5C . “ Gim me the Loot ” sample another vocal , from A Tribe Called Quest ’ s “ Scenario ( Remix ) ” — a line from the late Troy Anthony Hall , a.k.a . Kid Hood . Strangely , Hall isn ’ t a credited writer on Biggie ’ s song or Scott ’ s , though Tribe ’ s Q-Tip ( Kamaal Fareed ) , Phife Dawg ( Malik Taylor ) and Ali Shaheed Jones-Muhammad are , along with the collaborator Busta Rhymes ( Trevor Smith ) , Bryan Higgins and James Jackson .
 01:36
 6 . Swae Lee , born Khalif Brown and half of the pop-rap duo Rae Sremmurd , turn a fragmentary sung phrase — “ Someone said ” — into one of “ Sicko Mode ” ’ s unlikeliest hook .
 01:40
 7 . In one of Scott ’ s many tribute to Houston screw music — a narcotic local subgenre named after the late DJ Screw — Scott includes two pitched-down a cappella bar from a Screw compatriot , John Edward Hawkins , a.k.a . Big Hawk , who wa killed in 2006 .
 02:17
 8 . Scott shout out the Miami rap icon Uncle Luke — born Luther Campbell , notorious for his work in 2 Live Crew — and drop in a sample from his 1992 song “ I Wan na Rock . ”
 8A . “ I Wan na Rock ” sample K.C . and the Sunshine Band ’ s “ That ’ s the Way ( I Like It ) , ” and so that group ’ s Harry Wayne Casey and Richard Finch get credit , despite appearing nowhere on “ Sicko Mode . ”
 02:48 — 02:56
 9 . The beat grind to a halt with a series of distorted kick drum before moving to it final section . This transition contains production from the Houston multi-instrumentalist Mike Dean , an executive producer on “ Astroworld . ”
 02:56 — 05:12
 10 . Tay Keith , born BryTavious Chambers , just graduated from college in Tennessee . He wa producing for local M.C.s when Drake got in touch via Instagram to discus collaborating . He ’ s responsible for the final section , including a drum pattern much like the one he built for Drake ’ s “ Nonstop . ”
 XXX
 11 . Scott ha known the Chicago rapper CyHi the Prynce , born Cydel Young , since Scott ’ s early day with Kanye West ’ s G.O.O.D . Music crew , of which Young is a member . Young helped Scott in crafting lyric .

 The real star of ‘ a star is born ’ is a song that few can agree on . is it any good ? yes . Yes it is .
 By WESLEY MORRIS
 Bradley Cooper ’ s “ A Star Is Born ” is a movie about an unknown singer named Ally , who ’ s afraid to perform her own song until a famous musician take one of her ballad , rearranges it , then drag her onstage to sing it with him for a stadium full of people who have no idea who she is . That song — “ Shallow ” — won an Oscar last month . It ’ s a soaring , Airbus of a ballad that ’ s satisfying to sing whether you ’ re Kelly Clarkson or pitchy old me .
 But “ Shallow ” isn ’ t the number that epitomizes the movie . That come past the halfway point , and your response to it sum up how far under Cooper ’ s spell you ’ ve fallen . I wa under pretty deep . Ally ’ s on the verge of superstardom , but nearly all of the singing we ’ ve seen her do ha been with Cooper ’ s character , Jackson Maine — this impossible fusion of grunge , root country , pill , booze , pain , encroaching deafness and the Whole Damn American Truth .
 We can sense that Jackson ’ s artistic attraction to Ally arises not just from her industrial-strength voice but from her way with an abstractly honest lyric and her knack for melody . She , too , seems “ authentic ” and virtuous ( she scribble down idea in a notebook ; she ’ s struggled and suffered to “ make it ” ) . His aversion to the artifice of showbiz would seem to be hers : It ’ s all about the craft for u , baby . The spell being cast is a matter of taste and prerogative , essentially that Ally is made from Jackson ’ s rib of purity .
 I , at least , assumed that Ally would turn into somebody like Brandi Carlile , a songwriter whose singing regularly reach the stratosphere but who we can tell is grounded and real because she hold a guitar the way , for some of u , a lawyer hold a degree from Yale — and because ... she ... isn ’ t ... a dancer . Ally , on the other hand , doe dance ( perhaps because it ’ s what her craft-neutral wisp of a manager want ) . And the first time we see America seeing her dance is after she ’ s introduced a the musical guest on “ Saturday Night Live. ” The song — “ Why Did You Do That ? ” — open with the plinky simulation of a steel drum or a music box , and then the question “ Why ? ” “ Why do you look so good in those jean ? ” she sings , a if she were all of Destiny ’ s Children . “ Why ’ d you come around me with an as like that ? ” Ally ’ s onstage with new , orange hair . ( Thanks , craft-neutral manager ! ) She ’ s wearing spangling athleisure and a pink hooded jacket made of a fabric I can describe only a “ gift bag. ” She ’ s with a male dancer who ’ s dressed complementarily in blue , and when she say , “ as like that , ” he grind himself into her .
 [ Read Rachel Syme ’ s profile of Lady Gaga . ]
 It ’ s here that I should say that I love this song . But according to the movie ’ s competing authenticity ( Jackson ’ s idea of it versus her manager ’ s ; rock versus pop ) , love is a luxury . Gaga wrote “ Why Did You Do That ? ” with , among other people , Diane Warren , a master of lugubrious balladry , a cheese whiz . But these woman are grilling that cheese . Gaga ’ s enthusiasm for repetition in a chorus slip an earworm on the hook . Why did you do that — do that , do that , do that , do that — to ME ? Next come a sugary helping of “ Hoooh-oooh-oooh , ” while a sloppy , synthy bass line slithers around it all . This song is sung with such umbrage and so much alarm that you don ’ t know whether to sing along or call Gloria Allred .
 But I watched Ally perform it with my hand to my mouth . I might have said aloud : “ Oh , Ally . Jackson ’ s going to hate this. ” And no sooner had I said it than the movie cut to Jackson watching with a face of stone . This song is confection and sex and feel-copping . It ’ s showbiz . Basically , it ’ s everything Jackson would seem to hate about whatever music is right now .
 When the movie cut to Jackson ’ s face , the Ike Turner of “ What ’ s Love Got to Do With It ” crossed my mind . And a few scene later , a version of Ike come over him while Ally is trying to have herself a “ Pretty Woman ” bath and Jackson enters . She ’ s sudsy . He ’ s soused . “ Why you come around me with an as like that , ” he say in disgust . “ Maybe I [ expletive ] failed you , ” he go on . “ You ’ re embarrassing , ” he slur . “ You ’ re just [ expletive ] ugly , ” he slur some more . Jackson doesn ’ t want to see “ Why Did You Do That ? ” a the hit of an ingénue , something anonymous-seeming that a new pop star try before a truer identity bubble up : Pink doing “ Most Girls , ” Katy Perry and “ I Kissed a Girl , ” Rihanna ’ s “ Pon De Replay , ” Gaga ’ s “ Just Dance , ” whatever the perma-ingénue Ariana Grande ’ s currently up to .
 Last fall , this one song , from this megahit movie , provoked perplexed essay and inspired The Times ’ s Kyle Buchanan to track down Warren and ask , Is it supposed to be bad ? Jackson think so . As much a I wanted to save this sexy , damaged , doomed man , on this , we disagree . “ Maybe it ’ s time to let the old way die , ” go his most mournful lyric . But maybe it ’ s also time to admit nothing ’ s wrong with an as like that .

 The origin and meaning of a meaningless viral hit .
 By JODY ROSEN
 The child ’ s song “ Baby Shark ” is a global smash , a hit that ha captivated million , conquering chart from Asia to Australia to the United States , where , this January , it reached No . 32 on the Billboard Hot 100 . It ’ s also a folk song , with origin a obscure a “ The Dowie Dens o ’ Yarrow ” or any of those other ancient air whose authorship long ago vanished in the mist . “ Baby Shark ” is thought to have been born in American summer camp , perhaps several decade ago . It is a staple of singalong , the sort of song that get belted out by group gathered at marshmallow roast and swimming pool . One theory hold that the song wa born in the summer of 1975 , when Steven Spielberg ’ s “ Jaws ” wa in theater and great white shark were gliding through the murky water of collective consciousness , to the strain of John Williams ’ s brooding score .
 The precise provenance of “ Baby Shark ” may never be pinned down . Its recent history is clearer . In November 2015 , Pinkfong , a South Korean educational brand , released a hopped-up rendition with an accompanying animated video . The following June , Pinkfong put out a second video , “ Baby Shark Dance , ” featuring two cute kid performing goofy dance move . It wa this clip that inspired the hashtag # BabySharkChallenge , instigating a viral craze that ha racked up more than two billion YouTube view and spawned unnumbered spinoffs starring everyone from Indonesian farmworkers to Filipino marine to Cardi B to , undoubtedly , your friend , your family , your baby trussed in a shark costume . In the United States , the # BabySharkChallenge ha received an extra viral boost , cross-pollinating with a dance craze linked to Drake ’ s anthem “ In My Feelings , ” in which people exit moving motor vehicle to dance and lip-sync a the car putter alongside .
 In other word , “ Baby Shark ” ha completed two full transmigration between folk and pop . It ’ s a folk song that became a pop song that filtered into social medium to become a folk song again — a grass-roots phenomenon that propelled the pop recording to improbable height of ubiquity . It exemplifies several feature of 21st-century culture : the porous boundary between the pop industrial complex and the amateur homespun ; a globalized circulation of song based a much on meme a on music ; the popularity of unchallenging dance “ challenge ” ; the hegemony of Drake .
 “ Baby Shark ” also exemplifies the timeless appeal of really stupid song . Musically , “ Baby Shark ” is efficient , with a foursquare beat driving an unvarying melody that return repeatedly to the wordless chorus “ Doo doo doo doo doo doo. ” This refrain repeat fully 27 time — a lot , in a song that run 1 minute 36 second . The first minute is devoted to introducing the dramatis persona : “ Baby Shark/Doo doo doo doo doo doo ... Mommy Shark/Doo doo doo doo doo doo , ” etc . The narrative , such a it is , is compressed into the song ’ s final third . The shark family go hunting , and it prey elude capture : “ Safe at last/Doo doo doo doo doo doo . ”
 Even the most rabid “ Baby Shark ” fan will concede that it is infantile . Which is not to say that it ’ s a child ’ s song . In fact , it ’ s an adult song masquerading a a kid ’ song . “ Baby Shark ” ha been sanitized : Traditional version sung by camper are mischievous and macabre , telling tale of shark attacking swimmer who lose limb and , usually , life . ( “ Call 911/Doo doo doo ... It ’ s too late/Doo doo doo. ” ) In one variation , a “ surfer dude ” is mauled , dy and is reincarnated a a baby shark : an artful cycle of gore , death , rebirth and more gore .
 “ Baby Shark , ” by contrast , seems engineered to please the parent . It ’ s a garishly wholesome affirmation of the nuclear family and end happily ; it dance can be mastered by the most rhythm-impaired . Is it a stretch to suggest that “ Baby Shark ” is music for grown-ups who are , a it were , in their feeling , stressed by the turmoil and dislocation of 21st-century life ? Compare “ Baby Shark ” with music popular with millennials : relentlessly dour rap and hip-hop-inflected pop , full of menace and foreboding , which face the bummer of 2019 head-on . “ Baby Shark ” offer an antidote , an escape : a song that delivers u from danger — safe at last ! — leaving nary a trace of blood in the water .

 Beyoncé And Jay-Z know whose work ha long been left out of the canon , and they won ’ t let it happen to theirs .
 By JENNA WORTHAM
 Last year , on one of the first stop of Beyoncé and Jay-Z ’ s “ On the Run II ” tour , the light of London Stadium dimmed , and the video for “ Apeshit ” began playing on enormous screen . The video open with the Carters dressed in gorgeous suit ( hers a Peter Pilotto in pink and red ; his , sea-foam green Dries Van Noten ) standing — alone — in front of the Mona Lisa at the Louvre . “ Have you ever seen a crowd going apeshit ? ” the song asks , and the answer lay in the reaction of the British concertgoers , who screamed , cried and danced .
 Whose history belongs in our museum ? The video and song meditate on this question . The history of black people ha too often been presented a little more than a curiosity . The 1889 world ’ s fair in Paris , for example , included a “ human zoo ” of indigenous people taken from French colony and placed in “ natural ” habitat for onlooker . During the 16th century , Africans were exhibited in the Vatican , and in 1906 a young Congolese man called Ota Benga wa forcibly kept at the Bronx Zoo . Even now , landmark museum like the Louvre tend to exhibit artwork that depicts Africans and their descendant a household servant and domestic worker . The Carters know this painful past , and in “ Apeshit ” they confront it .
 Lyrics like “ We livin ’ lavish , lavish/I got expensive fabrics/I got expensive habit ” could give the impression that the song is merely reveling in the luxury that extreme wealth can buy . One great complexity regarding the couple is their overt embrace of capitalism . Are they disrupting the status quo or reinforcing it ? But just beneath all that spending seethes an abject rage . “ I said no to the Super Bowl , you need me , I don ’ t need you , ” Jay-Z rap . “ Every night we in the end zone , tell the N.F.L . we in stadium too. ” The Carters are Colin Kaepernick-level fed up with institution that barely recognize them , whether it be the Grammys , which nominated Jay-Z eight time last year but gave him zero win , or Coachella , which featured Beyoncé a it first black female headliner only last year . “ Gim me my check , put some respect on my check . Or pay me in equity , pay me in equity ” is about money , yes , but it ’ s also a cry to be acknowledged for what they ’ ve earned . Their best revenge is their paper , but it ’ s also their own music-streaming service ( Tidal ) and a clothing line ( Ivy Park ) .
 [ Get to know the author of this article , Jenna Wortham , in a new Behind the Byline interview . ]
 The Carters have collaborated for almost two decade on song that rotate around their love of money ( “ ’ 03 Bonnie & Clyde ” ) and of infatuation ( “ Crazy in Love ” ) . But “ Apeshit ” represents a new era for their economic philosophy and value system . Wealth isn ’ t just for flashy living ; it ’ s about creating an empire for themselves and their offspring . Love is hard , unflattering work that sometimes requires setting aside ego and reputation . When Beyoncé sings of plan to get her girl and “ put ’ em all on a spaceship , ” you feel that it ’ s not lyrically convenient but that she really mean it . What would a world created entirely by and for black people look like ?
 Even a Beyoncé and Jay-Z have an estimated net worth of more than a billion dollar between them , they have managed to remain largely unscathed by a cultural tide that disdain the obscenity of late-stage capitalism . Perhaps that ’ s because they seem to be trying to undo a larger project of disinheritance . The video continues it tour of the Louvre , showing the Carters and dancer posing among some of the world ’ s most famous art . They are asserting that they belong . “ All of my people , I free ’ em all , ” Beyoncé sings . It ’ s a boast , but it ’ s also their mission .

 The same affected adolescent pain , updated for modern time .
 By JAIME LAUREN KEILES
 If you grew up listening to pop punk , a I did , then it ’ s easy to feel a though the mid-to-late aught were lost to a fold in adolescent space-time . Are we even sure that the genre ever happened ? Pop punk married punk power chord with the singable hook of a radio hit . The aesthetic wa embarrassing , even in it time — circus , graveyard , men in eyeliner . Want to fantasize about murdering your ex ? For a brief , fun lapse in those dubious year , such thought were best expressed in a high , clear whine , interspersed with bout of indiscriminate screaming . Today we might call pop punk “ problematic ” ( or maybe we ’ d call it musical theater ) . To me , at 14 , it wa more than visceral , a soundtrack for a time of hormonal disarray .
 Flash-forward nearly 15 year to the present , and somehow , improbably , pop punk is back in the form of the rap song “ Lucid Dreams ” by Juice WRLD . The track first appeared on the streaming platform SoundCloud and rose through the rank of the Billboard Hot 100 on the wing of brooding , sung-rapped pain : “ I still see your shadow in my room/can ’ t take back the love that I gave you/it ’ s to the point where I love and I hate you. ” “ Lucid Dreams ” is pop punk recapitulated — the same theme , the same whine , the same singable hook , with the power chord swapped out for insular drum and the plaintive guitar of Sting ’ s “ Shape of My Heart. ” It echo the pang of a Fall Out Boy track , throbbing with urgent teenage despair .
 Juice WRLD is 20 , from the suburb of Chicago . He describes his own music a “ a therapy session ” and cite influence like Fall Out Boy , Bullet for My Valentine , Senses Fail and Panic ! at the Disco . Like most rapper of this latest generation , these influence evolved in a post-streaming world , where album existed a free-floating track , somewhat detached from imposed genre label .
 Hit pop song that exploit algorithm are sometimes described a “ Spotifycore ” or “ streambait. ” If “ Lucid Dreams ” wa not produced to game the number , then at least this new system of musical incentive might help explain it unlikely rise . Rap music turn on it habit-forming beat , and pop punk thrives on earwormish hook . Accounting for the keen melodrama of both genre , it make perfect sense that a hybridized form would triumph in this new streaming ecosystem .
 Juice WRLD is not the first or only artist to work in the emo-rap subgenre . The rapper LiL Peep , who died from an overdose of fentanyl and Xanax in 2017 , wa extolled a “ the future of emo. ” The same might be said of XXXTentacion , a rapper who made violent , confessional music before he wa fatally shot last June . The trouble of this music scene have been well covered ; in brief , they reflect the real peril of our time — gun violence , a crisis of masculinity , dual drug and mental-health epidemic . If the pop-punk song of decade past were grandiose enough to be written off a camp , then the latest wave of emo-rap seems somehow right-sized for the terror of our moment . With this in mind , “ Lucid Dreams ” sound le catchy , or maybe it just sound le catchy to adult .

 Our freshest pop and country superstar is not the usual kind of outlaw .
 By LIZZY GOODMAN
 A couple of week before she would step onstage to accept the Grammy for Album of the Year , Kacey Musgraves wa under the cover in the bedroom at the back of her tour bus , pondering the nature of the universe . She had a little unexpected time on her hand . A show in Chicago had been canceled , thanks to the polar freeze that had descended over the Midwest , leaving her stuck in the middle of a vast tundra with a buildup of tour adrenaline and nowhere to put it . She watched some “ The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel , ” read a little “ The Catcher in the Rye ” and then lost herself down her favorite YouTube rabbit hole , a video genre in which someone mash up tweedy old-school physic lecture with wonky electro beat . “ It ’ s like if Daft Punk went totally science , ” she say , “ and I ’ m here for that . ”
 Later , she would stand in a diaphanous scarlet Valentino dress at the Grammys , giving a speech that could , given her tone and reputation , be read a subtly anti-authoritarian . “ Life is pretty tumultuous right now for all of u , ” she told the crowd . “ I feel like , because of that , art is really thriving. ” Musgraves is well known for her support of the L.G.B.T . community , her unabashed love of weed and her ability to turn a cutting phrase in her perfect Texas twang — particularly when she ’ s writing about the shackle of social convention . She started writing her winning album , “ Golden Hour , ” early in 2016 , when Donald Trump wa still assigning stinging nickname to his Republican primary opponent , and began recording it just after Trump ’ s inauguration . She ha tweeted in support of the Women ’ s March and in disdain of Eric Trump ’ s family-branded Christmas ornament . She speaks with pride about the stack of detention slip her mother still keep from her daughter ’ s time in the Mineola , Tex. , school system : “ I wa always getting in trouble for , like , insubordination. ” Add all that to the nose piercing that , a she famously sings on the rapturous single “ Slow Burn , ” made her grandmother cry , and you might expect her album to be a bit of a call to arm , a middle finger to a broken world .
 Not so much . “ I just got tripped out one day , ” she say , musing on her inspiration for the album . “ Thinking , Whoa , wait , we live in this world that seems so mundane , but at the same time that I ’ m sitting here , there ’ s thing that are glowing in the ocean and eating each other — and there ’ s also northern light and shooting star and plant that grow and literally heal people. ” She paused for breath . “ And it ’ s all happening around u , you know ? ” Falling for the man who is now her husband — the singer and songwriter Ruston Kelly — wa another part of the album ’ s genesis . “ It ’ s sort of a love song to him , ” she say , “ but also to nature , the human race , Earth and why we ’ re here . We don ’ t know , and I kind of love it . ”
 In other word , this wry firebrand ’ s big statement on the state of the world — at a time when so many of the issue she ha become famous writing about , like feminism and gay right , are making daily headline — is a metaphysical country-pop record more inspired by Carl Sagan than Willie Nelson . And just so we ’ re clear , Musgraves wa on acid only part of the time . “ It ’ s not like I wa tripping my face off every day , ” she clarifies . ( After she told reporter that psychedelics influenced a couple of song , including “ Slow Burn , ” it wa all anyone wanted to talk about . ) “ It ha only been a couple time . And very responsibly ! Enough to be able to get outside of yourself and see a different perspective or point of view . ”
 What make Musgraves such a resonant figure right now , in fact , is the way her response to a dark , anxious moment in human history is to move willfully closer to lightness , to stillness , toward the possibility of a world that come in more color than red or blue . When she talk about art thriving in this climate , she mean it — just not in the same sense a , say , angry punk railing against the Reagan administration . What she mean is that right now , the best rebellion involves turning off the hate and making space for hope . Or , a she put it : “ The [ expletive ] storm won ’ t last forever , and I want to make music that doe . ”
 [ Watch Kacey Musgraves turn country music psychadelic . ]
 I caught up with Musgraves in Wisconsin , on the tail end of January ’ s alarming deep freeze , which had temperature in the upper Midwest dropping a low a minus 40 . ( I missed her in Chicago , where everyone wa trapped inside , the street vacant apart from the odd extreme-weather junkie taking photograph of ice floe . ) Far from Valentino , she wa , for the moment , in sweaty Victoria ’ s Secret workout tights and a fluorescent-green beanie , sitting straddle-style on the floor of the bar at a Madison venue called the Sylvee , having just finished a workout via Skype with Erin Oprea , a trainer to many of Nashville ’ s star .
 “ O.K. , so this is the one I put on my story yesterday , ” she said , finding a clip she had posted to Instagram and showing me her phone . It wa something called Symphony of Science ’ s “ Quantum World , ” a favorite among those space-disco physic video . “ Featuring Neil DeGrasse Tyson , ” she chuckled , reading from the chyron at the bottom of a related clip . I had indeed seen her Instagramming this kind of mysterious , late-night Discovery Channel-type stuff — the sort of thing teenager once saw at the IMAX theater on a field trip after getting stoned . How did she get into it ? “ Oh , who know , it wa year ago , ” she replied , then sang happily along to a remix that showed Morgan Freeman superimposed on a colorful tunnel of celestial light . One of the scientist ’ 1970s professorial look , she pointed out , wa “ literally like what the band wear ” in her stage show .
 When Musgraves wa 18 and a contestant on the reality show “ Nashville Star ” — she placed seventh — she had to fill out a getting-to-know-the-contenders C.V . Under the category of “ dream vacation , ” she listed “ staying in a huge log cabin in the mountain , riding horse , hunting and four-wheeling with my friends. ” The “ craziest ” thing she ’ d ever done ? “ Hunting for Bigfoot deep in the wood of East Texas . ... We didn ’ t get him. ” That version of Musgraves — the one who cited Jack in the Box egg roll and beer a her favorite food — still appears at every show , even when she ’ s dressed like Bianca Jagger heading to Studio 54 . She ’ s the one leading the ritual preshow group shot of tequila , taken from tiny cactus-shaped glass she and her band have long been toting from show to show . And she ’ s the one hanging with me on the floor of a bar in Wisconsin , looking at video by a user with the handle “ melodysheep . ”
 And yet even in her early year , when Musgraves looked more the part of your average Nashville aspirant , in cowboy boot and blond highlight , there wa always a kind of poise , an innate regality that set her apart . This , perhaps , is the other side of her East Texas grit — the one that manifest le a yee-haw joy and more a D.I.Y . conviction . “ When it come to art , I will not bend , ” she say . “ I won ’ t . ”
 Musgraves grew up in Golden , Tex. , a town so small it doesn ’ t even have an elementary school . “ A few hundred people , ” she guess , is the total population . It ’ s about 90 minute from Dallas , and about six or seven mile outside Mineola , where Musgraves and her sister , Kelly Christine Sutton — a photographer , who shot the “ Golden Hour ” cover — went to school , and where their parent had a small printing shop . “ Even at a young age , ” Sutton say , “ I always knew my sister would be known for her music . And not really on anyone else ’ s timeline . She would make it happen on her own terms. ” It ’ s their parent ’ model of small-town independence , Musgraves figure , that gave her a tend-your-own-garden will . “ A large part of who I am come from the fact that I never saw my parent have boss , ” she say . “ They ’ ve never answered to anyone but themselves . And not in a baller way — like very small-business , check-to-check kind of a thing . But they made all their own decision . ”
 Growing up , she had a Spice Girls poster in her room — Ginger , with her wild tattoo , made a strong impression — and listened to emo rock band like the Used and Dashboard Confessional . But that wasn ’ t the sort of music she played . “ I wa part of this kid ’ group called the Buckaroos that would meet every month in the Fort Worth Stockyards and would dress up in cowboy clothing and stroll the stockyard and learn instrument , ” she recall . “ There were mentor there who kind of encourage kid to learn this old stuff. ” By 9 , she wa writing her own song and playing guitar ; by 12 , she wa singing Western swing and yodeling at festival on the weekend . Bookings and press kit were handled by her grandmother — the same one who later cried when Musgraves pierced her nose , and who referred to “ It Is What It Is , ” the singer ’ s melancholic ode to casual sex , a “ the slut song. ” “ She ’ s a hoot , ” Musgraves say . “ She wa wheeling and dealing . ”
 There wa , of course , the requisite period in which a teenage Musgraves turned her back on the whole cowgirl thing . “ I wa like , Dude , none of my friend think this is cool . If they saw me I ’ d be superembarrassed . I ’ m yodeling , you know what I mean ? ” She rebelled — for a second . “ I chopped off all my hair and wa like : Suck on that ! Now I can ’ t wear a cowboy hat , Mom ! ” ( “ You would not believe how upset my family wa , ” Sutton remembers . ) But this rebellion turned out to be short-lived . By the time Musgraves moved full time to Nashville , at 19 , she had realized “ nobody really in the country world wa embracing the hard-core root of the genre. ” But she had come to worship John Prine and Loretta Lynn — big-hearted , sharp-tongued , storytelling pillar of country ’ s outlaw root who had risen up in the ’ 70 by staging their own insurgency against the bubble-gumming-up of the genre . “ I randomly already had this superknowledge about all the old song that came before me , and that style , the Western fashion , ” Musgraves say . “ I wa like : I ’ m going to bring it back . I want to mix that in with something modern. ” Prine himself is now one of her many admirer ; he compare her to “ a goofy Cinderella. ” “ She ha a certain honesty to her voice , ” he say . “ She ’ s breaking down barrier . ”
 There ’ s a famous tale about Kacey Musgraves ’ s first big showcase performance for the Country Radio Seminar . This is a big-deal event in the business ; it attendee are queen-makers in an industry in which success is still determined by access to radio airwave . The story of her 2013 debut there smack of a plotline on “ Nashville ” — appropriate , given that she co-wrote “ Undermine , ” one of the hit to emerge from the juggernaut TV series . You can easily picture the kind of episode Musgraves ’ s performance might have inspired . A young woman take the stage at the legendary Ryman Auditorium , the so-called Mother Church of country , about to play the song that could make or break her career . We learn that she ’ s being hyped — thanks to her preternatural songwriting skill , good look and the already-feverish crossover response to her first single , “ Merry Go Round ” — a the Veronica to Taylor Swift ’ s Betty : a sassier but potentially just a marketable product . As is the industry ’ s way , the corporate power would like this rising phenom to be herself , but only within reason . They ’ d prefer she refrain from playing what will become her third single — the one with the line about smoking joint and kissing girl — until after she can already be heard in every Walgreens in America . But the woman step up to the microphone , lean into it a little and speaks : “ I ’ m kind of a big believer in people doing whatever the hell they want to do , because I feel like society is probably going to have an opinion either way. ” Then she start strumming “ Follow Your Arrow. ” As she delivers it opening line — “ If you save yourself for marriage , you ’ re a bore/If you don ’ t save yourself for marriage you ’ re a horr- ” — the crowd gasp . Then she finish — “ -ible person ” — and the audience laugh . A star is born .
 It ’ s easy to wonder where Musgraves got the nerve . It ’ s one thing to admire your parent ’ entrepreneurial spirit , and another to hold your own amid the chaos and pressure of the starmaking machine . For Musgraves , performing alongside Dolly Parton at the Grammys , winning Album of the Year , presenting an award at the Oscars — all of this is unequivocally her dream . But it ’ s also something she belief she could live without , and remembering this ha become a kind of daily meditation , especially a the scope of her fame ha increased . “ I don ’ t get high off my own supply , you know ? ” she say , mentioning , by way of inspiration , Willie Nelson ’ s ability to welcome “ Republicans , rapper , president , my grandpa , your grandpa , our hipster friend , me ” without treating anyone a superior to anyone else . “ You can be proud of yourself and excited for what you ’ re doing , and you could even really have a high level of confidence , without being a D-bag . ”
 In Musgraves ’ s mind , she made it the minute she signed her first songwriting deal , back in 2009 , penning tune that would be sold around Nashville to other performer . That wa the day she realized she would never again have to work a job in which she dressed up a Disney character for child ’ s birthday party , one of many day gig she had endured . “ For the next few year , ” she say , “ I wa like : Really ? Wait , I can use my brain , sit on my as and make a living ? ” When her current label first made her an offer to record a an artist , Musgraves turned it down ; she wa having a perfectly good time a a writer . She also knew she didn ’ t have real access to her own voice yet . “ Those song were fine for other artist , ” she say . “ Maybe they could be popular on the radio or something , but they ’ re not very me . ”
 By the time Musgraves eventually located her particular voice , it wa already honed to a sharp edge . Her first hit , “ Merry Go Round , ” from 2012 , is packed with the kind of mordant wordplay she ’ d be known for , conjuring a “ same trailer , different park ” world where people marry out of boredom and settle “ just like dust ” into small-town life : “ Mama ’ s hooked on Mary Kay , brother ’ s hooked on Mary Jane , Daddy ’ s hooked on Mary two door down. ” But after two album and multiple world tour , Musgraves felt worn out by her own verbal cleverness . “ Everyone hopefully know I can flip a phrase by now , and I like that , ” she say . “ But I don ’ t want bumper-sticker songs. ” It also concerned Musgraves that the refreshing directness with which she had addressed social issue might start to feel heavy-handed , even ideologically gimmicky . She is , a she put it diplomatically , “ noticing thing about the world that I ’ m not happy with. ” But when she started working on “ Golden Hour , ” it no longer felt right to address them directly . “ Everyone that ’ s listened to any of my music know exactly how I feel , ” she say . “ This record doe kind of nod to some of the social and political thing that are going on , but it ’ s just doing it in a different way . It ’ s not a linear . ”
 Back on her bus , in Wisconsin , after playing to a couple thousand freezing fan who arrived lit and ready to party , Musgraves decompressed again . Gone wa the collection of product the singer us to transform herself from the kind of girl her sister remembers Musgraves sometimes presented a in high school — “ Converse , Dickies and black eyeliner ” — to the flamboyantly feminine star who share the stage with “ RuPaul ’ s Drag Race ” contestant . ( “ I have thought , Am I just doing this because it ’ s expected , or do I actually enjoy it ? ” Musgraves said to me earlier , while spraying her face with a mist of foundation . “ And it ’ s like : No ! I enjoy it ! ” ) Now she wa in slipper and a kind of housecoat , which I mentioned made her look approximately like my grandmother . “ Let ’ s just say I also have a towel warmer , ” she replied . She puttered around her kitchen , making mug of ginger tea . Then she pointed out where the bus ’ s temperature control were , and the cabinet where she keep the melatonin gummies , and said good night .
 Tucked away with her tasteful crystal collection in the earth-toned bedroom in the back of the bus — the first she ha ever had , after touring for year alongside “ 15 other people ” — there were any number of thing might have turned her attention to . She could have looked at spec for the adult coloring book she ’ s designing with her mother , or maybe FaceTimed with her husband , Ruston Kelly , also on tour somewhere in the frozen Midwest . She might have scrolled through the look her stylist had just sent through for the Grammys ; she wa still searching for something just right to match Dolly Parton . Or there wa Musgrave ’ s common insomnia treatment , shopping on eBay : “ I get down a little rabbit hole , ” she told me , “ ordering old toy that they don ’ t make anymore . Like doll from the ’ 80 or ’ 90 . If I ever have a girl , it could be cute to give her P.J . Sparkles , or Makeup Beauty , or whatever , you know ? ” They would all be shipped to Nashville , where they ’ d be waiting for her when she got home — whenever that wa .
 “ I mean , my 2020 is planned out , ” she told me earlier . “ I ’ m going to be putting another record out . I haven ’ t made that yet , so I need to write that and make that . Lots to do. ” It is imposing , you ’ d guess , to have an album scheduled for release that you haven ’ t begun to record . “ It ’ s scary , ” she allowed . “ You worry that the muse is not going to visit you again. ” She reached for her lip gloss . “ There ’ s no banking on it . So it ’ s odd that there ’ s an entire industry banking on it. ” She ’ s not worried , though . Her latest idea showed up a few week ago — a low-key , “ kind of like Bill Withers meet Sade ” track she ’ s calling , for the moment , “ Good Wife. ” She like it ease , she say : “ It ’ s not trying too hard . ”

 Post Malone , Spider-Man and the unexpected power of adolescent awkwardness .
 By SAM ANDERSON
 Like most ancient people in their declining year , I keep up with today ’ s hit music entirely through my teenage daughter . She carry her Bluetooth speaker from room to room with the tender devotion of a mother cat ferrying kitten across a flooded stream . Thanks to her , we scramble egg and make toast and fold laundry in an ambient cloud of Chance the Rapper , Drake , Nicki Minaj , Nicki Minaj featuring Drake , Drake featuring Nicki Minaj , Lorde , Rihanna , “ country ” Taylor Swift and “ dubstep ” Taylor Swift .
 Over the last year , an increasingly dominant voice in this mix ha been Post Malone , a 23-year-old sort-of-rapper from suburban Dallas . “ Posty , ” a my daughter and other fan call him , first went viral on SoundCloud in 2015 . By 2018 , he trailed only the omnipotent Drake on Spotify ’ s list of most-streamed artist . For a long time I had trouble distinguishing Post Malone ’ s superhits from everyone else ’ s . Like most other post-Drake star , he is an amphibious rap-singer who like to brag about his vast wealth and sexual conquest — except when he is spending long soulful interlude lamenting exactly those thing .
 But Post Malone , my daughter helped me understand , is popular a much for his persona a for his music . He is a superhero of silly , sloppy , irresponsible ease — a hard-living , cheerful goofball whose happiness make everyone else happy . He seems to smile with extra teeth . Post Malone is slightly chubby and unkempt , with scuzzy facial hair and infinite tattoo , including two under his eye that say , in fancy script , “ Always Tired. ” ( He meant to choose two word of equal length , he ha said , but got it wrong because — of course — he wa tired . ) Everything he doe seems half-accidental . He first learned to play guitar because he wa extremely good at the video game Guitar Hero . He chose his stage name using an online rap-name generator . ( His real name is Austin Post . ) He once tweeted a photo of himself in Australia petting a kangaroo , with the caption “ Met a koala today . ”
 This sort of giddy misidentification is , in fact , the key to Post Malone . He is not exactly a rapper but is also not not a rapper . His musical root reach down to country , metal , folk and rock — online , you can watch him play loving cover of Bob Dylan and Nirvana . What finally distinguishes Posty from the mainstream crowd is his voice , which ha a touch of rock ’ n ’ roll grit that wrestle through the Auto-Tune . And yet his megasuccess ha mainly come under the umbrella of hip-hop . He performed his first hit single , “ White Iverson , ” in gold teeth and cornrows , raising inevitable question of cultural appropriation . He say he prefers to think of himself a beyond genre , which is convenient , because he ha sometimes been head-slappingly inarticulate on the subject . “ If you ’ re looking for lyric , if you ’ re looking to cry , if you ’ re looking to think about life , don ’ t listen to hip-hop , ” he once said , to near-universal disapproval .
 Post Malone , in other word , is a big roiling mess of contradiction . No wonder he is so popular with teenager . He is the perfect avatar of adolescence : the excruciating ridiculousness of being a person caught between world , in transition , half-young and half-old , in possession of power you don ’ t fully understand , blasting off into inscrutable realm in which mysterious thing will be expected of you . This also make Post Malone a perfect fit for Spider-Man , the canonical story of awkward adolescent empowerment . Posty ’ s latest No . 1 hit , “ Sunflower , ” is not merely featured on the soundtrack of the franchise ’ s newest iteration , “ Spider-Man : Into the Spider-Verse ” : It is actually used , in the film , to introduce the hero . We meet the teenage Miles Morales in his bedroom , alone , doodling and bobbing his head to the bouncy hit about a dysfunctional relationship . ( “ Callin ’ it quits now , baby , I ’ m a wreck , ” his collaborator Swae Lee sings . “ Crash at my place , baby , you ’ re a wreck. ” ) Miles sings along , straying off key , only to be interrupted by his father , who yell at him to get ready for school . The awkward teenager is called , awkwardly , out into the world . Amid all the cringiness , his unexpected superpower will bloom . Adolescence , despite it obvious flaw , can still save the world .

 A 15-Track Fun house album that add up to a single song .
 By JOHN WRAY
 “ Whack World , ” Tierra Whack ’ s debut collection of 15 track — each clock in at 60 second — wa one of the riskiest gamble of the past year in pop : It would have been written off a a gimmick if it weren ’ t so goofily , trippily , intoxicatingly good .
 The 15-minute album , which dropped in May with an accompanying “ Visual and Auditory Project ” on various video platform , offer a guided tour of one precociously gifted 23-year-old American ’ s worldview . It is both a brazen bid for the big time and a disquietingly intimate glimpse inside a wildly idiosyncratic mind — in tantalizing , and occasionally maddening , chunk of tightly rationed time . The experience is a bit like being invited up to the treehouse of the artsy , slightly spooky girl next door , to discover that it ’ s vastly larger and more colorful on the inside — only to be booted out again before you ’ ve done much more than glimpse the décor .
 Recent year may have seen the rise of what Pitchfork dubbed the “ super-short rap song , ” with ( mostly male ) act like Lil Pump and Trippie Redd releasing track a short a 1 minute 32 second ; but “ Whack World ” is a different beast entirely . Each track end after no more than one minute : some segue seamlessly into the next musical idea , some cut off in what feel like midverse . ( A minute , not coincidentally , wa the maximum length supported by Instagram when “ Whack World ” had it candy-cane-colored debut . ) Repetition is the lifeblood of any pop song , but most of the album ’ s lyrical fragment barely last long enough to revisit the first hook , let alone the chorus — if there is one — before we ’ re off to the next room in the fun house .
 The difference between “ Whack World ” and an aggressively repetitive earworm like Lil Pump ’ s hit , “ Gucci Gang , ” can be summed up very simply : Tierra Whack abhors boredom , and her first line of defense is , for want of a better word , wackiness . Where Pump mumble vaguely about forgetting girl ’ name while walking down a high school hallway with a tiger , holding football-size bag of weed , Whack ride a rickety exercise bike , in a fat suit , singing in a helium-tweaked voice about lowering her cholesterol . She ha the weird kid ’ s ability ( and willingness ) to laugh at herself , a quality that her self-professed role model Missy Elliott and Andre 3000 have always possessed but that is sorely lacking in a great deal of contemporary hip-hop — and pop music in general . It say more than a little about Whack ’ s sensibility , not to mention her take on relationship , that the album ’ s one and only love song is about a dead dog .
 “ Whack World ” the video , with it Mister-Rogers ’ -Neighborhood-with-LSD-in-the-water-supply visuals , invokes Elliott ’ s spirit in another sense too . Tierra Whack is beautiful , in a normal , human way , but unlike many of her contemporary — Ariana Grande , Chris Brown , Ava Max , Drake — she ’ s far too intoxicated by her own hypercreativity to trade on her look . In the video ’ s second vignette , which accompanies the playfully morose “ Bugs Life , ” Whack sits in a nail salon with the right half of her face grotesquely swollen from an insect bite , singing in a voice dripping with deadpan irony : “ Probably would ’ ve blowed up overnight ... if I wa white. ” Sex may sell out where the rest of u live , but it ha marvelously little currency in Whack ’ s treehouse . Whack — a opposed to , say , Frank Ocean — is by no mean a piner . Past romance is referenced from time to time , but largely in passing , a if the interesting stuff lay elsewhere . In fact , the album ’ s speed and brevity feel driven by nothing so much a precocious impatience : You can ’ t escape the impression that it creator would gladly have contributed another six , or a dozen , or even 100 additional track — however many it took to roll up literally everything she ’ d ever experienced into a single beautiful , lopsided , sequin-spangled ball .
 “ Whack World ” subverts accepted notion of “ album ” and “ single ” in equal measure . In spite of it undeniable of-the-moment-ness , this is not a collection of music best served by Spotify ( or any other randomized and algorithm-driven playlist ) . Almost no one , I ’ m willing to bet , would be satisfied playing only one of the album ’ s 15 track . Whack ’ s debut come closest to a distinctly old-fashioned ( and distinctly uncool ) staple of popular music : the medley . In a quarter-hour , she take u on an attention-deficit-disorder safari through seemingly every genre and subgenre that ha ever turned her head , from R & B to trap to doo-wop to reggaeton to — well , to something that can best be described a psychedelic anti-country a sung by Weird Al ’ s manic-depressive little sister . By the time you ’ ve finally begun to acclimate to the sheer magpie-inventiveness of “ Whack World , ” the magical mystery tour is over . And what a short , strange trip it wa .

 Cutting through the ( bong ) smoke to address the whens of climate change .
 By LARRY FITZMAURICE
 Music ha mourned the death of our planet for decade . “ How much more abuse from man can she stand ? ” Marvin Gaye asked in 1971 on “ Mercy Mercy Me ( The Ecology ) . ” The college-rock astronaut Black Francis sang of hole in the sky and rising temperature on the Pixies ’ “ Monkey Gone to Heaven ” in 1989 , grimly concluding that “ Everything is gon na burn. ” Four year later , the dance duo Orbital used warning klaxon on “ Impact ( The Earth Is Burning ) ” to conjure urgency about our impending global doom . Melissa Etheridge asked “ Have I been careless ? ” on a song called “ I Need to Wake Up , ” from the soundtrack to “ An Inconvenient Truth. ” Others , perhaps , are resigned to watching the world burn : “ I wan na see the animal die in the tree , ” Anohni proclaimed in 2016 on her acerbic indictment “ 4 Degrees . ”
 If you ’ ve lost sleep over gigantic hole in Antarctic glacier or the drastic decline of insect population , the last several year have felt like the final third of Lars von Trier ’ s “ Melancholia , ” in which humanity awaits Earth ’ s catastrophic collision with another planet : watching our fate snap back like a boomerang , coming at u faster than ever with little in the way of prevention or defense . Until recently , there have been so many perceived wrong to address on any given day that climate change ha frequently found itself low on the list of to-do ’ s in our general consciousness ; now , not even Demi Lovato and Joe Jonas — whose 2010 climate-change anthem , “ Make a Wave , ” claimed that “ We hold the key that turn the tide ” — can save u .
 Which brings u to the Brooklyn indie rocker Parquet Courts : “ Which hand get to turn the final page ? ” Andrew Savage dryly intones on “ Before the Water Gets Too High , ” a dread-drenched meditation that skip the ifs of climate change and head straight to the whens . How do we prepare for devastation , and can we reckon with how useless our effort to stop it have been ?
 Such question have largely gone unasked in the indie sphere , especially a the genre signifier ha transitioned over the last decade from ethos to marketing term . They ’ re new to the oeuvre of Parquet Courts a well ; before the political party-punk of last year ’ s “ Wide Awake ! ” the band spent more time musing about stoned bodega trip and the literal gathering of dust . But “ Wide Awake ! ” found them addressing sociopolitical concern including gentrification and groupthink , structural violence and the aftereffect of apathy , all with the freaked-out clarity of a wasted reveler realizing that the globe ’ s last keg is about to be kicked .
 The dubby fragrance of “ Before the Water Gets Too High ” suggests that their bong-session day aren ’ t behind them yet , but it also situates the song within dub reggae ’ s history of cutting through the smoke to address the fear involved in confronting societal calamity . “ Glass barely bend before it crack , ” Savage lilt on the song ’ s bridge , underlining the starkest truth of our certain demise : It ’ s coming , and we ’ re all out of warning sign .

 Music not made for this world .
 By ALEXANDRA KLEEMAN
 “ Cerebral pop ” is an uneasy category , like going on a “ working vacation ” or dressing “ business casual. ” The term betrays a certain amount of internal struggle : What exactly is this music asking you to do with your body ? Sigh , stare up at the ceiling fan and ponder the song a if it were a text ? Or do what you do when some other tune catch you — flail your limb , move your hip in weird little circle , bob your head rhythmically up and down ? The world wa built for pop song : Public space pump the voice of star through speaker the way air flow through ventilation duct , and that sweet , consistent flavor — like Diet Coke or pamplemousse LaCroix — pair easily enough with any modern pastime . But if the territory of pop music is everywhere , how and where doe a piece of art pop — something equal part challenging and engaging — make it home ?
 Julia Holter , a Los Angeles-based artist with a background in composition , answer this question by creating otherworldly space in her own work . On her album , medieval harmony and insectlike synths enjamb ; there ’ s a sense that what you ’ re hearing is very ancient and very modern at the same time , or even that those word no longer matter at all . This is the sort of world-building on display in Holter ’ s sixth studio L.P. , “ Aviary , ” which take it title from a line by the Lebanese-American writer Etel Adnan : “ I found myself in an aviary full of shrieking bird . ”
 From it opening — a cacophony of cymbal and anxiously pacing string — the album is a study in creating a private dwelling place amid the chaos and uncertainty of the world . On one track it ’ s a place of emergency , with crisscrossing bagpipe and voice evoking a landscape pierced by unending siren ; on another it ’ s a dream , with a wintry , synth-heavy gloom giving way to hazy tenderness , like a Kate Bush song peered at through depth-obliterating fog . The world glimpsed here are varied , sometimes wildly so , but what they share is the sense that they are not so much depicting reality a taking inspiration from it , channeling familiar feature into new form .
 Out of this thicket of sound and confusion come “ I Shall Love 2 , ” a five-minute track that feel like stepping out of a dark forest that you ’ ve been wandering in a daze , into a clearing where you can feel the full strength of the sun . You may still be lost , but now there ’ s a real sense of liberation to it . Holter begin with a bare-voiced reading of a fragment from an old troubadour song — “ That is all , that is all/there is nothing else ” — followed by soft organ and a cantering , loping beat . There ’ s a lull that last far longer than you ’ d expect before Holter begin to murmur , low and private , a if musing to herself . The lyric are a patchwork — line borrowed from troubadour song and Dante ’ s “ Inferno , ” Holter ’ s own word — all unified by her agile delivery , which glide from that soothing murmur to a yelp to a torch song . One by one , new pattern and phrase are thrust into the space of the song , lingering and dissipating and overlapping , until they ’ ve become a joyous squall , a raucous flock of melody that ’ s ecstatic and ethereal and raw all at once .
 Holter , in other word , take the garden path to catharsis , allowing something uplifting to emerge from the tumult , making chaos resolve itself into something humane and beautiful and full of intention . And she ha found , even at music festival and rock club , hushed and attentive audience for this . ( Much like her contemporary Julianna Barwick or the Norwegian musician Jenny Hval , Holter ’ s music occupies that narrow margin of overlap between the stuff you listen to for pure enjoyment and the stuff you listen to for mental nourishment . ) Her performance are absorbing : They highlight the organic beauty and authority of her voice , the way the meaning of word can be a sort of veneer over their untamed musicality . The music reward more than just hearing it . It reward some other kind of listening , asking you to let yourself become porous .
 And lately it can fill an appetite that seems both modern and primal at once : to make whole a fractured attention span , to find a ritual that work . Our day are full of tiny sliver of time that we offhandedly cram with music , filling the gap between task and place like someone idly coloring in a picture . It ’ s satisfying to engage with sound that won ’ t fit easily into those pre-existing slot , that dwell strangely in the everyday , transforming it , opening it up , urging you to conjure the imaginary , not-yet-existent space in which they might fit . Holter ’ s music is the opposite of filler : It ’ s a trap door leading to someplace that ’ s not your own .

 The pop star cedes the stage .
 By CHARLES AARON
 Maroon 5 ’ s success contains multitude . There may be no better example of this than the group ’ s pop-soul exhalation “ Girls Like You , ” which spent seven week last year atop Billboard ’ s Hot 100 and 33 week in the Top 10 . Though the song began a a demo by the L.G.B.T . artist Starrah , about her own feeling for a female friend , it wa then punched up and polished by a trio of gnomic writer and producer — Henry ( Cirkut ) Walter , Jason Evigan and Gian Stone — before the heavily compressed and reverbed track wa spiced up with the most distinctive voice of the past year , that of Cardi B .
 These figure are not the one who most make “ Girls Like You ” matter , though . Neither doe Adam Levine ( who get a writing credit ) or his happy-to-be-here sidemen who constitute the Maroon 5 touring entity . Nor do the boisterous Voice of Atlanta gospel choir and Equinox Percussion drum corp who enlivened the band ’ s performance of the song during this year ’ s Super Bowl halftime show .
 These contributor all gave shape and solidity to Maroon 5 ’ s vaporous cultural presence . But at a time when woman and nonwhite men have been facing down the White House and law enforcement ’ s relentless disrespect with civic , public and artistic resolve , the most crucial multitude were the 26 female entertainer , athlete , politician , activist and survivor who seized control of the song ’ s video , which wa the most-watched clip of 2018 , with 1.6 billion view .
 As the camera circle , Levine stand in the center of a soundstage , arm by his side , his voice skipping nimbly over the melody . He ’ s the ultimate embodiment of a stubbly , privileged white bro who belatedly realizes that he need his partner . Coming from Levine , the song ’ s colloquial lyric seems to distill toxic masculinity and the exploitation of woman ’ s emotional labor : “ Maybe it ’ s 6:45/Maybe I ’ m barely alive/Maybe you ’ ve taken my shit for the last time , yeah/Maybe I know that I ’ m drunk/Maybe I know you ’ re the one/Maybe you ’ re thinking it ’ s better if you drive . ”
 As the verse-chorus unfolds , Levine is joined one at a time , their back to his back , by the 26 woman . Dancing and exuding playful charisma , some acknowledge him ; some don ’ t . Then , le than two minute in , he suddenly disappears , a if ceding the spotlight . When Cardi B delivers her final flourish , he return briefly , but by the end of the video , the soundstage is occupied by only the woman .
 Adam Levine is to a rock star a a 2019 rock star is to a 2019 rapper . In other word , he ain ’ t it . Rather , he ’ s the genial tattooed tycoon who craves cooler and edgier friend but just can ’ t seem to make it happen . At 39 , he ’ s the shredded-abs dad bod that everybody ha seen one too many time . But in the “ Girls Like You ” video , Levine owns all that . At least in this moment , he leaf the pocket T-shirt on , keep the guitar in the closet and hand the mic to the long-suffering woman who have chosen to support him . For the first time , maybe ever , he flash some legit star-power potency .

 The new face of gangsta rap broadcast his crime and wind up in handcuff .
 By WILLY STALEY
 The first time I saw the video for Tekashi 6ix9ine ’ s “ Gummo , ” I felt a little bit like Rip Van Winkle wandering down from the Catskills . What in the world happened here ? I wa only gone for an hour ! Some element were familiar ( a crew of guy in front of a brownstone , drinking and mugging for the camera ) , and some were menacing ( the number of red bandanna and gun on display ) , but it wa the man at the center of the video who startled me most ; he seemed almost precision-engineered to make people feel old .
 He wa screaming himself hoarse about robbing and shooting people , over a haunting , spare beat , but I ’ d heard that before — it wa his appearance that shocked me . In an era when most young rapper have a couple of face tattoo , 6ix9ine had the number 69 inked above his right eye in 72-point type . He had the same number spelled out in cursive over his left eye . It wa everywhere on his body . His scraggly hair wa dyed ROYGBIV , and he had a grill to match . He looked like one of those frog you ’ re not supposed to touch .
 Within about a year , he would be in federal custody , a 22-year-old facing life in prison for a number of charge , including racketeering and attempted murder . Law enforcement accused 6ix9ine and others in his circle of being member of the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods and , under the RICO Act , charged them with participating in shooting and robbery all over New York City . Normally this sort of arrest lead to an outcry about literal-minded police overreach . Not this time . People generally seemed pleased to see the rapper in cuff .
 This wa partly because 6ix9ine wa universally reviled by music critic and journalist , on account of a crime he committed before he became famous : In 2015 , he pleaded guilty to the use of a minor in a sexual performance , for having filmed and shared on social medium a video of a girl performing oral sex on his friend . But it wa also because he had spent the past year living the life of a Looney Tunes character : courting danger , narrowly escaping it , then taunting his foe . This genuinely incredible run netted him more than 150 story on TMZ : gang member in San Antonio threatening his life ; a shootout at the Barclays Center ; shot fired at a video shoot in Brooklyn ; more shot fired at a Beverly Hills video set . Through it all , he posted on Instagram , usually wearing red , often handling brick of cash , sometimes clutching extremely illegal-looking gun , but never betraying an ounce of concern for his well-being .
 [ More on the rapid rise and sudden fall of Tekashi 6ix9ine . ]
 Cultivating this sort of personal mythology is not at all new ; it date back to the earliest day of gangsta rap . Ever since Eazy-E bankrolled NWA with drug money , a certain proximity to criminality ha been expected of certain rapper . If your music purport to document life on the other side of the law , then you better know what you ’ re talking about . Not long ago , rapper had just a few limited channel through which to prove that they did : lyric , album art and , if they were famous enough , music video . Like Old Testament god , they willed whole universe into being through their word .
 Now they have social medium . Case in point : On “ Stoopid , ” which came out last fall , 6ix9ine insult two rapper he wa feuding with at the time , but unless you were listening for it , you probably wouldn ’ t have noticed . Much more memorable were the Instagram video he made to antagonize the two ; in one he took his rival ’ s former girlfriend and mother of his child out shopping .
 This sort of online mythmaking is second nature to SoundCloud rapper , so called for the streaming service that birthed the scene . SoundCloud rap is not characterized by a particular sound so much a it anarchic energy — the face tattoo , the prescription drug , the orthographically complex handle . This scene ha been alarmingly fecund and seems to accelerate evolution in disturbing direction , a little like Lake Springfield on “ The Simpsons. ” Even within this ecosystem , 6ix9ine stood out like a chumbox thumbnail — is he ... real ?
 The problem , for 6ix9ine , wa that a big part of his adopted persona , both on Instagram and in his music , involved being a member of the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods . According to a Rolling Stone profile that came out after his arrest in November , this wa essentially an act : Danny Hernandez , in the year leading up to his fame , had been a trollish and goofy Bushwick deli employee ; his industry blacklisting had pushed him into the hand of an apparently gang-affiliated manager , who also provided him with a new edge . 6ix9ine is far from the only rapper to have ever made dubious claim to being a Blood , but Instagram ha a way of making even the most absurd feint real . Maybe the whole thing really wa a put-on , but also , he really did it . The Rolling Stone article recount how , at his arraignment , the presiding judge asked the prosecution how it knew Hernandez wa at real-life crime scene . “ The answer wa often simple : Hernandez had posted about it on Instagram . ”
 A liminal space ha always existed between rapper and their persona . Sometimes it ’ s a thin a a fig leaf , but even then it ’ s essential , both legally and morally . The gap between 6ix9ine and Danny Hernandez wa considerably wider , but he snapped it shut with his phone , merging fantasy with reality through a front-facing camera . Once intertwined on a criminal indictment , the two aren ’ t easily unwound . It wa reported in February that 6ix9ine , who pleaded guilty , agreed to help prosecutor in their case against his co-defendant , hoping for leniency : a reduced sentence and possibly witness protection . But helping 6ix9ine disappear into some corner of America might prove difficult , and not just because of the tattoo .

 Talking to the pop star about approaching life a if you ’ re seducing it .
 Interview by LAURA SNAPES
 In 1993 , the Swedish singer-songwriter Robyn turned 14 and finished middle school ; then she signed a record deal . She ha been making music ever since , starting with her 1995 debut album , “ Robyn Is Here , ” which netted her two Billboard Hot 100 single . Her 2005 album , “ Robyn , ” cemented her a a beloved , idiosyncratic pop star and earned her a Grammy nomination . She released a trilogy of mini-albums in 2010 , which included some of her biggest hit — “ Dancing on My Own ” and “ Call Your Girlfriend. ” Now , after a long gestation period , she ha returned with a new album and single , “ Honey . ”
 You ’ ve described the making of this song a searching for a feeling . A feeling of healing from sadness and wanting to share that with the world and with myself — a sense of self-love , excitement , some kind of peace of mind . Like when your strength is coming back . I wanted to describe this feeling like when you ’ re super close to someone else ’ s skin , or when you ’ re falling asleep , or when you ’ ve taken a drug that ’ s starting to kick in — sensation that are pleasurable , where your body is reacting to something outside of you .
 I felt naïve because I thought it wa about self-discovery , but a friend said , “ No , it ’ s about oral sex ! ” It could be about oral sex , sure ! Intimacy , definitely , but it could be with yourself . It doesn ’ t have to do with another person . In a way I think your analysis is probably the best one , because isn ’ t oral sex self-discovery ? Any experience you have that will give you a new point in your scale of emotion will make any other experience richer because you have a new point of reference .
 Maybe it ’ s about elevating self-care to the level of eroticism ? Not reserving that deep pleasure for a sexual sensation , but something you could experience day to day . Exactly ! That ’ s exactly it . It ’ s like approaching life a if you ’ re seducing it . As if you ’ re seducing yourself , or the other person , or your work , or whatever . Intimacy in every little thing .
 How do you approach life a if you ’ re seducing it ? I feel like I have to work for it every day . It ’ s like starting a little fire : You have to be so careful with it , not force it . You get it going and then you can use it and tend to it and start it back up again .
 Is your fire well tended ? Not at all . I ’ m not in a great place at the moment , to be honest . It ’ s a good conversation for me to have , a good reminder . I maybe need to go back and listen to some of my song myself to figure this out .
 [ How Robyn , pop ’ s glittery rebel , danced her way back from darkness . ]
 Your song are known for intermingling sadness and euphoria . But “ Honey ” is le triumphant than that . I don ’ t think life is that easy anymore . I used to believe it would all make sense if you just powered through . I really don ’ t feel that way anymore at all . I think it ’ s pragmatic — I really don ’ t feel pessimistic .
 The idea of “ self-care ” can seem like a challenge . Post-recession capitalism ha glorified the hustle so much . The society we live in at the moment — we didn ’ t really make it very good , you know ? It ’ s really tough to take care of yourself . Self-care is difficult when you have a 9-to-5 job , and people are on Instagram projecting these image of themselves — we ’ re in a time where everyone ’ s engaged in storytelling in such an aggressive way . Stories are amazing — they ’ re part of what it is to be human — but you have to be aware they ’ re story . That ’ s the problem with capitalism : It ’ s always trying to trick you into thinking there ’ s a purpose for all of this . But you can actually use a story that relates to something more real than buying yourself out of anxiety .
 It ’ s jarring to see people turning themselves into personal brand a part of that storytelling . That ’ s the strange thing about being an artist . There ’ s always a gap between how I see myself and how other people see me . When I wa younger , I felt like it wa easier for me to absorb other people ’ s thought about me , and more complex to understand what wa me and what wa other people , and how to respond to those expectation . I ’ m still learning that . I ’ ve been more specific with my expression on this album than I ’ ve been able to be before , but I ’ m aware that that doesn ’ t mean that people understand me . I don ’ t even know if that ’ s the point .
 A lot of today ’ s pop is about nihilism , depression , anxiety . There ’ s real sadness behind your album , too . It struck me a something that ’ s easy for the industry to exploit . Definitely : Pop at the moment is depressing . Hip-hop is really dark . The music kid are listening to is heavy ! Maybe it ’ s hard to be positive and optimistic at the moment , for a lot of young people — the number of voice that are trying to share this space in their brain is crazy . But maybe it ’ s cool that they get to explore their darkness a a collective earlier in life , because maybe it will also get them to the point where they ’ re letting go of it early a well .
 Is the industry set up for artist to be able to share their pain but protect themselves ? It ’ s really difficult for anyone to not be exploited in our society a a whole . As an artist , you ’ re exposed , because you deal in emotion all the time . People want you to be vulnerable . If you think about sport — you look at it because someone ’ s pushing themselves to their limit . If you don ’ t risk anything , why would people want to see it happen ?
 You turn 40 this June . You could listen to “ Honey ” a a celebration of the richness that come with age , and maybe aging a a woman . I think it can be that , for sure .

 Who knew that flamenco — and a medieval love-gone-wrong tale — could be so relevant ?
 By MARTA BAUSELLS
 It wa hard to tell how many people in the club liked flamenco , an art form not much associated with young people anymore . But on New Year ’ s Eve in Barcelona , when the palmas hand clap that open Rosalía ’ s “ Malamente ” started pulsing from the speaker , look of recognition flashed from face to face . And by the time Rosalía — an artist from the nearby town of Sant Esteve Sesrovires — started rapping , everyone wa clapping along . Some of the younger girl even twerked .
 It ’ s not unheard-of for flamenco to make incursion into mainstream Spanish pop culture , but Rosalía is different . She sound and feel cosmopolitan , cool in a sophisticated and almost foreign way . She doesn ’ t sound a if she ’ s playing just for u . And indeed , she isn ’ t : This two-and-a-half-minute song , with it balmy synth bass and irresistible syncopation and enticing whisper peppered throughout , ha racked up more than 59 million view on YouTube . Her success , she ha argued , is partly because of listener ’ weariness with the homogenization — which is to say , the Anglicization — of pop . Her own aesthetic is polished , globally recognizable , informed by hip-hop and trap music . But it ’ s also saturated with bullfighting and windmill and fire . Her sophomore album , “ El Mal Querer ” ( which roughly translates a “ loving badly ” ) , is a conceptual project patterned on the subversive medieval text “ Flamenca. ” The last frame of the “ Malamente ” video feature a figure wearing the conical capirote hat worn by penitent during Holy Week — while also riding a skateboard .
 “ Malamente ” ’ s appearance in the club also seemed to inspire a few eye roll . Maybe this is the price of success in a culture that look askance at overt display of ambition or self-actualization , especially by woman . By New Year ’ s Eve , Rosalía had come up in every conversation I ’ d had for day — she wa a interesting to my grandmother a she wa to my 12-year-old cousin . The local fascination tended to focus le on her art and more on her a a phenomenon , on the extraordinary speed of her rise to stardom . It would spark argument too , about cultural appropriation and the Romany community , who have always been closely associated with flamenco .
 “ Malamente ” mean “ badly , ” and the story of “ Flamenca ” is not a happy one . A woman get married to a man who later grows jealous and imprisons her . It ’ s not surprising , these day , that a global star would be singing about such suffering . But Rosalía reminds u that pain and possession are topic that have interested human for century . Millions of her listener must be enjoying this music without understanding the language , but right now , for me , it feel cathartic — soothing , even — to be able to stand in a crowd singing “ badly , badly , so badly ” while clapping my hand .

 Interview by HAZEL CILLS
 Last fall , Marie Davidson , a French Canadian producer of electronic music , released “ Work It , ” an aggressively rattling track on which she serf “ kind of like an M.C./personal trainer , ” exhorting listener not to dance but to work , constantly and sweatily , seven day a week . The song became a minor anthem , and the album it came from , “ Working Class Woman , ” wa embraced a one of the best dance record of the year .
 What sort of place were you at in your life when you wrote this song ? Obviously I wa working a lot . I had already toured Europe and the U.S. , and I wa going back to Europe to play festival . I wanted to make a banger to play live — I just picked up my microphone and started talking . The song came out in a funny way , but the undertone is serious .
 I don ’ t think all people should work all the time . It ’ s sarcastic , it ’ s humorous , but in the joke there ’ s also truth . It ’ s why I say , toward the end , that when I say “ work , ” you have to work for yourself , love yourself , feed yourself . Whatever you do , whatever amount of energy you put into something , you have to do it for yourself and not to please others . Not to build this facade or this persona or achievement .
 Do you think people base too much of their self-worth on their work ? Absolutely . We live in a society that is based on work — goal , achievement , money . Of course ! It ’ s a real problem — workaholism , exhaustion , burnout . We ’ re not taught in this society — it ’ s not valued — to take time and just learn to love yourself . You ’ re taught to be strong , to look smart , to be useful . But I think you become a much more useful person if you learn how to love yourself .
 Do you think people who aren ’ t musician are aware of how physically taxing it can be ? It would be hard to know . When you look at picture or video , it doesn ’ t look like that . It look really fun and glamorous . And it is , sometimes , for a few hour . But it ’ s not a glamorous job being a touring musician . I still have people come up to me after a gig or somewhere , saying : “ You ’ re so lucky . I wish I had your life. ” And I ’ m like : What do you mean by that ? Do you think I woke up one morning and became who I am ? It ’ s year and year of work and trial and error . It ’ s a real job , like being a carpenter or being a designer .
 People think of the dance floor a this freeing space . But you ’ re kind of pointing out that this is just another workplace . For me , at least , it is . It used to be different . When I wa 16 and I started going out in Montreal , going to underground party and raf and club , it wa magical . But it wa different : I wasn ’ t working . It wasn ’ t my job . I wa going there for fun . Even if I wa playing , it wa special . It wasn ’ t in the schedule , where you just do it over and over again . That space is now a work space for me . There ’ s no more leisure . I ’ ve sacrificed that freedom for other thing . Now if I want to feel something mind-blowing or magical , I have to look for it outside of club culture . The music never loses it magic , but the social thing happening at a party or something like that ? No .
 It sound a though the song stemmed from your personal experience , but it feel universal . When I made it , I knew anyone could relate . Because this is the time we live in . Everything go really fast now . People are expected to produce and achieve . It ’ s kind of sad , I think . There ’ s a rigidity in that mind-set about what you should be doing with your life . We ’ re ruled by capitalism , so that ’ s what we get . We are living comfortably , and people feel that they are free , but I don ’ t think that individual are that free in society .
 So how do you make art under capitalism ? I don ’ t care . When I ’ m in my studio composing music , I really don ’ t think about that — about what is the potential of that song , where is it going to take me , what doe it mean to the world . I don ’ t care . I never did . I don ’ t think about my label or my manager or anybody . My insecurity come after , when it ’ s time to be in the world .

 James Blake wa talking about shanzhai , a Chinese phrase that mean , roughly , “ knockoff , ” and that stem from the time-honored tradition in Chinese art of apprentice ’ mimicking their master — “ copying something until you can better it , ” he said , “ or if not better it , compete with it . ”
 Blake , a Grammy-winning avant-gardist with an ear for pop , who ha been playing the piano since he wa about 6 , ha a long list of hero whom he ha studiously copied in pursuit of his own sound . Copying the virtuoso jazz-pianist Art Tatum , the protominimalist French composer Erik Satie and the midcentury gospel maestro the Rev . James Cleveland taught Blake novel way of opening up complex chord structure and fitting them — to gorgeous , aching effect — around deceptively simple melody . Copying singer-songwriters like Joni Mitchell and Stevie Wonder emboldened him to write and sing pop song with increasing emotional candor . Copying the hip-hop producer Timbaland and the South London dubstep craftsman Mala informed Blake ’ s love of distorted timbre — electronic rhythm that skitter and twitch a often a they groove — and of sampling , a technique of literal copying ( and cutting and pasting ) so central to Blake ’ s practice today that , even when he isn ’ t sampling anyone else , he routinely sample himself . “ I ’ ll sit at a piano , improvising ” into a microphone , he explained , then search the tape for building block that he can pluck out and , with editing software , arrange into new composition .
 Blake stand at an imposing 6-foot-6 and carry himself with the deliberateness of a man at risk of scraping his head on doorway . Early in February , in a wood-paneled rehearsal space in the Larchmont neighborhood of Los Angeles , he sat at a Prophet ’ 08 synthesizer opposite Rob McAndrews , a multi-instrumentalist , and Ben Assiter , a drummer , his longtime friend and touring bandmates . At their foot , black cable snaked and cloverleafed among cluster of red- , blue- , silver- and cream-colored effect pedal , like track connecting village in a model-train set .
 Blake is from London , but three and a half year ago he began dating the British comedic actress Jameela Jamil , and when she booked a lead role on the NBC sitcom “ The Good Place , ” he tagged along with her to California . Now Blake led McAndrews and Assiter through a practice run of “ I ’ ll Come Too , ” a swooning new song about joining Jamil out west — about that moment when you want to follow a crush anywhere . The song come from his fourth LP , “ Assume Form , ” which wa released in January . “ That ’ s a fun one to play , ” he said when they finished . “ I really like it . But it ’ s hard — I ’ m singing all the way through , in all these different range , and I don ’ t get a chance to breathe . When I recorded it , I broke the vocal up . ”
 The extent to which Blake ha digested the lesson of his musical hero is illustrated not only by his decade-spanning run of single , EPs and album but also by the number of pop auteur who have collaborated with him . Frank Ocean , Beyoncé , Kendrick Lamar , Jay-Z , André 3000 and Travis Scott are among those artist who have enlisted Blake ’ s assistance . As an influence and a collaborator , Blake ha helped shape two of the more striking trend in contemporary pop : beat that mutate over the course of a song , resisting any traditionally identifiable center , and an emotional atmosphere in which the line between hedonism and melancholy , bliss and despair come undone .
 His influence extends even to artist he hasn ’ t worked with directly . In 2011 , I visited Drake — a pop giant whose entire musical project ha been about smudging the line between hedonism and melancholy — at a converted Toronto warehouse , where he wa working on his second album with his musical right hand , the producer known a 40 . The room wa free of decoration save for 40 ’ s copy of Blake ’ s debut LP , perched on a windowsill like a talisman . Drake later sampled unreleased music of Blake ’ s on a single called “ 0 to 100/The Catch Up. ” Blake , who hadn ’ t approved this usage , got his part removed . At the start of his career , Blake told me , he ’ d been a solitary , “ solipsistic ” bedroom producer . “ I wa so protective of my idea — so militantly and obsessively protective , ” he explained , that it wasn ’ t until year later , when “ I found personal openness , for maybe the first time in my life , that I found collaborative openness , too . ”
 “ Assume Form ” is an album expressly about getting out of one ’ s skull . Five-odd year ago , Blake suffered from a depression so severe that he considered suicide . “ Assume Form ” chronicle his escape from that depression , and it title track , which lead the album , play like a statement of purpose . Blake described it to me a “ a song about intimacy — about feeling like you don ’ t deserve intimacy and feeling like there ’ s no way somebody could really want it with you. ” The song ’ s theme are sex , shame and — by the end — happiness . “ It ’ s by far the most vulnerable , exposed song on the entire record , ” Blake said . “ It ’ s saying , If you ’ re comfortable with this , then the bar ha been set . ”
 Blake wa two and a half week into rehearsal for a tour that would take him around the country and then around the world . He and his band manned a variety of instrument , mostly electronic : the Prophet ’ 08 ; a large , modular synthesizer , studded with knob , plug and blinking light , which McAndrews operated ; and a rubber-covered pad , nestled between cymbal and high-hats , that Assiter thwacked with drumstick to trigger pulse and prerecorded percussive sound . Translating and arranging Blake ’ s intricate studio creation for live concert is a tricky task made trickier still by his refusal to use a laptop . “ With live electronic music , I ’ ve seen the man-checking-emails situation so many time , ” Blake said , referring to that category of lackluster performance in which artist stand unbudgingly at MacBooks , pecking at key . “ I want an audience member to see what ’ s happening . So if Ben is playing the kick and Rob is over here fiddling with knob and it ’ s clear that what he ’ s doing is changing the sound , then it make sense . ”
 The trio consulted a whiteboard upon which the new album ’ s dozen song were listed . “ Should we try ‘ Assume Form ? ’ ” Assiter asked . Blake furrowed his brow . The new album ’ s title track is , structurally speaking , strange . As it lyric switch between optimistic vow of commitment and confession of insecurity , this duality is echoed in the music , which consists of two alternating piano motif — one shimmering , the other overcast . The track began a a long , meandering improvisation from which Blake eventually sampled two disparate chunk , putting them into jarring conversation . When I asked Blake to explain the harmonic unease between these two part , he replied : “ The song essentially modulates from D major in the first section to B flat in the second , which are unrelated key . The first section ha the tonic a the bass note , which give it this firmly rooted presence , whereas the other section ha the third in the bass , which make it feel suspended — which is when the lyric turn to self-doubt. ” He thought for a moment . “ It ’ s quite an odd pairing . It doesn ’ t work , musically . But there ’ s a harmony there . Joni Mitchell doe something similar on ‘ My Old Man , ’ where it go into a minor key when she sings , ‘ But when he ’ s gone . ... ’ ” Complicating thing further , Blake ’ s piano playing on the track wa “ loose — like , microsecond ” offbeat , he said , which would add yet another layer of difficulty when it came to replicating “ Assume Form ” live . “ Let ’ s try something else , ” he told Assiter .
 Blake wa raised by his father , James Litherland , a singer-songwriter and guitarist with a prog-rock pedigree , and his mother , a graphic designer and cycling instructor , in Enfield , a North London suburb . He described his life from adolescence on a largely unhappy , warm and supportive parent notwithstanding . “ I had anger , ” he said . “ A lot of it. ” As a teenager , “ I had terrible acne , and now I think it wa a physical presentation of how angry I was. ” What angered him ? “ My treatment by other people , ” he said . “ People I ’ d been open with . Romantic and personal betrayal . And just a feeling of persecution . I didn ’ t fit in , and I resented not fitting in . I had a couple friend outside of school , so I wasn ’ t totally alone , but I remember year of sitting by myself at lunch . Or just going home because I didn ’ t want to suffer in public. ” Rather than getting out this anger , he repressed it . “ As a child I wa very open and emotionally vulnerable and said how I felt , ” he recalled . “ And I sort of had that beaten out of me — not physically but emotionally . At school , and in British society , there wa this sense of , if you don ’ t behave in the right way — if you ’ re not coolheaded — then people punish you for that . So that wa my childhood , that reflex being stamped out of me . And it stayed with me well into my 20 . ”
 Instead , Blake said , music “ started to be my first language ” and “ talking about how I felt wa second or third. ” In 2007 he enrolled in the Popular Music program at Goldsmiths University of London . As important a his class were the nighttime excursion he took to club like Plastic People and Mass . There , Blake discovered a community of producer and D.J.s — black , white , “ from all part of London , ” he said — who were busy hashing out the oblong dimension of dubstep , a new kind of dance music defined by cavernous reverb , sinister drone and deceptively complex rhythm in which growlingly deep bass line were the primary propellant . Whereas an amped-up version of dubstep soon grew into a global phenomenon , throbbing in GoPro commercial and glitzy Las Vegas club , it wa more subtle in it dynamic at first . Its architect assumed gnomic pseudonym like Coki , Skream and Loefah and tended to direct attention away from themselves and toward the dance floor . “ You can imagine how that appealed to me at the time , ” Blake said .
 On small but influential label , he began releasing his own dubstep-inspired song marked by his sophisticated harmonic sense . Initially he sampled other people ’ s vocal , but later he began singing himself . Blake eventually became comfortable enough to let his voice — a lovely , quaking baritone — ring out clearly , but at first he distorted it self-protectively : “ I intentionally disembodied my voice , ” he said , explaining that “ there ’ s a safety in alteration , because it no longer ha to represent the natural resonance that came out of your chest . ”
 In 2011 , his debut album , “ James Blake , ” wa shortlisted alongside release by Adele and P.J . Harvey for Britain ’ s prestigious Mercury Prize . The album ’ s fan included Bjork , who attended Blake ’ s concert ; Thom Yorke , who dropped Blake ’ s song into D.J . mix ; and Brian Eno and RZA , who collaborated with Blake on “ Overgrown ” ( 2013 ) , which wa also shortlisted for a Mercury ( this time he won ) . Success didn ’ t cure Blake ’ s long-seething unhappiness , however . Around this time , he told me : “ I wa at home , playing PS4 and smoking weed , which I ’ d been doing a lot , and I started to have these hallucination of black . The screen stopped being the game and started being the void . I had physical tremor and panic attack and had to go to my room and just lie there . I started saying thing like , What ’ s the point ? What ’ s the point of me ? ”
 He wa having trouble writing new music , which inspired an existential dread in him . He remembered thinking , That ’ s my only expression a a human being , so I may a well not be here . He never took concrete step to kill himself , he said , “ but I wa thinking about it a lot . Thinking about nothingness . I wa just despondent . It didn ’ t matter to me whether I wa here or not . So I wa at that point . And I wa caught just in time . ”
 It wa Jamil who caught him — she , more than anyone else in his life , Blake said , helped him to break free of his self-destructive tendency , prodding him to speak up when he grew sullen and requiring complete emotional transparency . “ Nothing else will do , ” he said . “ In a relationship , something rot unless there ’ s full disclosure. ” He also saw a therapist specializing in a technique known a eye-movement desensitization reprocessing , or E.M.D.R. , in which a patient recall unhappy memory while moving the eye back and forth rapidly and tapping the hand in time — reconfiguring a relationship to past trauma , in effect , by setting them to a beat .
 Blake ’ s default mode on “ Assume Form , ” which he call “ essentially a pop album , ” is one you might call cautious euphoria . It is also the most collaborative thing he ha put out , featuring guest production from the Atlanta-based hip-hop luminary Metro Boomin and a series of duet with star like Travis Scott , André 3000 and the breakout Catalan singer Rosalía . It would be important , Blake said , when playing these song live , to carve out room for improvisatory run . “ After seven show , you almost feel like you ’ re on rail , and I hate that , ” he said . “ Feeling like I don ’ t have a choice . With tour you ’ re already so tightly scheduled in all other regard , that ’ s when I start to get anxious , feeling like I ’ m locked in . ”
 The band moved next to a song called “ Where ’ s the Catch , ” on which Blake and André 3000 sing and rap , respectively , about what Blake characterized a “ a distrust of really great thing : ‘ Everything ’ s seemingly nice — for today . But what ’ s around the corner ? ’ ” Rather than play André ’ s verse all the way through at concert , the band intended to chop up his vocal and distribute them across the track in stuttering burst . As they rehearsed the song , Blake ’ s vocal , too , were chopped up and fed through McAndrews ’ s synthesizer , where he warped them even further . The trio rode out the song with a jam session , adding layer after layer of noise on their way to a squalling crescendo . Blake ’ s vocal grew increasingly refracted and spectral , and there wa something both frightening and exhilarating about the sound of the electronics swallowing him up whole .

 A shameless polymath pop act delivers the cascading-contemporary-references track we didn ’ t know we needed .
 By STEVEN HYDEN
 ‘ Love It if We Made It ” is a Jedi mind trick . This is the track with contemporary relevance that you ’ re looking for . You will consider it a statement that mimic the nonstop rattle of social medium and the slow drip of Trump-era anxiety . The song , though , is decidedly le subtle than the wave of Obi-Wan Kenobi ’ s hand : Matty Healy , the gregarious lead singer of the English pop-rock band the 1975 , delivers his litany of contemporary pop-culture reference in an impassioned emo-dude howl , over an unchanging and relentless synth-pop stomp that sound like New Order paying homage to the Fall . Donald Trump , Kanye West , Eric Garner , Lil Peep , the failure of modernity , the ubiquity of fake news , Healy ’ s own heroin addiction — it ’ s all accounted for with the maniacal thoroughness of Billy Joel straining to rhyme “ Zhou Enlai ” with “ Bridge on the River Kwai . ”
 But “ Love It if We Made It ” no longer make me think about the Sturm und Drang of right now , or about millennials , or about being extremely online . It make me think of one of the most popular rock band of the ’ 70 and ’ 80 .
 I blame “ Bohemian Rhapsody. ” It ’ s tempting to view the runaway box-office success of the Freddie Mercury biopic — with a worldwide gross of $ 860 million and counting , it ’ s the most popular film about a real-life musician ever made — a an indication that the public yearns for the return of band that will ( stomp ) will ( stomp ) rock you ( clap ) . But overt revival act — like the popular Michigan act Greta Van Fleet , whose member all dress exactly a Brian May did in 1973 — tend not to sonically resemble Queen beyond it first single , the quicksilver Led Zeppelin nod “ Keep Yourself Alive. ” No , the contemporary band that come closest to emulating Queen ’ s whole legacy — a a shameless polymath pop act , willing to try anything , including but not remotely limited to metal , disco , rockabilly , theatrical English music-hall , folk , synth-pop and power ballad that turn unexpectedly into mock-opera freakouts — is the 1975 . ( Perhaps Greta Van Fleet should have called themselves the 1973 . )
 Here ’ s a scene that ’ s not in “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” : In 1978 , while making Queen ’ s seventh album , “ Jazz , ” Freddie Mercury wa inspired to write his own litany-of-pop-culture-references song . He decided that “ Jaws ” wasn ’ t his scene , and he didn ’ t like “ Star Wars. ” He wa also skeptical of God , Peter Pan , Frankenstein and Superman , but staunchly pro-drugs . There wa no such thing a logging off back then , so his symbol of freedom and release wa an old-fashioned one : bicycling . “ I want to ride it where I like , ” Mercury sang , a always committed to nothing else above his own liberation . “ Bicycle Race , ” a worldwide hit , is a perfect example of how Queen routinely violated one of the central truism of rock , later articulated by David St. Hubbins in the 1984 film “ This Is Spinal Tap ” — “ It ’ s such a fine line between stupid and clever. ” The implication is that striving for transcendence is admirable , but it can easily embarrass you .
 [ Can a quote-unquote band drag rock into the future ? The 1975 is trying it hardest . ]
 For Mercury and his bandmates , there wa no line between stupid and clever ; in many of the best Queen song , stupid is clever . It take a special kind of fearlessness to write song about killer queen who are dynamite with laser beam , or fat-bottomed girl who make the rocking world go ’ round , or really fast car that you might want to have sex with . Part of the thrill of listening to Queen is hearing them get away with this sublime silliness , again and again .
 The 1975 have a similar inclination , in the word of Spin magazine , “ to look and sound ridiculous. ” When the band made it debut on “ Saturday Night Live ” in 2016 , Healy pulled out every conceivable louche rock-singer move — he wore leather pant with no shirt , he tousled his curly black Sideshow Bob mane , he stuck out his tongue , he thrust his crotch like Tom Jones serenading an audience of divorcées . And yet there ’ s an ongoing debate a to whether the 1975 should even be considered a “ real ” rock band at all . Its third album , “ A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships , ” is it most willfully diffuse yet , touching on bedroom R. & B. , jazzy torch song , SoundCloud rap , ambient music and lot of other genre that a “ smarter , ” more conservative band would never dream of dabbling in . Last year , when pressed by Pitchfork to explain “ Love It if We Made It , ” Healy posed a delectable stupid-clever rhetorical : “ How weird is reality ? ”
 The 1975 polarizes indie-rock fan — a bloc never comfortable with ostentatious display of self-valorization — but detractor and admirer alike agree on this band ’ s utter absurdity . There may be no other way for a proper rock band to act . At a time when our life are on display like never before , putting u all on the razor ’ s edge of life-changing public shame , how exhilarating is it to see people insist on riding where they like ?

 Growing up mean seeing hero age , rudely , at the same pace a you .
 By LYDIA KIESLING
 In one episode of “ The Office , ” Michael Scott ( played by Steve Carell ) put together a video called “ Lazy Scranton ” to welcome new employee to his branch . In keeping with his character ’ s genius for mangling pop-culture reference , the video is Michael ’ s misguided stab at parodying the viral “ S.N.L. ” digital short “ Lazy Sunday , ” wherein Andy Samberg and Chris Parnell rap about getting cupcake and going to see “ The Chronicles of Narnia. ” Michael ’ s version , which includes line like “ Call poison control if you ’ re bit by a spider/But check that it ’ s covered by your health care provider ! ” leaf the new employee stone-faced . When one of them quits , Michael pleads with him . “ Didn ’ t you think ‘ Lazy Scranton ’ wa funny ? ” “ No , ” the employee say . “ Was it supposed to be funny ? ”
 I thought about this moment when I heard “ Can ’ t Knock the Hustle , ” a song Weezer released late last year . The track , a reimagining of Jay-Z ’ s song by the same title , is the marquee single from the band ’ s “ Black Album. ” I first heard Weezer ’ s version while driving a car , and I almost had to pull over . “ What is happening ? ” I asked .
 The Jay-Z original is about selling drug , with line like “ At my arraignment screaming/All u black got is sport and entertainment , until we even/Thieving , a long a I ’ m breathing , ” with a chorus sung by Mary J. Blige . The Weezer interpretation is about the gig economy and unspools in painfully dorky line like “ I ’ m an ugly [ expletive ] but I work hella harder/And you can write a blog about it ” and “ Leave a five-star review and I ’ ll leave you one too. ” The song is unnervingly , relentlessly bouncy . In the video , Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy play a beleaguered ride-share driver . “ What is happening ? ” his face seems to say .
 Earlier this year , the band released an album of actual cover ( “ No Scrubs , ” “ Paranoid ” and “ Africa , ” among others ) , none of which had the overwhelmingly depressing effect of “ Can ’ t Knock the Hustle. ” What is happening with this song ? There ’ s the peculiar comic engagement with the desperate race to the bottom for American employer . There ’ s the white appropriation of black art , a refraction of hip-hop trope that is about one thousand time le successful than “ Lazy Sunday ” ( possibly even “ Lazy Scranton ” ) . And there ’ s the growing-old phenomenon of seeing former hero make choice you don ’ t understand , in a way that make you grapple with all your own previous choice .
 I have to acknowledge that I may be taking “ Can ’ t Knock the Hustle ” personally to an unreasonable degree . Weezer is a band with a fanatical but divided fan base , much of which belief that the band went downhill after it second album , “ Pinkerton ” ( there ’ s even an “ S.N.L. ” skit about this schism ) . I ’ m a Weezer fan who considers her soul to have been irrevocably altered by “ The Blue Album , ” the band ’ s first , which wa big guitar , big harmonization , big falsetto , big emotion . It can still conjure sense memory of decade past — window down , crooning out into the forgiving dusk . Then there wa “ Pinkerton , ” which had , in addition to it big guitar and emotion , big weirdness about gender and race . I look back on my 18-year-old self belting out line like “ You are 18-year-old girl who live in small city of Japan , ” and have , if not regret , question . “ Pinkerton ” now seems like a raw , risky , sometimes repellent work of art , but one that earned it place in the age-old conversation about what is permitted by the artist .
 “ Can ’ t Knock the Hustle , ” on the other hand , sound like an insincere effort to start a conversation that nobody want to have , or at least that nobody want to have with Weezer . The band ’ s recent spate of cover , even the one that rise to the level of “ fun curiosity , ” feel like another race to the bottom in a cultural economy where attention matter more than anything else . ( “ Was it supposed to be funny ? ” I hear the new employee ask . )
 It ’ s not Weezer ’ s fault that I can ’ t let go of the past , but getting older is hard enough without Weezer making you feel it so acutely . “ Can ’ t Knock the Hustle ” fill me with a vague , general regret and an apprehension for what ’ s to come . As the song itself portends : “ The future ’ s so bright I got ta poke my eye out . ”

 What do you do when you can ’ t put off the future any more ?
 By RYAN BRADLEY
 A few year ago , Sharon Van Etten wa interviewing another musician — Mimi Parker , from the band Low — on the NPR program “ All Songs Considered. ” Van Etten , then in her mid-30s , wa thinking about having a kid and wanted to ask Parker , a mother of two , about what it would be like to be a mom and a touring musician at the same time .
 “ My music is the center of my world , ” Van Etten said while setting up a very big question : How doe someone — anyone , but especially an artist — make room in her life for her work , when her work might no longer be the center of her world ?
 “ You just figure it out , ” Parker answered .
 In the year that followed , Van Etten fell in love , pulled back from touring , enrolled in school to study psychology , wa cast for an acting part in the Netflix show “ The OA , ” wrote a movie score , gave birth ( a boy , now 2 ) — and in January released a new album , her first since 2014 .
 The album ’ s title — “ Remind Me Tomorrow ” — come from an Apple computer software-update alert option that Van Etten found herself selecting again and again , a perpetual prompt for something she needed to do and never quite got done . It ’ s a tidy summation of motherhood and artistry and the process of figuring them out , often at the same time , because , well , a lot of the figuring out seems to be figuring out what can wait until tomorrow .
 [ Read about the many life of Sharon Van Etten . ]
 The album ’ s cover is another reflection of ( or on ) this conflict : a photo of a room with two toddler in it , their stuff — toy , clothing , everything — spilled out around them . The image come from the filmmaker Katherine Dieckmann . ( It wa Dieckmann ’ s film “ Strange Weather ” that Van Etten scored . ) Those are Dieckmann ’ s kid amid the chaos . Van Etten recalled in a Vanity Fair interview that when she told Dieckmann she wa pregnant and worried about how she wa going to make motherhood work , Dieckmann pulled out her phone and pulled up the photo . “ You ’ ll figure it out , ” she said .
 “ Remind Me Tomorrow ” is about all the stuff that can ’ t be KonMari ’ d out of existence : life , love , the figuring , the delaying , and the fact that eventually , one day , but probably not today , the time will come to finally do the all those thing the “ remind me tomorrow ” prompt had so imperfectly kept at bay .
 The standout track , the song you want to raise up your fist and loosen your hip to , is “ Comeback Kid. ” It ’ s driving , then sweet , and it ’ s very stripped down . Every minor variation of the refrain seems to offer a new perspective . Sometimes when she sings it , Van Etten seems to be talking to an earlier version of herself , “ Come back , kid ! ” Other time , she ’ s talking about someone who is definitely not her : the comeback kid . In the video , Van Etten stand singing a old photo are projected onto her face and body and the wall behind her . The photo are from Van Etten ’ s past , but there ’ s very little that ’ s specific about them . They just look like the past in general . Which is probably the point : The past can be both particular and general , a her decision to use cover art featuring someone else ’ s kid might indicate .
 “ Comeback Kid ” is a song about glancing at our past self while dealing with the whole jumble of conflicting emotion that looking too closely at our past might dredge up . But mostly , it ’ s about the looking itself . It ’ s the looking that ’ s important . The world shift ; you look at the past ; you look at the future . And then what do you do ? You figure it out .

 A saxophone , a tuba and two drum kit combine to create a piece of music that somehow capture the whole history of jazz .
 By MARK RICHARDSON
 Listen closely to the third track from the 2018 studio album “ Your Queen Is a Reptile , ” by the London jazz outfit Sons of Kemet , and you will hear a tenor saxophone , a tuba and two drummer , all moving at great speed . The whole operation sound like four people piled into a wagon tumbling down a hill , just barely in control . Each element contributes equally . Because the bass come from an instrument powered by breath , the darting low end is le of a woofer-pumping presence and more of a song-within-a-song , a melody that you can hum on it own . The saxophone shout back , offering growling rhythmic line with just a pinch of melody . And the dueling drummer build one intensely syncopated beat from part of several — the foundational Caribbean rhythm of the Cuban tresillo , martial snare roll , pinging metallic percussion reminiscent of the roaring Afrobeat of Fela Kuti . Listen without knowing another thing about it , and this is a viscerally overwhelming piece of music .
 Widen the focus , though , and you will learn that the song is called “ My Queen Is Harriet Tubman , ” and that each song title on the album reference a heroic black woman who ha inspired the band ’ s leader , the London-born , Barbados-raised saxophone player Shabaka Hutchings . Maybe that knowledge give the burning intensity of the song — it feeling of joy streaked with struggle — a new dimension . Pull back further and take in Hutchings ’ s place a a central figure of one of this era ’ s most remarkable music scene , sometimes called New London Jazz — an approach that incorporates sound and style from all over the African diaspora , along with locally sourced ingredient from the British electronic underground . Let even more into the frame — say , that Hutchings ha performed with the Sun Ra Arkestra and is now signed to Impulse ! , the imprint that issued major work from artist including John Coltrane , Alice Coltrane and Pharoah Sanders — and then listen again to situate this music within the entire sweep of recorded jazz over the last 100 year .
 All this history is carried inside the song and transmitted by these master musician thorough their instrument . It ’ s a sax , a tuba and two drum kit . It ’ s a tune and an unforgettable beat . It ’ s a call to action and a command to find the dance floor . It ’ s a deeply political piece of music that say a great deal without uttering a word . It ’ s music of this exact moment , built from sound that have bounced back and forth across the Atlantic over century . Sounds that landed here , in a song honoring a woman whose face will , perhaps , on some future Sons of Kemet tour across the United States , be found on a $ 20 bill in Hutchings ’ s pocket , a queen ’ s visage replacing that of the dead president so admired by the current one .
