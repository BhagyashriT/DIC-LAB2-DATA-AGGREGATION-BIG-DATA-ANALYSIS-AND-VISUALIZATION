 `` No one is ever really gone , '' say the voice of Luke Skywalker in the first teaser trailer for `` Star Wars : Episode IX , '' which audience finally learned will be called `` Star Wars : The Rise of Skywalker '' Friday at a fan event in Chicago .
 The closely guarded film from director J.J. Abrams will put an end to the Skywalker saga that began over 40 year ago , but even a character and actor have passed on , the footage shown at Star Wars Celebration suggests that a with all `` Star Wars '' film , death is just a technicality a long time ago in a galaxy far , far away .
 Mark Hamill 's Skywalker may have died at the end of the most recent installment but his voice dominates the teaser trailer , telling someone , possibly Daisy Ridley 's Rey , that , `` this is your fight now . '' And audience got a tantalizing tease from another figure from the past : Emperor Palpatine from the original and prequel trilogy , whose ominous laugh close out the promotional spot .
 Carrie Fisher 's Leia Organa is back a well , despite the actress 's untimely passing in Dec. 2016 , thanks to unused footage from `` The Force Awakens '' which Abrams wa able to craft into it own narrative for this new film .
 `` You ca n't just recast and you ca n't just have her disappear , '' Abrams said . `` The idea of having a CG character wa n't even an option . ''
 He 's currently in the process of editing and adding visual effect to the film which will hit theater on Dec. 20 and said that despite Fisher 's death , `` We 're working with her every day . ''
 `` Princess Leia life in this film in way that is mind-blowing to me , '' Abrams said .
 Abrams wa joined on stage at the event by Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy and actor and droids alike including Ridley , Oscar Isaac ( Poe ) , John Boyega ( Finn ) , Kelly Marie Tran ( Rose ) , Joonas Suotamo ( Chewbacca ) , newcomer Naomi Ackie , who play a character named Jannah , Anthony Daniels ( C-3PO ) and even Billy Dee Williams , who reprises his role a Lando Calrissian in the new film after decade away .
 `` How did I find Lando again ? '' Williams said . `` Lando never left me . ''
 `` Star Wars '' superfan Stephen Colbert moderated the panel , doing his best to get the tight-lipped cast and creator to reveal anything about the film . Although no one cracked under pressure , Abrams did reveal some previously known detail , like the fact that `` The Rise of Skywalker '' will pick up `` some time '' after the event of `` The Last Jedi . ''
 `` This is an adventure that the group go on together , '' he teased , although he would n't reveal whether or not that meant the group on stage or some other combination .
 `` This movie is about this new generation and what they 've inherited , the light and the dark , '' Abrams added . `` As they face this greatest evil , are they prepared ? ''
 Besides Hamill , another person who wa n't in attendance wa Kylo Ren actor Adam Driver . Ren is the son of Han Solo and Leia , making him and his mother the only known Skywalkers left .
 When prodded about what will happen with the complex relationship between Kylo and Rey , Ridley demurred , `` I guess the Kylo and Rey thing , we 'll have to see . ''
 She added : `` I think I can confirm there are no more semi-naked Kylos . '' That 's a reference to the scene of a shirtless Driver in `` The Last Jedi '' that surprised fan .
 Although fan are salivating for any morsel of information , the panelist stayed a vague a possible , and kept thing light-hearted debating question like `` who 's a better pilot : Poe or Han '' and even taking a break so that the audience could sing an unprompted Happy Birthday to Ridley , who turned 27 on Wednesday .
 Kennedy , quoting George Lucas , said however that `` Episode IX '' is indeed the third act of a three-act structure .
 But , predictably , there are still more question than answer when it come to `` The Rise of Skywalker , '' especially what will come after .
 The Lucasfilm and Disney collaboration ha proved to be a lucrative one since Disney purchased the company in 2012 for $ 4 billion . Disney 's first two `` Star Wars '' film , `` The Force Awakens '' and `` The Last Jedi '' and it spinoffs , `` Rogue One '' and `` Solo , '' have already grossed more than $ 4.8 billion at the worldwide box office .
 As of now , there is a future for `` Star Wars '' on the big screen , but detail are sparse and date are non-existent . `` The Last Jedi '' director Rian Johnson is working on a new `` Star Wars '' trilogy and `` Game of Thrones '' showrunners D.B . Weiss and David Benioff are also at work on a `` movie series . ''
 Lucasfilm is expanding it small screen universe too beyond `` The Clone Wars '' with the Jon Favreau-directed series `` The Mandalorian , '' which will be available on Disney 's streaming service , DisneyPlus , when it launch on Nov. 12 , and there will be a `` Rogue One '' spinoff series focused on Diego Luna 's character Cassian Andor . With the company 's acquisition of 21st Century Fox 's entertainment property , too , Lucas ' original trilogy and prequels will also be available on the service .
 But who 's got time to think about the future when there are over two minute of brand new footage from `` The Rise of Skywalker '' to dissect ?

 Nearly 42 year after the release of the original “ Star Wars , ” audience got their first look on Friday at the ninth chapter in this blockbuster science-fiction saga , set long ago in a galaxy far , far away .
 “ Star Wars : The Rise of Skywalker , ” whose title and teaser trailer were released at the Star Wars Celebration convention in Chicago , close out a new trilogy of film that started in 2015 . The first in that series , “ Star Wars : Episode VII — The Force Awakens , ” directed by J.J. Abrams , reconnected viewer with venerable hero like Han Solo ( Harrison Ford ) and Leia Organa ( Carrie Fisher ) while also introducing new character like the mysterious scavenger Rey ( Daisy Ridley ) , the renegade storm trooper Finn ( John Boyega ) and the villainous Kylo Ren ( Adam Driver ) .
 A 2017 sequel , “ Star Wars : The Last Jedi , ” directed by Rian Johnson , caught u up on the fate of the hero Luke Skywalker ( Mark Hamill ) , who had been largely absent from “ The Force Awakens . ”
 The new teaser trailer for the next installment , for which Abrams returned to the helm , begin with a tantalizing glimpse of Rey , alone on a desert planet and wielding her light saber a a mysterious starcraft charge at her . ( Can we presume it is piloted by Kylo Ren , her sometime ally and more frequent foe ? ) The voice of Luke Skywalker is heard to say : “ We ’ ve passed on all we know . A thousand generation live in you now . But this is your fight . ”
 There are all-too-brief look at character new and old , including Billy Dee Williams a the interstellar cad Lando Calrissian and Carrie Fisher , who died in 2016 , a Leia , using footage shot for “ The Force Awakens. ” A piece of onscreen text vow : “ The saga come to an end . ”
 And then there is a mysterious , villainous laugh , coming from an unseen figure . ( Disney confirmed on Friday that this wa indeed the cackle of the actor Ian McDiarmid , who will reprise his “ Star Wars ” role a the nefarious Palpatine in this new movie . )
 The new film is scheduled for release on Dec. 20 .
 This is at least the third time fan have been promised closure to the long-running narrative of the Skywalker clan : Everything looked well and fine at the end of George Lucas ’ s “ Return of the Jedi ” in 1983 , which wrapped up the classic original “ Star Wars ” trilogy . Then Lucas had to go and make a second trilogy of not especially beloved prequel film , telling the story of Anakin Skywalker ’ s metamorphosis into the sinister Darth Vader , which concluded in 2005 with “ Star Wars : Episode III — Revenge of the Sith . ”
 But that bargain wa altered after Disney acquired Lucasfilm and it “ Star Wars ” franchise in 2012 , leading to the new trilogy and stand-alone movie like “ Rogue One ” and “ Solo. ” At present , people like Johnson , a well a David Benioff and D.B . Weiss ( the showrunners of “ Game of Thrones ” ) , are developing their own “ Star Wars ” movie that will chronicle new character and plot line .
 So you can expect the larger , post-Skywalker franchise to continue until the heat death of the universe . As Luke say near the end of the teaser trailer , “ No one ’ s ever really gone . ”

 Endangered Spaces
 Once a theater of staggering beauty , the long-shuttered RKO Keith ’ s in Flushing may soon be demolished .
 135-35 Northern Boulevard , Queens
 Endangered Spaces is celebrating beloved neighborhood institution that are fighting to stay open in an era of relentless change . Tell u a space we should feature , and send u your memory , at endangeredspaces @ nytimes.com .

 It never really mattered what movie wa playing at the 3,000-seat RKO Keith ’ s Theater in Flushing , Queens . The main attraction wa always the theater itself .
 “ It wa enormous , a true movie palace , ” recalled Jim Driscoll , 74 , a lifelong Flushing resident . “ They had a blue ceiling with special light that looked like twinkling star . ”
 Wendy Antos-Baker , 70 , who life in Whitestone , Queens , said that “ it had a very , very ornate , lobby — it wa almost ostentatious , unlike any theater you ’ d see today . ”
 Even though it closed in 1986 and ha been deteriorating ever since , many devotee have fought to preserve the RKO Keith ’ s , even a it wa flipped among developer seeking to demolish it and transform it into residential or commercial property .
 The latest attempt — by Xinyuan Real Estate , a Beijing-based developer — seems to be underway and the RKO Keith ’ s day finally may be numbered .
 “ Every developer that came before u wa playing game , looking to flip it , or slap up some building real fast , ” said Eugene T. Kelty Jr. , the chairman of the local community board . “ Everyone took their profit and moved on . This is the only one who really want to develop it . ”
 The movie palace , Mr. Kelty said , wa lovely , with an organ near the stage for pre-film entertainment .
 But , he added , it time ha passed .
 “ It wa a beautiful theater , I ’ ll give you that , but people want to go back in time and bring it back , which is a nice wish , but it ’ s just not happening , ’ ’ Mr. Kelty said . “ Too much of it is already destroyed . ’ ’
 Still , Richard Thornhill , a local preservationist , said that even in it decimated state , the theater can still be restored with help from photograph and by using the still-intact plan of it original designer , the renowned theater architect Thomas W. Lamb .
 Mr. Thornhill ha helped collect about 4,400 signature on a petition to convince the developer to build around the theater and enable a renovation that would put Queens on footing with other borough that have restored historic theater , including Kings Theater in Brooklyn , Paradise Theater in the Bronx and St. George Theatre on Staten Island .
 “ Everything in the Keith ’ s theater wa beautiful — the candy stand in the lobby , even the bathroom . They had an organ player , and they ’ d always run two movie , an A movie and then a B movie . It ’ s a shame that these big theater are really all gone now . ”
 — Jim Driscoll , 74
 The RKO Keith ’ s opened in 1928 , and served partly a a vaudeville house for performer , including the Marx Brothers , Mae West , Bob Hope and Judy Garland .
 Several generation saw their first film at the RKO Keith ’ s and attended local beauty contest and high school graduation there .
 “ We didn ’ t have television yet , so going to this magnificent movie house wa a big deal , ” said Claire K. Shulman , 93 , who wa the Queens borough president from 1986 until 2002 . Her last visit wa to see the 1979 sci-fi horror film “ Alien ” in a mezzanine where the air wa thick with marijuana smoke .
 In it final year , the RKO Keith ’ s became a multiplex , and after it closed , much of the interior wa gutted or damaged by vandalism , flooding and fire .
 Boarded and bricked up , scarred with graffiti , it ha languished a downtown Flushing ha shifted from a largely white , middle-class neighborhood to one of the city ’ s largest Chinatowns .
 In 2016 , Xinyuan bought the theater for $ 66 million with plan to turn it into a 16-story modern glass tower , with commercial space on lower floor and condominium above .
 A Xinyuan spokesman said that plan would be modified “ to meet the market demand a well a government requirement , ” but gave no further detail .
 Xinyuan ha gotten required approval from the city ’ s Landmarks Preservation Commission because the theater ’ s ticket lobby and foyer are protected a city landmark .
 Ms. Antos-Baker remembers studying the lobby one evening in 1977 after she walked out of “ Star Wars ” and waited for her friend who had remained inside watching the movie .
 “ I know most people loved ‘ Star Wars , ’ ’ ’ she said , “ but I had a better time just looking at the lobby . ”
 NEW YORK CITY is known around the world for the big stuff — iconic guidebook attraction like the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty . But New Yorkers know that the city ’ s essence lie in the smaller , neighborhood place that make up it unique fabric . If not well known , they are certainly well loved : the local dive bar or diner ; the quirky Laundromat ; the tiny shoe repair shop . And while the city is always in transition , the change these day seems relentless . Beloved spot are succumbing to high rent and are often replaced by chain business . Here then is a celebration of place that are closing ( or just hanging on ) .
 “ I wanted it to be a laboratory . ”
 “ These kind of comic shop are shutting down left and right . ”
 “ It ’ s been a comfort station for the neighborhood . ”
 “ Too much of it is already destroyed . ’ ’
 “ This is the Cheers of Park Slope . ”
 “ It ’ s been a true community effort . ”

 On May 1 , Disney park in Florida and California will become smoke-free , the company announced on Thursday .
 Visitors who want to smoke at it theme park property , including Walt Disney World , the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex and two water park in Orlando , a well a Disneyland and the Downtown Disney District in Anaheim , Calif. , will have to do so at designated location outside the security area , according to a post on the Disney Parks blog .
 “ As we expand our offering , we continue to take step to enhance the guest experience and make it more enjoyable for everyone who visit , ” Liz Jaeger , a Disney spokeswoman , said .
 It will be up to Disney employee to enforce the ban , she said .
 “ Employees will ask anyone caught smoking to leave the park and smoke in a designated area , ” Ms. Jaeger said .
 The new policy , which doe not apply to Disney park in France , China and Japan , wa greeted with widespread praise .
 Dennis Speigel , the president of the consulting company International Theme Park Service , said Disney chose “ the right course . ”
 “ You ’ re going to the most wholesome , family-oriented place on the planet , ” he said . “ Who want to run into somebody smoking ? ”
 The smoking ban will “ ratchet up the bar for the industry , ” he added . “ Other park operator will follow suit . ”
 A spokeswoman for Cedar Fair Parks , which owns and operates about a dozen amusement park across the country , said she wa “ not aware of any plan for an all-out smoking ban ” by her organization . A representative from Six Flags Great Adventure did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
 On Thursday , a visitor in a soon-to-be extinct smoking area in Florida ’ s Magic Kingdom Park wa not pleased .
 “ It ’ s not fair , ” Denis Morissette told The Orlando Sentinel . “ It ’ s legal . I think people who smoke should smoke if they want to smoke . ”
 Conscious of it image a a family-friendly company , Walt Disney ha slowly curbed tobacco use in recent year .
 In 2015 , it became the first major Hollywood studio to cut portrayal of cigarette smoking from film geared toward younger audience .
 At a shareholder meeting that year , Disney ’ s chief executive , Robert A. Iger , announced that Walt Disney Studios would “ prohibit smoking in movie across the board , Marvel , Lucas , Pixar and Disney film ” because it “ wa the right thing for u to do . ”
 Smoking ha already been restricted in most section of the park , and designated smoking area inside the property have been dwindling . Guests can be charged between $ 250 and $ 500 in cleaning cost if they smoke inside the company ’ s hotel room , on patio or on balcony .
 The latest move come ahead of the public opening of Star Wars attraction that are expected to draw throng of tourist . At Disneyland in California , the 14-acre Star Wars construction site swallowed up the last remaining smoking area , according to the news site Theme Park Insider .
 In preparation for long line of Chewbacca and Darth Vader fan coming for the new Star Wars : Galaxy ’ s Edge space , the park is also banning stroller wagon and large stroller starting May 1 .
 Dry ice , which some parkgoers use to keep drink cool , is also prohibited beginning Thursday .

 SAN FRANCISCO — Disney raised the curtain on a hotly anticipated video steaming service that 's aiming to topple industry pioneer Netflix , once a valuable ally of the Magic Kingdom .
 The service , called Disney Plus , ha been in the work for more than year , but Thursday marked the first time that the longtime entertainment powerhouse ha laid out plan for it attack on Netflix and a formidable cast of competitor , including Amazon , HBO Go and Showtime Anytime .
 Disney Plus will roll out in the U.S. on November 12 at a price of $ 6.99 per month , or $ 69.99 per year . That 's well below the $ 13 monthly fee Netflix charge for it most popular streaming plan , signaling Disney 's determination to woo subscriber a it vies to become a major player in a field that ha turned `` binge watching '' into a common ritual .
 Like Netflix , Disney Plus will be free of ad . Subscribers will be able to download all of the show and movie on Disney 's service to watch offline .
 Netflix will still have a far deeper video programming lineup after spending ten of billion of dollar during the past six year on original show such a `` House of Cards , '' `` Stranger Things '' and `` The Crown . ''
 But Disney Plus will be able to draw upon a library of revered film dating back several decade while it also forge into original programming . Its animated classic , including `` Aladdin '' and `` The Jungle Book '' will be available on the service when it launch .
 New show already on tap include `` The Mandalorian , '' the first live action `` Star Wars '' series , created by Jon Favreau ; a prequel to the `` Star Wars '' film `` Rogue One , '' starring Diego Luna ; a series about the Marvel character Loki , starring Tom Hiddleston ; a rebooted `` High School Musical '' series ; and a new documentary series focused on Disney .
 Disney is approaching the streaming industry from a `` position of strength , confidence and unbridled optimism , '' CEO Bob Iger said Thursday . Iger ha led the company since 2005 and expects to step down when his contract end in 2021 .
 The service 's entire lineup will cover five category : Disney , Pixar , Marvel , Star Wars and National Geographic .
 Although Disney ha an enviable track record of producing show and film that attract huge audience , it attempt to build it own Netflix is risky . To make the leap , Disney ended a lucrative licensing relationship with Netflix , which had become the video streaming home for it latest film after their theatrical release , a well a many of it TV series and classic movie .
 But now movie that came out in 2019 , and going forward , will be streamed only on Disney Plus . That includes `` Captain Marvel , '' which came out earlier this year ; `` Avengers : Endgame , '' which debut in late April ; and the upcoming `` Toy Story 4 , '' live-action movie `` The Lion King '' and `` Aladdin ; '' and `` Star Wars Episode IX . ''
 In many way , it 's hard to compare Netflix with Disney because of the widely different type of show each offer , said eMarketer analyst Paul Verna .
 `` The interesting thing is both company have ended up in the same place , but they 've come to it from vastly different background , '' he said .
 Disney will also contend with a new streaming service from Apple , which is expected to be released in the fall . Apple ha not yet said how much it service will cost or when exactly it will launch .
 Last month , Disney completed it biggest deal yet with it $ 71 billion acquisition of Fox 's entertainment business . The first 30 season of `` The Simpsons '' will now stream exclusively on Disney Plus .
 The Fox takeover help Disney tighten it control over TV show and movie from start to finish — from creating the program to distributing them though television channel , movie theater , streaming service and other avenue . Disney will also get valuable data on customer and their entertainment-viewing habit , which it can then use to sell advertising .
 The Fox deal also gave Disney a controlling stake in Hulu . Iger ha said Hulu will continue to offer general entertainment programming while Disney Plus will be focused on family fare .
 Along with it strong brand , Disney ha the advantage of having a clear strategy for each of it streaming service , Verna said , including Disney Plus , Hulu and ESPN Plus . Disney executive hinted the company would `` likely '' bundle the three at a discounted price , but declined to give more detail .
 Terminating it deal with Netflix will cost Disney about $ 150 million in licensing revenue alone during it current fiscal year ending in September .
 Disney is betting it new service will quickly offset that . By dangling a mix of familiar franchise and beloved animated classic , along with original programming , it figure the new service will be irresistible to family , even if they already subscribe to other service . It expects Disney Plus to be profitable during it 2024 fiscal year .
 The plunge into video streaming is likely to confront Disney with new challenge . One of the biggest dilemma will center on how long Disney wait after a new film 's theatrical release to make it available on it new streaming service .
 Disney said movie would become available on it streaming service only after the traditional theatrical release period and home movie debut , which includes DVDs and purchasing streaming video . That put it schedule behind that of some competitor . Netflix film such a the award-winning `` Roma '' and `` The Ballad of Buster Scruggs '' have either become available for streaming on the same day or just a few day after their short run in theater .
 With nearly 140 million worldwide subscriber , Netflix already ha proven it mettle while warding off one competitive threat after another in the 12 year since it pivoted from DVD-by-mail rental to video streaming .
 Now , Netflix is locking horn with a company that ha been steadily expanding upon it Disney franchise during a shopping spree that ha seen it snap up other major studio .

 BURBANK , Calif. — The Walt Disney Company ha been talking about plan to start a Netflix-style streaming service for two year . On Thursday came the big reveal .
 D-Day , a some in Hollywood called it .
 In a lavish presentation on the Disney lot , Robert A. Iger , Disney ’ s chief executive , offered long-awaited detail about his counterattack on the tech giant that have moved into the entertainment business . The linchpin is Disney Plus , a new subscription video service dedicated to movie and show from Disney , Pixar , the “ Star Wars ” franchise , National Geographic and Marvel .
 Disney Plus will cost $ 7 a month and arrive on Nov. 12 . ( Netflix ’ s cheapest plan is $ 9 , and it standard plan is $ 13 . ) Disney said it intended to roll out the streaming service in Europe and Asia starting next year . It expects subscriber to total 60 million to 90 million by 2024 .
 “ We are all-in , ” Mr. Iger said .
 In it first year , Disney Plus will offer 10 original film and 25 original series , including three “ Avengers ” spinoffs . Disney announced that all 30 season of “ The Simpsons ” would be available on Day One , along with nearly all the “ Star Wars ” movie , the entire Pixar library and family-focused movie and show from it Fox library like “ The Sound of Music ” and “ Malcolm in the Middle . ”
 To market Disney Plus , the company vowed to use the full reach of it empire a it ha never done before , starting with a “ Star Wars ” fan convention in Chicago this weekend . Disney will also mobilize it cruise line , global theme park , retail store , hotel and television network , including ESPN and ABC .
 The presentation , inside Soundstage 2 , home to the original “ Mickey Mouse Club , ” began with a 14-minute sizzle reel highlighting Disney ’ s vast library , which now includes Fox movie like “ Titanic , ” “ Avatar ” and “ Alien. ” Mr. Iger called the library “ a treasure trove of long-lasting , valuable content ” that “ no other content or technology company can rival . ”
 Mr. Iger added , “ It wa important to remind you that we ’ re starting from a position of strength , confidence and unbridled optimism . ”
 The moment amounted to a turning point in the streaming war . For the first time , a traditional medium company demonstrated the firepower needed to compete with Silicon Valley in the fast-growing realm of online video .
 Disney ’ s plan could have failed to impress , along the line of what happened to Apple last month when it staged a similar event focused on it streaming ambition . Apple trotted out celebrity but offered few specific — nothing on pricing , no launch date , barely any footage .
 Disney ha a mixed track record with technology , struggling to find a winning strategy with video game and failing to capitalize on tech-related acquisition like Maker , a YouTube-based video supplier .
 Unlike Apple , Disney unveiled footage from original show and film that are headed to Disney Plus . One live-action series is called “ The Mandalorian. ” Set in the “ Star Wars ” universe and created by Jon Favreau , the show cost an estimated $ 100 million for 10 episode , on a par with earlier season of HBO ’ s extravagant “ Game of Thrones . ”
 Disney also demonstrated the Disney Plus app . The simple user interface , with movie and television tile arranged against a dark background , will look familiar to any Netflix , Amazon or Hulu user . There will be “ recommended for you ” row of suggested show and movie , a well a the option to “ continue watching ” program .
 There will be tile dedicated to the Disney brand , including Pixar , ‘ Star Wars ’ and National Geographic . Each time a user hovers over a brand tile , an animated image is set off — firework blasting behind the Magic Kingdom for the Disney tile or a comic book flip for Marvel .
 Users can make a personalized avatar using character from Disney ’ s intellectual property , including Buzz Lightyear and Moana .
 While the three-and-a-half-hour presentation ’ s target audience wa Wall Street — analyst were invited to attend — the presentation wa also aimed at potential Disney Plus subscriber . Disney also discussed it broader streaming business , which includes Hulu , ESPN Plus and Hotstar , which ha 300 million monthly active user in India .
 Disney will “ likely ” bundle it disparate service at a discounted price , according to Kevin Mayer , chairman of the company ’ s Direct-to-Consumer and International division . Mr. Mayer said that Disney wa “ actively evaluating ” international strategy for Hulu , which currently operates exclusively in the United States . ( Unlike Netflix . )
 Will Disney greatly expand Hulu ’ s budget ? Randy Freer , the chief executive of Hulu , said it planned to expand original program but did not say by how much .
 With Disney ’ s acquisition of much of 21st Century Fox , it now owns 60 percent of Hulu , giving the service a majority owner for the first time in it history . ( The other company with ownership stake include Comcast , at 30 percent , and AT & T ’ s Warner Media . ) Hulu now ha 25 million subscriber . Disney said it expected Hulu ’ s subscriber number to reach 40 million to 60 million in five year , and to be profitable by 2023 or 2024 .
 Most analyst have sky-high expectation for Disney Plus , which the company style a Disney+ .
 “ Our confidence in the resilient success of Disney+ come from the company ’ s unmatched brand recognition , extensive premium content and unparalleled ecosystem to market the service , ” Alexia Quadrani , an analyst at J.P. Morgan , wrote in a recent report . Bank of Montreal and Cowen and Company both upgraded Disney ’ s stock ahead of Thursday ’ s presentation .
 Mr. Iger ha spent year laying the groundwork for Disney Plus . In 2015 , a Netflix grew at a blistering rate , Disney began experimenting overseas with an app called DisneyLife . Rolled out in Britain , DisneyLife offered old movie and television series , child ’ s e-books , game and music . Without new movie , or at least exclusive content , interest wa limited .
 In 2016 Mr. Iger started talking more openly about needing to develop a streaming business — a risky proposition for a company with vast traditional television holding . Disney paid $ 1 billion for a 33 percent stake in BamTech , a streaming service company , eventually paying $ 1.58 billion more for majority control .
 Mr. Iger announced in summer 2017 that Disney would introduce it own Netflix-style service and stop selling movie rerun right to Netflix , forgoing hundred of million of dollar in revenue . In 2018 came Disney ’ s $ 71.3 billion purchase of 21st Century Fox asset , including National Geographic and the Fox movie studio . Mr. Iger positioned the acquisition a supercharging Disney ’ s move into streaming .
 Michael Nathanson , a medium analyst at MoffettNathanson , estimated in a report on Tuesday that Disney Plus could lose a much a $ 1.8 billion annually through 2023 , with programming a one major expense . Add in loss from Hulu and ESPN Plus and Mr. Nathanson expects Disney ’ s streaming division to lose roughly $ 3.8 billion this year and next .
 At least nine new movie are in production or advanced development for Disney Plus , with budget ranging from $ 20 million to $ 60 million . Disney is remaking two musical from it animation library a live-action film : “ Lady and the Tramp ” ( 1955 ) and “ The Sword in the Stone ” ( 1963 ) . Other new movie include “ Togo , ” a period adventure about a sled dog ; “ Noelle , ” starring Anna Kendrick a Santa ’ s daughter ; and an animated “ Phineas and Ferb ” movie .
 Marvel Studios is working on three Disney Plus show . One will focus on Loki from the “ Avengers ” movie , with Tom Hiddleston reprising the role . Another “ Avengers ” star , Elizabeth Olsen , will reprise her Scarlet Witch character in a second series . A third show will be associated with “ Captain America : The Winter Soldier , ” with Anthony Mackie returning a the Falcon .
 Also in the work are episodic spinoffs of Disney franchise like “ High School Musical ” and “ Monsters , Inc. ” Additionally , Disney is working on 10 unscripted show , including a Disney-themed cooking competition , “ Be Our Chef , ” and a series called “ Encore ! ” that reunites the cast of high school musical long after graduation and asks them to recreate their performance .
 Roughly 500 film from Disney ’ s library , including new movie like “ Captain Marvel , ” and 7,500 episode of old Disney-branded television show like “ Hannah Montana ” will anchor Disney Plus .

 Senator Mike Lee of Utah on Wednesday gave a speech on the Senate floor that wa sarcastic to the point of absurdity . In a sendup of the Green New Deal , a sweeping climate proposal put forward by left-wing Democrats , Lee used an image of Luke Skywalker riding a Tauntaun in a “ Star Wars ” film , a well a a painting of President Ronald Reagan on a dinosaur .
 Stephen Colbert mimicked his technique , breaking out an easel , picture and his own “ Star Wars ” reference . “ Senator Lee , you ’ re the most embarrassing part of a storied American institution . You , sir , are the Jar Jar Binks of the Senate , ” he said , unveiling a picture of the reviled character .
 Later , Colbert flipped to an image of Mr. T firing a crossbow while riding on the back of a giant sloth . “ Why , you ask ? ” he said . “ Because my graphic team went and got high . ”
 Samantha Bee analyzed the fallout this week from the release of Attorney General William P. Barr ’ s letter summarizing the Mueller report .
 She wa particularly bothered by a letter sent by President Trump ’ s 2020 campaign to TV producer , suggesting that they should refuse to bring on their show certain Democrats who endorsed the idea that Trump had colluded with Russia ’ s election interference .
 “ Wow . Usually when he writes to TV producer it ’ s to ask them to hide footage of him saying the N-word. ” — SAMANTHA BEE
 She also accused Barr of omitting some important information :
 “ Mueller wa tasked with discovering whether Trump or his circle were under the sway of a foreign adversary , and we still have no idea what he found . Barr didn ’ t mention it at all — which is something , considering that he already quoted the Mueller report a selectively a a review on the poster for a [ expletive ] movie . ‘ “ Transformers 8 ” is a giant piece of … movie ! ’ ” — SAMANTHA BEE
 Colbert poked fun at Trump for doubling down on his fight against the Affordable Care Act now that the Mueller inquiry is over . Colbert said it wa a poor strategic decision at best .
 “ He ha been rope-a-dopin ’ this Mueller thing , O.K. , for two year — and now he finally ha a chance to get on America ’ s good side . Step 1 : Take away everyone ’ s health care. ” — STEPHEN COLBERT
 “ Mr . Trump ! You ’ ve just been cleared of collusion . What are you going to do now ? [ impersonating Trump ] ‘ I ’ m gon na roll a diabetic off a cliff . C ’ mon sweetness , let ’ s go. ’ ” — STEPHEN COLBERT
 “ He ’ s a concert pianist and speaks seven language — including Norwegian , which he learned just so that he could read Norwegian book . Compare that to America ’ s current president , who ha read zero book and is fluent in zero languages. ” — TREVOR NOAH , on the Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg
 “ There wa a new survey , and according to this survey , last year , in 2018 , Americans made almost $ 40 billion worth of purchase while drunk . More than a quarter of American adult , about 53 million people , said they bought thing while under the influence . Which could explain the popularity of Uggs. ” — JIMMY KIMMEL
 As Jimmy Kimmel continues to troll Gonzaga University , a few academic official from the school visited his show .
 Bee also offered a lengthy takedown of Mick Mulvaney , the White House chief of staff .
 Marsai Martin , who first starred in “ Black-ish ” when she wa just 10 year old , ha a new movie in theater : “ Little , ” in which a despotic bos is transformed into a 13-year-old version of herself .

 Those who targeted the new superhero film were , in part , incited by comment made by it star , Brie Larson , who called it a “ big feminist movie . ”

 “ This is not a revolution , it ’ s a restoration . Girls have always read comic . ”
 — Kelly Sue DeConnick , the comic book writer whose reimagining of Captain Marvel wa the basis of the new film
 Trolls tried to torpedo the new “ Captain Marvel ” movie — but in the end , the shero Carol Danvers ( who ’ s been Captain Marvel in the comic book since 2012 ) prevailed . The film sailed past $ 500 million in ticket sale in it first week .
 ICYMI : Within hour of the movie ’ s release on March 8 ( International Women ’ s Day ) , in what appeared to be a concerted effort , some 58,000 online review of “ Captain Marvel ” had tanked it rating on Rotten Tomatoes — leaving the film with an abysmal score of around 30 percent .
 Rotten Tomatoes fixed the problem by that afternoon , removing about 50,000 of the review , which the site said had been written before the film wa released . Among other measure , the site swiftly eliminated prerelease audience review altogether .
 “ We ’ re doing it to more accurately and authentically represent the voice of fan , ” the site said , “ while protecting our data and public forum from bad actor . ”
 Now , the movie ’ s audience score is around 62 percent , and the “ Tomatometer , ” which analyzes rating from film critic , is at 79 percent , slightly below the average for Marvel movie .

 But “ Captain Marvel ” is not the only recent female-led film in the comic or sci-fi realm to be swarmed by troll . As my colleague Cara Buckley wrote this week : “ The all-female remake of ‘ Ghostbusters , ’ ‘ Black Panther ’ and ‘ Star Wars : The Last Jedi , ’ which had a diverse cast , all found themselves in the cross hair of armchair critic , some aligned with alt-right group . ”
 Last year , a Facebook group called “ Down with Disney ’ s Treatment of Franchises and Its Fanboys ” posted an event called “ Give Black Panther a Rotten Audience Score on Rotten Tomatoes. ” The group had also claimed responsibility for sinking score for “ Star Wars : The Last Jedi . ”
 Those who appeared to have targeted “ Captain Marvel ” were most likely incited by comment made by Brie Larson , the titular star . Last year , Larson vowed to seek out more underrepresented journalist after noticing she wa being interviewed by mostly white men . She had a similar critique about film critic : “ I do not need a 40-year-old white dude to tell me what didn ’ t work for him about ‘ A Wrinkle in Time. ’ It wasn ’ t made for him . ”
 She also told “ Entertainment Tonight ” that the vision for the film wa clear during an early meeting with Marvel : Make “ a big feminist movie . ”
 Even if the troll tried to stop her , make a big feminist movie she did .

 When “ Game of Thrones ” finally wrap up on May 19 , at least one of the story ’ s central figure would like the end to be the actual end .
 “ Why [ expletive ] with it ? ” Emilia Clarke , the Dragon Queen herself , said recently .
 “ It ’ s a phenomenon that no one ever saw coming , so I completely understand why anyone would be like , let ’ s make 1,500 more since that ’ s a recipe that work , ” she added . “ I just don ’ t think they should . ”
 Pop culture trend and market pressure might ultimately work against her , however , and a prequel pilot is already in the work . So a HBO ’ s biggest ever hit prepares to begin it final season on April 14 , a definitional question hang over it future : Is “ Game of Thrones ” a series ? Or is it a universe ?
 Based on viewing , industry impact and global attention , “ Thrones ” is one of the biggest blockbuster in TV history . But a giant corporation buy one another and plan bottomless new streaming platform in an ever more feverish battle for your eyeball and entertainment dollar , blockbuster are not enough anymore .
 So while there are only six episode remaining in the sprawling saga of Jon Snow , Daenerys Targaryen , Tyrion and friend , we ’ ve likely only begun exploring Westeros .
 Consider “ Star Wars. ” Since Disney bought Lucasfilm in 2012 for $ 4 billion , it ha strip-mined the franchise , conceiving multiple movie trilogy , stand-alone film and TV series , a well a an enormous presence in Disney ’ s theme park . ( Next up for the “ Thrones ” creator David Benioff and D.B . Weiss : A series of “ Star Wars ” film . )
 Or Harry Potter ( like “ Game of Thrones , ” part of the WarnerMedia empire ) , which after the eight film based on the book is now deep into the “ Fantastic Beasts ” prequel series , and also ha tourist attraction all over the world .
 Or the mightiest pop culture universe of all : Disney ’ s Marvel , which later this month will close out the “ Avengers ” filament of the Marvelverse , with “ Avengers : Endgame , ” but in June extend the X-Men branch with “ Dark Phoenix , ” starring Sansa Stark herself , Sophie Turner .
 So wouldn ’ t the phenomenally popular ( and lucrative ) “ Game of Thrones ” be a prime candidate for a similar treatment ?
 The case in favor includes nearly every detail surrounding the show . In February , AT & T received final clearance for it $ 85.4 billion merger with HBO ’ s corporate parent Time Warner , and will launch a WarnerMedia streaming platform to compete with coming service from Disney — which also just closed a $ 71.3 billion deal to buy 21st Century Fox — and Apple , along with the existing stalwart Netflix , Amazon and Hulu .
 The streaming service will draw from Warner ’ s vast collection of film and show from property like Warner Bros. and Turner a well a HBO . HBO Now , the network ’ s current streaming app , is expected to stick around but HBO ’ s original series and other offering will be incorporated into the WarnerMedia service , meaning “ Game of Thrones ” could appear alongside the like of Harry Potter movie , “ Wonder Woman ” and “ Friends . ”
 John Stankey , the AT & T executive put in charge of WarnerMedia , ha said HBO will get a bigger programming budget in order to ramp up production . “ We want to increase our investment in premium content , ” he said last summer on an earnings call . How much , if any , of that content will be “ Thrones ” -related is an open question . ( AT & T declined to comment . ) But the telecom presumably didn ’ t buy Time Warner just to let one of it most valuable piece of intellectual property go dark .
 “ Thrones ” is also already based on a universe , the Song of Ice and Fire series created by George R.R . Martin , that is so dense with history and lore , it could fuel dozen of series and movie .
 “ The universe is too rich not to try , ” said Casey Bloys , HBO ’ s president of programming . “ But on the other hand , I also don ’ t want to do it just to do it . ”
 The prequel pilot , created by Martin and Jane Goldman , will go into production this summer . Set thousand of year before the event of “ Game of Thrones , ” it will explore the history of the White Walkers and the Stark family , and star Naomi Watts and Miranda Richardson , among others . It wa one of multiple prequel concept commissioned by HBO , which hasn ’ t ruled out moving forward with any of the others at some point .
 And starting next year , “ Thrones ” fan — like “ Star Wars , ” Potter and Marvel devotee — will be able to get their fix in the flesh .
 The Game of Thrones Studio Tour , a 110,000-square-foot tourist attraction , is slated to open in spring 2020 in Northern Ireland , where most of the show wa produced . The project , inspired by Warner Bros. ’ s Harry Potter studio tour outside London , will transform the Linen Mill Studios in Banbridge , where part of “ Thrones ” were shot , into an interactive exhibition of the show ’ s set , costume , prop and weapon .
 “ It ’ s going to be an immersive experience where fan will feel like they are inside their favorite set from the show , ” said Jeff Peters , HBO ’ s vice president for licensing and retail .
 Linen Mill Studios will be the first of a many a four former “ Thrones ” filming location in Northern Ireland to be transformed into interactive fan experience — other possibility include the still-standing set for King ’ s Landing , in Belfast , and Castle Black and the Wall , in a quarry outside the city . While there are not currently plan to create similar attraction in the United States , “ it ’ s possible , ” Peters said . “ We get pitched all the time , and we ’ re open to a lot of different opportunity . ”
 It ’ s worth noting that there are some potential obstacle to “ Game of Thrones ” becoming the next “ Star Wars. ” One is the firmly TV-MA tenor of the series — the risqué material precludes youngster from fueling the franchise a actively a they do for others . ( HBO argues that this will keep “ Thrones ” relevant even if it doesn ’ t add more series , a new generation discover the saga . )
 Another is HBO itself . The network became the crown jewel of television through it taste and commitment to quality ( the occasional “ Arli $ $ ” notwithstanding ) . It ’ s known for walking away from numerous pilot that didn ’ t meet it standard , and will only turn the prequel into an actual series if it life up to “ Thrones , ” Bloys said . “ I want to honor the high bar that Dan and David set with the original show , ” he said .
 As a result , it ’ s way too early to even start thinking of “ Thrones ” a a franchise , he added .
 “ To me , franchise denotes multiple film or multiple TV show living at the same time , ” he said . “ Not having even turned a camera on the prequel just yet , it ’ s premature to say at this point , to declare we ’ re going to have multiple series living at once . ”
 AT & T , however , ha shown no sign of being a hands-off or particularly patient owner . The former HBO chief executive Richard Plepler , a responsible a anyone for the network ’ s taste-making reputation , abruptly left the company two day after the Warner purchase received final clearance .
 There are already sign that AT & T plan to treat “ Thrones ” a one more synergistic cog in it corporate machine . Kristian Nairn , who played the fan favorite Hodor , wa tapped to appear this week at an AT & T store in Boston , where customer could also enter a sweepstakes for a seat on a “ Dragon Wagon ” to the season premiere in New York .
 One faction that is not much interested in any new version of “ Game of Thrones ” : the star of “ Game of Thrones . ”
 None of the current “ Thrones ” actor are involved with the pilot or have had any role in it development . The prequel “ came a a shock to all of u , ” Clarke said .
 The general sentiment from Clarke and others about any future “ Thrones ” series amount to basically , I wish them the best , I had the time of my life , but I ’ m out . ( One exception : the ever cagey Varys . “ Never say never , ” said Conleth Hill , who play him . )
 This isn ’ t terribly surprising , given the length and physical demand of “ Game of Thrones ” — and who know which character will survive the final season ? But the ongoing loosening of TV format would seem to open up plenty of opportunity , even for character that get killed off . What “ Thrones ” fan wouldn ’ t want a mini-series or HBO movie depicting prehistory like , say , Robert ’ s Rebellion and the event that turned Jaime Lannister into the Kingslayer ?
 Nikolaj Coster-Waldau , who play Jaime , hope the prequel is “ even more successful than ‘ Game of Thrones , ’ ” he said . But he ’ s not interested in ever returning to Westeros .
 “ You could only set yourself up for disappointment , ” he said . “ It ’ s been an amazing 10 year , but 10 year is a fair amount of time . ”
 Don ’ t count on a Sansa mini-series either . “ I never want to be in a corset ever again , ” Turner said .
 That said , there could be other opportunity for “ Thrones ” veteran if the show expands into the next great franchise . Its star might be at the pinnacle of the pop culture universe now , a the final season draw near , but some have been around long enough to know how quickly such thing can change .
 “ The cast member that now are so confident about the future , ” Coster-Waldau said . “ Five year from now we will all be guide at the Game of Thrones Land . ”

 Good morning ,
 We start today with Israeli voter ’ embrace of Benjamin Netanyahu , the start of general election in India , and stunning galactic news — the first image of a black hole .
 The election result in Israel prove , once again , that Israelis can not imagine life without Benjamin Netanyahu at the head of government — even if he could be toppled in the month ahead on corruption charge .
 Mr. Netanyahu is widely credited with having built a strong economy and keeping Israel secure . He ha also delivered long-sought diplomatic victory , several of them with the help of President Trump .
 What ’ s next : President Reuven Rivlin is expected to choose , within day , the party leader he belief ha the best chance of assembling a parliamentary majority . Preliminary result suggest that would be Mr. Netanyahu , whose Likud party ha stronger potential partner than the Blue and White alliance of his chief rival , Benny Gantz . Here are the latest update .
 Mr. Netanyahu is almost certain to try to persuade his coalition partner to pas a law granting him immunity from prosecution .
 Political shift : More than a million Israelis voted for Blue and White , a record for a new party , placing it in the position of being the main alternative to Israel ’ s right wing , a spot held for decade by the Labor Party .
 It ’ s the biggest democratic exercise in human history : 900 million eligible voter , at least 11 million poll worker and 2.3 million electronic voting machine .
 The first wave of India ’ s voter hit the poll today to select a new Parliament . The voting will play out over the next five week . The incoming lawmaker will select a prime minister .
 Go deeper : The race is effectively a referendum on Prime Minister Narendra Modi , who is facing a strong challenge by the Congress party . Many Indians believe that his administration ha been more effective , le corrupt and better at positioning India on the world stage than past government . Others think his right-leaning political party , the Bharatiya Janata Party , ha alienated minority and stoked fear .
 Theresa May met with European leader in Brussels to plead for more time to salvage her faltering withdrawal plan . The current deadline is tomorrow .
 European Union official were expected to offer Britain extra time for it departure from the bloc — well beyond the June 30 deadline extension Mrs. May requested .
 If it is pushed to the end of the year , there are factor that could break the current deadlock in London : Parliament approving a deal , a general election , a second referendum or a change of prime minister .
 Voices : Mrs. May ’ s weakness at home and abroad ha not gone unnoted on the Continent . One German publication described her visit to Berlin and Paris on Tuesday a a “ begging tour . ”
 Warning : The International Monetary Fund said that an abrupt Brexit would throw Britain into a two-year recession that would leave it economy 3.5 percent smaller than forecast .
 Astronomers unveiled the first image of a black hole , an object so dense that not even light can escape it gravity .
 The image showed a dark circle surrounded by swirling fog of radio noise in the heart of a galaxy . It affirmed a finding that shocked Albert Einstein when his equation predicted it in the early 20th century : that space-time can collapse when too much matter or energy is concentrated in one place .
 Reaction : “ We have seen what we thought wa unseeable , ” said Shep Doeleman of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics .
 How they did it : Eight radio observatory — spanning six mountain and four continent — observed the galaxy on and off for 10 day in April 2017 . The image emerged after two year of computer analysis .
 Archives : Last October , The Times Magazine discussed the challenge of photographing black hole .
 Huaraz , a Peruvian city of 130,000 , sits about 14 mile below this swelling glacial lake . Many of it resident live in fear that a flood , caused by an avalanche at the lake , could wipe away their home .
 Our Sunday Magazine ’ s climate issue look at how and why a Peruvian farmer ha filed a lawsuit against a German utility company — and what the effort might teach u about litigating a problem a enormously complex a global climate change .
 New Zealand : Parliament passed a law banning most semiautomatic weapon le than a month after the killing in Christchurch . Just one lawmaker opposed it .
 Germany : In one of the highest-profile case against a female member of the Islamic State , a German woman is on trial for the death of a 5-year-old Yazidi girl she held a a slave .
 Russia : From the Altai Mountains to the Pacific Coast , China is ravaging vast woodland while restricting commercial logging in it own forest .
 China : In the Yujiapu Financial District , which promotes itself a China ’ s Manhattan , four-fifths of the office space stand empty , demonstrating a breakdown of the Chinese economic growth model .
 Afghanistan : Dozens of security and Taliban force were killed a violence intensified before another round of peace talk to end the 18-year-old war there .
 Australia : Vegan protest across the country reignited debate about animal cruelty and sustainability , and exposed a societal rift between animal right activist and farmer .
 Japan : The country ’ s military recovered part of an F-35A warplane that disappeared during a training exercise . The pilot wa still missing .
 Snapshot : A smartphone photo , above , taken during a demonstration in Sudan against the repressive regime of President Omar al-Bashir , ha gone viral a continuing protest there reach a new intensity .
 Taiwan : An ophthalmologist removed four tiny sweat bee that were living inside a woman ’ s eye and feeding off her tear .
 What we ’ re reading : Comic strip on Instagram . Michael Roston , a science editor , writes : “ If you really miss the funny page in newspaper of yore , try Instagram . For month my feed ha been dominated by comic made for the medium , and I couldn ’ t be happier . Once you follow a few , Instagram ’ s algorithm will serve up more . Here ’ s a starter pack of three : Strange Planet , Rubyetc and They Can Talk . ”
 Cook : Lemony whipped feta and charred scallion make a perfect spread for pita chip or buttery cracker .
 Watch : If you recently signed up for a Hulu streaming subscription thanks to your Spotify premium account , you may be wondering what to watch . We ’ re here to help .
 Read : “ Normal People , ” Sally Rooney ’ s hugely anticipated second novel , is finally out in the U.S. “ There is , in the pointed dialogue , a reminder of why we call it a punch line , ” our critic writes .
 Eat : The chef Jenny Kwak ha been turning New Yorkers on to Korean food for 25 year . Our critic review her newest restaurant , Haenyeo , in Park Slope , Brooklyn .
 Smarter Living : A computer science professor researched his latest book , “ Digital Minimalism , ” by signing up 1,600 people for a monthlong divorce from the optional online world . He came away with clear guidance on digital decluttering : Remove most apps from your phone , leaving them only on your browser . And the going may get rough , so only the most satisfying analog activity will keep you inspired . Win-win .
 And we ’ ve collected five cheap ( ish ) thing to untangle yourself from smartphone dependence .

 PARIS — Four decade after R2-D2 delivered a vital message from Princess Leia in the hit movie `` Star Wars '' , a French supermarket group plan to use robot inspired by the drum-shaped droid to transport food to customer in Paris .
 Stepping up the race for automated delivery with online retailer such a Amazon , Casino 's Franprix chain will test the delivery robot on the street of Paris 's 13th arrondissement for a year .
 In the French capital , where Amazon ha been running it Amazon Prime Now express delivery service since 2016 , the speedy and convenient delivery of food ha become a battleground among retailer .
 `` This droid will facilitate the life of city dweller . The last mile delivery is crucial . This is what build the relationship with customer , '' Franprix Managing Director Jean-Paul Mochet said of the service , which will be free .
 `` We are going to test three droids in this store . If the test is successful , we may extend it to other Franprix store . ''
 Franprix and it partner , French start-up TwinswHeel which developed the a yet unnamed robot , are running the test after the city 's authority approved the southeastern arrondissement for the experiment .
 The electric vehicle have two large wheel , a suitcase of either 30 or 40 litre and can run for 25km ( 15 mile ) .
 In the initial trial , Franprix will use the robot in store to carry purchase for customer - mainly people with reduced mobility or the elderly - and take the good to their home .
 Using a `` Follow Me '' button on the machine , the robot is paired with customer through visual recognition , so it can follow them in store and on the street .
 R2-D2 CALLING
 Initially , the robot will not go on the street on it own , but will be followed by an operator because Franprix doe not have permission for the machine to travel solo yet .
 For that , legislation need to be changed , Mochet said , adding he hoped that would happen soon .
 In future , Franprix and TwinswHeel hope customer will be able to order good online or in store , and the droid will take them to shopper ' home and announce it arrival by text .
 The message will include a code so customer can unlock the robot 's suitcase and unpack the good .
 Larger robot could also be used by store staff to re-stock shelf .
 Franprix , which made 1.6 billion euro ( £1.4 billion ) of sale last year from it network of 900 store , is not alone with it experiment .
 Last year , U.S. grocery giant Kroger launched an automated delivery trial in partnership with driverless delivery firm Nuro . Having completed the first phase in Scottsdale , Arizona , it recently announced plan to transfer the programme to Houston , Texas .
 In Britain , Tesco and Co-op are testing a six-wheeled delivery robot in Milton Keynes with Starship Technologies .
 ( This story corrects first name of Franprix exec to Jean-Paul in fourth paragraph )

 Let u help you start your day .
 By Melina Delkic
 ( Want to get this briefing by email ? Here ’ s the sign-up . )
 Good morning ,
 We start today with a Brexit delay , a fifth term for Netanyahu and the first image of a black hole .
 European Union leader agreed to push the deadline for Britain ’ s departure from the bloc back to Oct. 31 , staving off a chaotic , no-deal exit that wa set for Friday .
 It wa longer than Prime Minister Theresa May had hoped for — she proposed June 30 , which many found unrealistic . European leader agreed to review the arrangement at the end of June .
 At a news conference after a long night of negotiation , Donald Tusk , the European Council president , said the two side had agreed to what he called “ a flexible extension . ”
 What it mean : Britain will almost certainly have to hold election for the European Parliament on May 23 — something Mrs. May once argued would be absurd , given that Britons voted to leave almost three year ago . That prospect will likely anger hard-line Brexit supporter .
 The path ahead , a you ’ ve probably guessed , remains a minefield .
 Benjamin Netanyahu is on course to become Israel ’ s longest-serving prime minister .
 With nearly all of the vote from Tuesday ’ s election counted , the centrist Blue and White alliance led by his rival Benny Gantz conceded , all but confirming that the country will stay on it conservative course .
 Mr. Netanyahu is widely credited with having built a strong economy and kept Israel secure . He ha also delivered long-sought diplomatic victory , several of them with the help of President Trump .
 What ’ s next : Mr. Netanyahu , who is likely to be indicted on bribery and fraud charge , is expected to try to persuade his coalition partner to pas a law granting him immunity from prosecution .
 Signs of division : More than a million Israelis voted for Blue and White , a record for a new party , making it the main alternative to Israel ’ s right wing .
 Arab perspective : The election underscored that the dream of a Palestinian state is more remote than ever — a is the chance that the United States will help create it .
 The Treasury Department said on Wednesday evening that it would not immediately comply with a congressional request to hand over President Trump ’ s tax return , setting up a protracted legal battle between two branch of government .
 Steven Mnuchin , the Treasury secretary , said in a letter that lawyer needed more time to ass the lawfulness of the request , expressing concern that it would violate taxpayer privacy . It wasn ’ t clear how long the review would take .
 Mr. Trump ha declined to release his return on the ground that the I.R.S . wa auditing him — even though no law prevents a taxpayer from releasing return while under audit .
 Points of contention : Mr. Mnuchin and many Republicans believe that furnishing the return could open the floodgate to weaponizing the Internal Revenue Service . Some Democrats say the language in the formal request for the return doe not give Mr. Trump the leeway to refuse it .
 Astronomers captured the first image of one of the most mysterious entity in the cosmos .
 A black hole is a cosmic abyss so deep that not even light can escape it . This one wa found in the heart of the Messier 87 galaxy , roughly 55 million light-year away .
 The image , showing a dark circle surrounded by a lopsided ring of light , illustrated a finding that shocked Albert Einstein when his equation predicted it in the early 20th century : that space-time can collapse when too much matter or energy is concentrated in one place .
 How they did it : Eight radio observatory , spanning six mountain and four continent , observed the galaxy on and off for 10 day in April 2017 . The image emerged after two year of computer analysis .
 Black hole cinema : If you can ’ t get enough , we rounded up some of the best streamable movie in the black hole canon .
 Huaraz , a Peruvian city of 130,000 , sits about 14 mile below this swelling glacial lake . Many of it resident live in fear that a flood , caused by an avalanche at the lake , could wipe away their home .
 Our Sunday magazine ’ s climate issue look at how and why a Peruvian farmer ha sued a German utility company over global warming — and what the effort might teach u about litigating a problem so enormously complex .
 Sudan : As protester continued to demand President Omar Hassan al-Bashir ’ s ouster , state news medium said the military would “ issue an important statement soon , ” leading to speculation about a possible coup .
 Snapshot : A smartphone snap from the Sudanese protest ha gone viral . The speaker ha since been identified a Alaa Salah , a 22-year-old student , above . Some people have dubbed her the Sudanese Statue of Liberty . “ Her picture ha had resonance far beyond it place of origin , ” our chief fashion critic writes .
 Uber : The ride-hailing giant told some investor that it stock sale might value it at up to $ 100 billion , people briefed on the matter said — below a $ 120 billion valuation that investment banker had floated . Its share are expected to go public next month .
 Germany : Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would remove two painting by Emil Nolde from her office . The true nature of the artist ’ s Nazi past is now coming to light .
 New Zealand : Parliament passed a law banning most semiautomatic weapon le than a month after the mass killing in Christchurch . Just one lawmaker opposed it .
 Travel : JetBlue Airways , the New York-based low-cost carrier , announced that it would begin flying across the Atlantic Ocean , between London and the East Coast of the U.S. , in 2021 .
 2020 : Pete Buttigieg , the gay , Christian mayor of South Bend , Ind. , and a Democratic candidate for president , is using the language of faith to confront the Christian right on territory they have long claimed a their own .
 Holy stair : The marble of a stairwell in Rome said to have been used by Jesus will be revealed to the public for the first time in 300 year . Many who visit the step ascend on their knee , a an act of penance .
 Spoken word : One of our Opinion columnist recorded voice memo to remember column idea and turn of phrase — even full paragraph and outline of his article . He said it revolutionized the way he worked , letting him write the way street photographer shoot — “ out in the world , whenever the muse strike me . ”
 What we ’ re reading : Comic strip on Instagram . Michael Roston , a science editor , writes : “ If you really miss the funny page in newspaper of yore , try Instagram . For month my feed ha been dominated by comic made for the medium , and I couldn ’ t be happier . Once you follow a few , Instagram ’ s algorithm will serve up more .

 WASHINGTON — The 2019 Economic Report of the President run 705 page and feature chapter on “ expanding labor force opportunity ” and “ ensuring a balanced financial regulatory landscape. ” It also claim to be written by Batman .
 For the second straight year , the group of economist that do regression analysis and forecast annual growth rate for President Trump ha slipped a straight-out-of-Comic-Con Easter egg into it annual report .
 [ Not nerdy enough to know what an Easter egg is ? Read here . ]
 The list of Council of Economic Advisers intern on Page 624 of the report includes Steve Rogers ( a.k.a . Captain America ) , Peter Parker ( Spider-Man ) and Bruce Wayne ( Batman ) . There ’ s also Aunt May ( Peter Parker ’ s guardian ; apparently there are no anti-nepotism rule at the council ) , J. T. Hutt ( a superfan abbreviation for Jabba the Hutt , the “ Star Wars ” gangster who hang a frozen Han Solo on his wall ) , the actor John Cleese , Kathryn Janeway ( a “ Star Trek ” captain ) and someone called John Snow ( more on him later ) .
 The name stuck out because most Council of Economic Advisers intern are university student — depending on which movie or comic you prefer , Peter Parker is the only one on the list who fit that bill — and also , real human being .
 A former council economist , Martha Gimbel , who is now research director at Indeed , noticed the name and tweeted about them on Tuesday afternoon .
 Last year ’ s list wa pretty impressive , too , it turn out . The 2018 report included abbreviated reference to a pair of famed “ Star Trek ” captain , James T. Kirk and Jean-Luc Picard .
 The White House say it ’ s all in good fun . The Council of Economic Advisers ’ official Twitter account said late Tuesday that the list wa an effort to call attention to it intern “ super hero , ” who made “ significant contribution ” to the economic report .
 It ’ s worth noting that Jabba the Hutt is not , in fact , a superhero — he enslaved Princess Leia and tried to feed Han Solo and Luke Skywalker to a slow-digesting pit monster in the desert . Also , who is this “ John Snow ” they speak of ? Is he the former Treasury secretary under President George W. Bush ? An actual intern ? Or did the council , in a blow to it nerd cred , misspell the name of the “ Game of Thrones ” hero Jon Snow ?
 The New York Times asked a council spokeswoman to clarify . “ Have a sense of humor ! ” she replied .
 Funny , that ’ s what people usually say to economist .

 Before the force is with them , Keri Russell and Adam Driver , who will both appear in “ Star Wars : Episode IX , ” bring an unruly love story to Broadway .

 Nine floor above Times Square , Adam Driver hurtled through a door — or what would become a door once the set wa fully built — thundering about the traffic , the parking , the trash . “ This street ’ s dying of crotch rot , ” he bellowed .
 “ Do I know you ? ” Keri Russell asked coolly .
 It wa the second week of rehearsal for Lanford Wilson ’ s “ Burn This , ” a combustible 1987 play about the unlikely romance between Anna ( Ms. Russell ) , a serious-minded choreographer , and Pale ( Mr. Driver ) , a hothead restaurant manager . Anna ha a gentlemanly boyfriend , Burton . Pale ha a wife , two kid and a line of cocaine where his superego should be . If you tried to match them on Tinder , your phone might explode . Still , anguish and pheromone jolt them into love or lust or something more relentless .
 “ It ’ s a weird love story , ” Ms. Russell said once rehearsal had paused . “ It ’ s a unique one . It ’ s a good one. ” And it ’ s one that collides two masterly , if hugely dissimilar actor — Mr. Driver , 35 , who brings a Method hyperintensity to every project , even the brash traumedy “ Girls , ” and Ms. Russell , 42 , a former teen star who perfected steely interiority on the espionage drama “ The Americans . ”
 “ Burn This , ” which begin preview at the Hudson Theater on March 15 , wa originally announced with Jake Gyllenhaal attached . ( Other famous Pales : John Malkovich , Edward Norton . ) After some scheduling zigzag , Mr. Driver replaced him . Ms. Russell joined the director Michael Mayer ’ s production last summer , just after she signed on for “ Star Wars : Episode IX , ” the ultrasecret final installment of the current saga in which Mr. Driver play the angsty villain Kylo Ren . Whom doe Ms. Russell play in “ Star Wars ” ? She starred a a superspy for six season . Good luck getting her to talk .
 Mr. Driver , a recent Oscar nominee for “ BlacKkKlansman , ” enrolled at Juilliard after a stint in the Marines and spent his post-grad year in the theater . But “ Burn This ” is his first play since he began shooting “ Girls ” in 2013 . Ms. Russell wa a Mouseketeer and then a fickle college student in “ Felicity. ” She ha appeared in only one other play , Neil LaBute ’ s “ Fat Pig ” in 2004 . Until her partner and “ The Americans ” co-star , Matthew Rhys , talked her into a reading of “ Burn This , ” she hadn ’ t wanted to do another one .
 Ms. Russell and Mr. Driver know each other through Mr. Rhys , who appeared with Mr. Driver in the moody 2012 revival of “ Look Back in Anger. ” The two couple ( Mr. Driver is married to the actress Joanne Tucker ) live just down the street from each other in Brooklyn Heights and are friendly . Which probably explains why , during a brief photo shoot that morning , Mr. Driver messed with Ms. Russell ’ s boot when he wa meant to lie reverently at her foot and why she suffocated him with her shirt just when he wa looking especially sultry . It can be hard to smolder at 10 a.m .
 Once they ’ d collected themselves , they sat down on the “ Burn This ” set to discus big feeling , fierce chemistry and whether or not they cross lightsabers . These are edited excerpt from the conversation .
 Why did you want to work on “ Burn This ” ?
 ADAM DRIVER If I ’ m going to do a play , I like the idea of it being something contemporary , something American , kind of at a fever pitch . I knew this play from before , from Juilliard . I had played Pale , which is embarrassing , a kid in a costume at 23 , being like , “ I know what I ’ m talking about ! ” I had no idea .
 KERI RUSSELL I hadn ’ t been actively searching to do a play . But I thought , I guess I ’ ll do the reading . And then it just felt like such an escape . We ’ re so inundated with all of this political stuff and obviously it ’ s very important . But it felt so nice to read something just about feeling . And it touched me . Everyone talk about the firework of Pale and how crazy he is . But there ’ s something about the relationship that really moved me . I cried .
 DRIVER These people need to live gigantic life in order to feel something . These people want to feel something big . We ’ re not often given that space to feel . Or probably we are , but we don ’ t take it . We ’ re too distracted by everything else .
 RUSSELL Tanya Berezin , she hold the right to “ Burn This. ” Before we started , she came in and said Lanford ’ s character need everything about their life to feel humongous . They wanted to do the best possible art , they wanted to fall in love in the best possible way . Everything had to mean something and it had to be huge .
 And you sort of go , ‘ Well , I did want to do that , but I guess I needed to make money , too. ” Or , “ I did really like that guy , but he wa a lot of work. ” Life move in .
 These character are in so much pain . What ’ s the experience of rehearsing that kind of pain ?
 DRIVER The rehearsal are six hour long . You get in that mind-set for six hour and you go home , you ’ re still pumping , and it ’ s hard to not make everything urgent . My dog will do something pretty mundane and my first impulse will be like , “ WHAT THE — ” [ The rest of Mr. Driver ’ s sentence wa too colorful for publication . ] I ’ m not good at letting thing go . Other people are and I envy that . I ’ m always working . It ’ s always in the back of my mind . There ’ s a benefit to constantly asking yourself question about it . The disadvantage is you drive yourself insane .
 In the play , Anna say that she and Pale are apple and orange . I ’ m not sure they ’ re both even fruit . What attracts them to each other ?
 RUSSELL Pale ’ s feeling are so loud and he ’ s not embarrassed by them , he ’ s not ashamed of them . I know a few people like that and they ’ re so fun to be around . Pale , he ’ s so alive . Burton is a great guy . He ’ s rich and he ’ s polite and he ’ s nice . But he doesn ’ t have the stuff , the excitement . That ’ s what Anna want desperately .
 DRIVER I think there ’ s hopefully a physical attraction , though ——
 RUSSELL I ’ m not going to do that .
 This play only work if we feel that connection , pheromone that hit the back row . How do you find that ?
 DRIVER I don ’ t know if that ’ s something we really work on . I feel like either it ’ s there ——
 RUSSELL Or it ’ s not .
 DRIVER We don ’ t sit around and consciously work on chemistry . We have such affection for each other , but that doesn ’ t really matter . It ’ s what the play is .
 RUSSELL But when someone is truly vulnerable in front of you , there ’ s this immediate connection , an instant intimacy . This crazy first moment where they meet , it ’ s so intimate , so raw . There ’ s definitely an animal thing in this connection . But I don ’ t know that you can work on it .
 Do you think most people want what these people want , to feel overwhelmed by emotion , attraction ?
 RUSSELL Of course ! Yes ! That ’ s what everyone want . Although these day all I want is a hotel room . Alone . Someone to connect with , who care about that ? I want room service . [ Laughs . ]
 DRIVER Your laugh is becoming more and more maniacal .
 So the sex in this play occurs offstage ——
 DRIVER Except this time .
 RUSSELL [ deadpan ] We are doing it onstage . Twice .
 DRIVER No . [ Laughing . ] It ’ s offstage .
 Still , there ’ s some kissing , and some hand under Anna ’ s robe . Are you working with an intimacy choreographer ?
 RUSSELL No , there ’ s nothing too crazytown . It ’ s pretty tame . I think we ’ ve both done a lot worse . There wa one Tuesday morning on “ The Americans , ” 7 a.m. , Staten Island , I show up and they were like , “ This is the threesome on the bed. ” I said to the sweet little assistant director , “ I need a beer in my hand in the next 15 minute or this is not going to happen . ”
 You have very different background . Keri , you ’ ve been working since you were 15 . Adam , you had formal training at one of the best conservatory in the country . Do you feel like you approach acting differently ?
 RUSSELL I ’ m sure . My stage career is so limited and this is a new crazy leap of faith . I wa not going to do it and Matthew wa like , “ Do it , do it . It ’ ll be fine. ” I wa like , will it ? Knowing Adam a little bit , his sensitivity , I thought , Oh , I could do this with him . Because it ’ s not my world , it ’ s a different style altogether , which is very daunting .
 DRIVER But it is your world .
 RUSSELL It ’ s not my experience . Right now , I ’ m losing about 15 pound of weight every day . Sweat and nerve .
 Why do theater at all ? Theater is very exposing . It doesn ’ t really pay . You don ’ t get to grow with character a you did on your television series .
 RUSSELL I don ’ t have an answer right now .
 DRIVER Good , I ’ ll vamp . In theater , it ’ s different every night . The audience are different . I mean , I came from a theater background where there ’ s always a new question to ask yourself . I got used to that . It wa hard to adjust to suddenly doing a TV show or a huge franchise . That ’ s why I can ’ t watch anything I do . I know the potential of not having a right answer , of not settling . In the theater you get to explore it again tomorrow . Whereas in film , that ’ s it . Your mistake , that ’ s it .
 You ’ ve recently ended prestige series , “ The Americans ” and “ Girls. ” Are you consciously trying to choose different project and different character ?
 RUSSELL I like what I like . Probably if something came across that wa like a 1980s spy I probably wouldn ’ t want to do it .
 DRIVER You try to work with the good filmmaker if you can , then just because they ’ re different people , the thing you work on are different . And you want to work with the best playwright . But I don ’ t sort of consciously think , O.K. , now I have to do a thing .
 Adam , you ’ re just back from the Oscars . Spike Lee finally ha a win . How did you ——
 DRIVER It wa a great moment . To be there to share that with him wa pretty special . Being there for that , watching him talking about it all afterward wa a pretty thrilling night .
 This isn ’ t your only collaboration this year . You also both appear in “ Star Wars : Episode IX. ” What can you tell me ? Did you have scene together ?
 DRIVER Don ’ t know . Don ’ t know if we did .
 RUSSELL Nothing nothing nothing .
 DRIVER I can ’ t say if we had any scene together .
 No climactic lightsaber battle then ?
 DRIVER Someone had a lightsaber .
 RUSSELL It wa pretty cool , that ’ s all I have to say .
 An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Matthew Rhys ’ s relationship to Keri Russell . He is her partner , not her husband .

 WASHINGTON — President Trump vowed on Thursday to reinvigorate and reinvent American missile defense in a speech that recalled Cold War-era vision of nuclear adversary — though he never once mentioned Russia or China , the two great-power threat to the United States .
 While the president infused the new missile effort with his ambition for a Space Force , the actual plan released by the Pentagon were far more incremental . As a political matter , Mr. Trump ’ s speech seemed designed to play well with his base , a tough-sounding call to a new generation of arm that evoked Ronald Reagan ’ s 1983 “ Star Wars ” missile defense program .
 But the timing wa awkward .
 The president ’ s enthusiastic endorsement of new technology to detect and intercept incoming missile stand in sharp contrast to his demand , for example , for a decidedly low-tech barrier — a wall — on the southwestern border to stop migrant from illegally entering the United States . And his call for billion of dollar in new spending on missile defense come a the government is shut down in a dispute over $ 5.7 billion for that wall .
 “ Our goal is simple : to ensure that we can detect and destroy any missile launched against the United States anywhere , any time , any place , ” Mr. Trump said .
 “ Our strategy is grounded in one overriding objective : to detect and destroy every type of missile attack against any American target , whether before or after launch , ” he said . “ When it come to defending America , we will not take any chance . We will only take action . There is no substitute for American military might . ”
 In fact , the Pentagon document is aimed largely at destroying small number of missile launched by regional power , rather than overwhelming strike from Russia or China .
 Mr. Trump also never talked about the threat from North Korea , where an expanding fleet of nuclear-capable missile ha been a focus of missile-defense advocate for year .
 On Friday , the president is expected to see North Korea ’ s former intelligence chief at the White House , part of an effort to set up a second summit meeting with Kim Jong-un , the country ’ s leader . Mr. Trump ’ s aide have privately expressed concern that a the United States improves it missile defense in Asia , the North could see that a a reason never to disarm .
 In his speech , Mr. Trump focused most of his specific warning on Iran — a country that doe not have nuclear capability or intercontinental ballistic missile , but continues to expand it regional capability . And he made it clear he wa willing to engage in a technological arm race .
 The upgrade amounted to new layer of space-based sensor to pick up the movement of mobile missile launch , and a growing focus on disabling missile before they are launched , rather than depending on intercepting them in space .
 There wa no plan to deploy space-based interceptor , a key element of the Reagan-era vision that remains technologically elusive 35 year after it wa announced .
 Mr. Trump ’ s trip to the Pentagon on Thursday wa the first since Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in protest after the president ’ s decision to withdraw troop from Syria , and with an unusually public rebuke of the administration ’ s undercutting of ally . Mr. Trump wa joined there by the acting secretary , Patrick M. Shanahan , a former Boeing executive .
 The strategy Mr. Trump announced wa required by Congress , and originally planned for release last year .
 But it ran into delay , some sparked by question of how ambitious to make the goal — and whether a vast upgrade of America ’ s limited missile defense wa worth the money when the Pentagon is already building up cyberforces , considering a trillion-dollar upgrade of it nuclear weapon delivery system and stretched thin around the world .
 The new document mark the first update to the policy since a 2010 review by the Obama administration . While that report focused more on the strategy and number of antimissile interceptor needed to deter North Korea and Iran , and where to base them , the Trump review put emphasis on attacking enemy missile “ prior to launch . ”
 The report envisions using layer of defense in a time of open conflict . But so far the primary effort to prevent the launch of missile have come a covert effort to disrupt North Korean flight test — an effort that wa accelerated in President Barack Obama ’ s last three year in office .
 “ If deterrence fails and conflict with a rogue state or within a region ensues , ” the document said , “ U.S . attack operation supporting missile defense will degrade , disrupt or destroy an adversary ’ s missile before they are launched . ”
 The strike , it said , will “ increase the effectiveness of active missile defense by reducing the number of adversary missile to be intercepted . ”
 The report suggests a series of innovation to bolster the nation ’ s active defense . They include improving the standard interceptor missile , known a SM-3 , so greatly that it could knock out the fast-moving warhead from intercontinental missile . Today , the SM-3 system is designed for shorter-range threat , which move relatively slowly .
 “ I think this is impossible , ” Joe Cirincione , the president of the Ploughshares Fund , told reporter in a telephone briefing organized by the Center for Arms Control and Nonproliferation . Both group back arm control . “ I don ’ t think that the technology exists now or will for decade to come . ”
 The new policy also stated that the Trump administration wa seeking to stop enemy missile before they got far off the ground — a step known a boost-phase interception , since the attack would happen while a missile ’ s engine were still firing . The approach ha gained support since North Korea started testing long-range missile .
 In the future , the report said , the nation ’ s F-35 fighter jet “ can be equipped with a new or modified interceptor capable of shooting down adversary ballistic missile in their boost phase , ” or moment after liftoff .
 In the most contentious proposal , the report embraced Reagan ’ s Star Wars plan of putting weapon in space to shoot down enemy missile during ascent . But again , the document wa careful to describe the step a largely a research project — at least for now .
 As directed by Congress , it said , the Defense Department “ will identify the most promising technology , and estimated schedule , cost and personnel requirement for a possible space-based defensive layer that achieves an early operational capability . ”
 When Mr. Trump alluded to a space-based element of American defense , he did not include those caveat .
 Representative Adam Smith of Washington , the new Democratic chairman of the House Armed Services Committee , said the idea of space-based weapon “ ha been studied repeatedly and found to be technologically challenging and prohibitively expensive . ”
 Even some defense hawk , like Senator Jack Reed , a Rhode Island Democrat and former Army Ranger , said after the speech that “ integrated , space-based capability are certainly worth exploring , but we don ’ t have unlimited resource , so we must weigh investment among competing national security priority . ’ ’
 Historically , that ha always been the problem with missile defense : The technology ha always seemed more promising on paper than in reality . And the Pentagon ha never kept up with Hollywood ’ s imagining .
 The gargantuan effort to shield the nation from missile strike is often said to start in 1983 with Reagan ’ s “ Star Wars ” program . Over the decade , the United States ha spent more than $ 300 billion on the antimissile goal , according to Stephen I. Schwartz , who study the cost of military project .
 The program ’ s expense is directly related to the difficulty of the physic . Warheads fired by intercontinental missile zip along at more than four mile a second . Success rate have been unimpressive .
 The nation ’ s antimissile corp relies on a relatively simple approach that us ground-based interceptor . They race skyward and release speeding projectile meant to destroy incoming warhead by force of impact — what expert call hitting a bullet with a bullet .
 The method ha demonstrated fair performance against short-range threat , which move relatively slowly . In 2004 , the Bush administration began deploying a bullet-on-bullet system in Alaska and California to defend against North Korean warhead .
 Since then , the system ha undergone 10 costly flight test against mock warhead . Five of the test failed . The most recent test , in May 2017 , successfully smashed the mock target to smithereens .
 Russia ha emerged a perhaps the greatest threat a it develops a range of next-generation missile system . In 2014 , Washington formally accused Moscow of breaching an arm treaty by developing and deploying a prohibited weapon .
 Although Russia ha consistently denied any violation , the Trump administration told Moscow in October that it is leaving the landmark treaty .

 ( Reuters ) - Netflix Inc gave a weak forecast on Tuesday that unnerved investor just a Walt Disney Co and others prepare to escalate Hollywood 's streaming video war , although the company 's quarterly result beat Wall Street target .
 Shares of Netflix traded down about 1 percent at $ 355.02 in after-the-bell trading .
 Netflix predicted it would pick up 5 million new streaming subscriber from April through June . That wa below the 5.48 million consensus of industry analyst surveyed by FactSet .
 `` What 's making investor nervous is that there are sign of a slowdown in the second-quarter subscriber growth , '' said Haris Anwar , senior analyst at Investing.com . `` This is made all the more prominent by the looming threat of competition from Disney and Apple . ''
 Netflix added a record number of paid streaming customer in the first quarter , reaching a total of 148.86 million .
 The just-ended first quarter included the debut of original drama `` Sex Education '' and `` Russian Doll , '' and the company raised price in the United States , Mexico and Brazil .
 In a letter to shareholder , Netflix said it saw `` some modest short-term churn effect , '' or dropping of it service , in response to the price increase .
 From January through March , Netflix reported it added 7.86 million paid subscriber internationally , compared with the average analyst estimate of 7.14 million , according to IBES data from Refinitiv .
 The company said it signed up 1.74 million paid subscriber in the United States in the quarter , above the average analyst estimate of about 1.57 million , according to IBES data from Refinitiv .
 Netflix is spending billion to attract new customer while Disney and Apple Inc build streaming rival and Amazon.com Inc make gain with audience .
 `` With a combined market cap of around $ 2.2 trillion , those three bruiser are n't to be messed with , '' Hargreaves Lansdown equity analyst George Salmon said .
 Disney is viewed a one of Netflix 's strongest rival thanks to a broad portfolio of franchise popular with child - from Mickey Mouse to Marvel and Star Wars - and a brand trusted by parent . Last week , Disney priced it service at $ 7 per month , just over half the $ 13 price for Netflix 's most U.S. popular plan . The Disney+ service will launch in November .
 `` We do n't anticipate that these new entrant will materially affect our growth , '' Netflix said , `` because the transition from linear to on-demand entertainment is so massive and because of the different nature of our content offering . `` Disney is leading a shift among traditional medium company that had been selling programming to Netflix for year . Now , many have decided to keep their content for their own service . AT & T Inc 's WarnerMedia and Comcast Corp plan to move into the streaming market .
 Netflix spent $ 7.5 billion on TV show and movie for 2018 , and executive have said that amount will grow in 2019 . The aggressive spending ha led to a tripling of the company 's debt in two year , to $ 10.36 billion in 2018 , from $ 3.36 billion in 2016 .
 For the first quarter , Netflix said it net income rose to $ 344.1 million , or 76 cent per share , from $ 290.1 million , or 64 cent per share , a year earlier . Analysts on average were expecting 57 cent per share .
 Total revenue rose to $ 4.52 billion from $ 3.70 billion . Analysts on average had expected revenue of $ 4.50 billion .
 Netflix share had closed up 3 percent in regular Nasdaq trading on Tuesday ahead of the result .

 When M. Night Shyamalan wa asked what the biggest plot twist in his own life wa , he paused and thought carefully .
 The answer , said Shyamalan , whose name ha been synonymous with twist since his 1999 breakthrough , “ The Sixth Sense , ” wa having come full circle : back to making film in his native Philadelphia , back to the kind of thriller that in 2002 led Newsweek to label him “ the Next Spielberg . ”
 “ All I want to do is make thriller , ” Shyamalan , 48 , said in a phone interview last week . After year spent making other kind of film , he added , coming back to what he loved most had prompted a realization : “ Wow , I had everything I wanted in the first place . ”
 It ’ s appropriate , then , that “ Glass , ” which debut this weekend , completes another kind of circle . Riding high on the success of it predecessor , “ Split ” ( 2017 ) , the film concludes an original superhero trilogy that began in 2000 with “ Unbreakable ” — a grim and deliberate origin story that arrived , perhaps , just a little too soon .
 Conventional wisdom then held that an original superhero story wouldn ’ t sell , and Shyamalan ha said that Disney , which produced “ Unbreakable , ” encouraged him not to market it a a comic-book movie — an unthinkable strategy today . ( A harbinger of the culture to come , “ X-Men , ” released that same year , grossed nearly 300 million . ) “ Unbreakable ” made money , but it fell way short of “ The Sixth Sense ” and failed to resonate the way Shyamalan had hoped .
 Still , his instinct were ultimately validated : Spandex went mainstream , and “ Unbreakable , ” always a critic ’ favorite , amassed a loyal fan base over the year , not least with the Comic Con set . Then Shyamalan surprised fan with “ Split ” : a horror-thriller sequel starring James McAvoy that took in over $ 278 million on a $ 9 million budget . After a string of critical failure including “ The Last Airbender , ” “ The Happening ” and “ After Earth , ” there wa talk of a comeback .
 That momentum also put pressure on “ Glass ” — which with it $ 20 million budget and long script , Shyamalan said , wa the toughest film he ever made . Calling from Europe , he talked about the film and offered insight on the “ Unbreakable ” universe , and on whether he would ever direct a “ Star Wars ” film . Following are edited excerpt from that conversation .
 When you made “ Unbreakable , ” the market for superhero movie wa nothing like it is today . What do you make of Hollywood ’ s being so welcoming of them now ?
 It make sense . I wa happy to be in front of that and say , “ Hey , let ’ s make a comic book movie , a movie about comic books. ” And everyone going : “ That ’ s a very fringe market . That ’ s not a mainstream notion , and regular people don ’ t go to see those kind of movies. ” And now , it ’ s ubiquitous .
 I understand it . It ’ s a mythology that ’ s self-empowering . It ’ s god among u . It ’ s story of regular people turning into god , essentially , in a modern vernacular .
 You were born in India , brought up Hindu , but attended Catholic school . What is your level of spirituality today , and ha it changed since “ The Sixth Sense ” ?
 It ’ s become more clarified in my mind . I think I would define myself a more of a believer in thing now in the sense that , post- “ Sixth Sense , ” I have always been a believer in something . I just couldn ’ t put a more accurate label on it .
 You ’ ve been agnostic .
 Yeah , I ’ m not religious at all . I have my issue with the specificity of organized religion and the tribalism that that conjures , but I am somebody who really belief in whatever you want to call it , the universe and our place in it .
 [ Check out The Times ’ s Culture Calendar here . ]
 When you ’ re around your family and friend , are you the comedian in the room ?
 Yeah , I ’ m the goofball in the room for sure . The place that I ’ m dead serious is when we talk about cinema . That ’ s the place I ’ m not a whole lot of fun to be around . If you ’ re going to watch a [ bad ] television show , you don ’ t want to watch that with me . You ’ re going to have a miserable time because I ’ ll be wincing and I ’ ll be commenting . For me , it ’ s an art form . Cinema need to be honored . Those ingredient need to be thought of in a sacred way .
 Some of the narrative surrounding “ The Visit ” and “ Split ” characterized them a “ comeback ” for you . Was that frustrating ?
 No , the journey isn ’ t really about what others are saying about you . It just can ’ t be . You ’ re taking all of your power away from you . That ’ s not where your energy should be . Your energy should be in the thing that you have control over . And a a writer , you have control over a ton .
 After “ Unbreakable ” came out , you talked about how it didn ’ t connect with audience the way you thought it would . Do you think it would connect better today ?
 I do think it would do really well today . It would ’ ve done even better when we first released it if we had really embraced that it wa a comic-book movie .
 “ Unbreakable ” and “ Split ” had drastically different tone . One wa a comic book movie and the other more a horror film . How did you merge the two for “ Glass ” ?
 Think of it this way : The tone of “ Unbreakable ” match it main character , David Dunn [ Bruce Willis ] , who ha a kind of somber , introspective , slow-build realization . And then the main character of “ Split ” is the kinetic , pyrotechnic character that ’ s violent , scary , funny and weird — and threatening . That film ha a very dark thriller , almost horror , vibe . And so it match it main character .
 And “ Glass ” represents it titular character , Mr. Glass [ Samuel L. Jackson ] . He is very philosophical and playing a chess match , and he ha a little tongue-in-cheek smile . So each movie hopefully represents it main character .
 Looking at James McAvoy ’ s character in “ Split ” and “ Glass , ” he kidnaps teenager and occasionally eats them . Especially in “ Split , ” some of the scene are quite gruesome . What kind of head space do you have to be in to create that ?
 I ’ ve been in more of a mood of doing more shocking thing and juxtaposing that against the emotion or the humor of a sequence . It ’ s funny because I feel that the tone I wa interested in , when I wa thinking about doing the trilogy , are more appropriate in the movie theater now than they were in 1999 .
 I ’ m a big supporter of my character . I really am devoted to them . They may do something horrific — but overall , I ’ m a supporter and very empathetic to where they ’ re coming from and why they have this behavior and where the trauma came from . As you ’ re watching “ Glass , ” you ’ re incredibly sympathetic to all of them , a you see the story come to it conclusion .
 After “ Split , ” there wa criticism of McAvoy ’ s character from mental health professional , saying that the portrayal stigmatized people with dissociative identity disorder . Was that fair ?
 That wa a very minor thing . In fact , this would be the biggest mention of it in it history . It wa like 1 percent of 1 percent of people even had that [ criticism ] . And there wa a huge positive reaction to it . Obviously , when you see “ Glass , ” you will see the incredibly positive portrayal of the character and the core character and the thing that they suffer from .
 When you were making “ Split , ” did you have an idea of how you wanted “ Glass ” to end ?
 I did . I had a couple idea about where the literal stitch line could be . So , I wa toying with those , but really between the time when I finished “ Split ” and when it came out , which wa about four month , it wa in that period that I wa writing “ Glass , ” and I wa really homing in on the exact specific .
 When “ Unbreakable ” came out , you said , “ I had more control this time , but not the fun. ” Did you have more fun making “ Glass ” ?
 No , I don ’ t have a ton of fun making my movie . I ’ m super stressed out the whole time .
 You have joked in the past about directing a “ Star Wars ” film , so let ’ s get serious . Would you like to direct a “ Star Wars ” film ?
 Oh , my goodness . I think it ’ s probably best if I , for the most part , just consider making original movie — trying primarily to maintain the cinematic accent that is most comfortable for me . There are filmmaker who don ’ t fit easily into a system , and probably I ’ m one of those . This sense of losing your accent is you lose who you are .
 So I think probably that ’ s the best way to think about it for right now . But you can never say no about the future .

 One audience reviewer deemed the movie “ a complete disaster. ” Another wa “ tired of all this SJW nonsense , ” using the abbreviation for “ social justice warrior , ” a pejorative term for progressive . Yet another groused that Brie Larson , the movie ’ s star , “ say I shouldn ’ t see the movie anyway . ”
 “ Captain Marvel ” had not even been released yet — it opening day wa a month away — but that did not stop negative remark from piling up against the film and Ms. Larson .
 Much a Facebook and Twitter have had to grapple with false story aimed at inciting violence or disrupting election , movie review aggregator like Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb are often besieged by user trying to manipulate a film ’ s box office success .
 Despite the troll ’ concerted effort , “ Captain Marvel ” slayed during it opening weekend , but not before Rotten Tomatoes , an influential site where a bad audience score can damage a film ’ s prospect , made major change to it rule . Most critically , it eliminated prerelease audience review . It also stopped displaying the percentage of moviegoer who say they “ want to see ” a film in favor of using the raw number of people . And it removed the “ not interested ” button .
 “ We ’ re doing it to more accurately and authentically represent the voice of fan , ” the site said , “ while protecting our data and public forum from bad actor . ”
 The backlash against “ Captain Marvel ” resulted from a collision of two major force . One wa the popularity of website that at their best democratize the reviewing of movie , restaurant and business and at their worst can be weaponized for score-settling or political grudge .
 The other wa the growing movement in Hollywood toward broader gender and racial representation in film role , production job and the industry in general .
 “ Captain Marvel ” is among the few superhero film to star a woman , but a bigger trigger factor for the film ’ s hater appeared to be Ms. Larson ’ s outspokenness about the lack of diversity in movie and news medium coverage of film .
 Before the film ’ s release , Ms. Larson told “ Entertainment Tonight ” that she had spoken with Marvel about making the film “ a big feminist movie. ” In another interview , she said that after noticing that most of her interviewer in the past had been white and male , she vowed to seek out more underrepresented journalist , including Keah Brown , who is black and disabled , and who profiled her for Marie Claire .
 Ms. Larson , who won the best-actress Oscar in 2016 for her performance in “ Room , ” had previously lashed out against the homogeneity of professional film critic . “ I do not need a 40-year-old white dude to tell me what didn ’ t work for him about ‘ A Wrinkle in Time , ’ ” she said during a speech last summer . “ It wasn ’ t made for him . ”
 This all provided fodder to troll , and week ahead of “ Captain Marvel ’ s ” release , the percentage of Rotten Tomatoes user who registered that they wanted to see it plummeted to 27 percent . On Feb. 25 , Rotten Tomatoes implemented the change , and the “ want to see ” score disappeared . Since the film ’ s nationwide release on Friday , the audience score ha rebounded to a better-but-still-not-great 63 percent , the lowest for any movie in the Marvel franchise . For a while , the score had been below 60 percent , signified by a tipped-over bucket of popcorn , the symbol for a film that might be one to skip .
 The “ Tomatometer , ” which analyzes the rating from film critic , is at a “ certified fresh ” 79 percent , slightly below the average for Marvel movie . It is impossible to say whether the website ’ s change helped the film , but it made $ 456 million during it opening weekend , trouncing projection .
 A representative for Ms. Larson declined to comment , and publicist at Disney , which owns Marvel Studios , did not reply to email Tuesday .
 The film ’ s opponent also swarmed YouTube ; video rant with title like “ Brie Larson is Ruining Marvel ” often appeared at the top of search for her name . But a day before the film ’ s release , a change in the search result pushed those video beneath others from established source like Jimmy Kimmel , “ Today ” and Wired .
 A YouTube representative said the reason wa an algorithm change made last summer that reclassifies trending search topic a news . The site , which is owned by Google , took the action a part of it effort to combat fictitious content and ensure that reliable information wa highlighted .
 “ Captain Marvel ” detractor also flocked to IMDb , though a representative from that site said no one wa available to comment , and would only provide a link to the site ’ s rating and comment policy , which state that user are not allowed to rate a film before it release .
 The new Marvel movie is not the first film to come under attack for a perceived feminist or politically correct underpinning . The all-female remake of “ Ghostbusters , ” “ Black Panther ” and “ Star Wars : The Last Jedi , ” which had a diverse cast , all found themselves in the cross hair of armchair critic , some aligned with alt-right group .
 Some site pushed back . Last year , Rotten Tomatoes said it would delete comment posted from member of the Facebook group “ Down with Disney ’ s Treatment of Franchises and Its Fanboys ” if they contained hate speech . The group had posted an event called “ Give Black Panther a Rotten Audience Score on Rotten Tomatoes. ” Facebook then deactivated the group ( it ha since been revived by someone claiming to be anti-troll ) , which had also claimed responsibility for torpedoing audience score for “ Star Wars : The Last Jedi . ”
 That a movie starring Ms. Larson spurred Rotten Tomatoes into taking a bolder step wa no coincidence .
 When Ms. Larson spoke out last summer against the dominance of white male critic , she cited finding by the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative , which is run out of the University of Southern California and had singled out Rotten Tomatoes for having 3.5 men to every female critic reviewing the top film of 2017 .
 In her speech , Ms. Larson also revealed that the Sundance and Toronto film festival had each pledged to set aside one-fifth of their press pass for use by diverse journalist , including woman and people of color .
 Two and a half month later , Rotten Tomatoes threw in with Ms. Larson ’ s cause , and revamped it criterion for critic , focusing more on individual qualification than the brand and reach of a publication , to include hundred of reviewer from underrepresented group in it Tomatometer score ( a representative said the change had been in development for over a year ) . It also pledged $ 100,000 to various film festival working to diversify their press corp , in part by helping cover freelancer ’ travel and lodging cost .
 A representative for Rotten Tomatoes , Dana Benson , said the change to it audience score had been in the work for a while , but that the attack on “ Captain Marvel ” prompted them to roll it out earlier than planned .
 “ We ’ re very dedicated to making criticism more inclusive , ” Ms. Benson said . “ All the thought and care that went into the Tomatometer , we are expanding that to the audience score . ”
 Rotten Tomatoes said future change could include having “ verified ” reviewer , like the one who post on Amazon after purchasing a product . Those could come from people who bought ticket through Fandango , the movie ticket website , which owns Rotten Tomatoes .
 There wa , not unexpectedly , a flip side to the attack on “ Captain Marvel ” — people rushing to it defense , whether they had seen the movie or not .
 “ There are a large group of people that are only down-voting this movie because they somehow feel threatened by it , ” wrote one fan on Rotten Tomatoes .
 “ Imagine being so insecure , you cry about a movie with a girl a the hero , ” wrote another .
 And over on IMDb , one wrote : “ I do agree that this isn ’ t marvel ’ s best movie , but it wa a fun and enjoyable ride . I ’ m sure director and co. were hyper aware of the backlash they were facing and some of the moment seemed like tongue-in-cheek middle finger to all the hate . ”

 In 2011 , the British writer-comedian Joe Cornish delivered a promising feature directing debut with “ Attack the Block , ” a wild , irreverent science-fiction action-comedy about an alien invasion thwarted by a gang of tough teenager . That film , which also gave u the screen acting debut of the future “ Star Wars ” favorite John Boyega , wa not a huge hit , but gained cult status over the year , prompting speculation about what it talented writer-director might do next .
 It ’ s taken eight year for Cornish to release another feature , and it may feel strange at first to see him at the helm of a modest child ’ s adventure about a modern-day King Arthur . But “ The Kid Who Would be King ” still ha some of the wit and sweep that distinguished Cornish ’ s earlier work .
 The film ’ s setup is simple . The meek 12-year-old Alex ( Louis Ashbourne Serkis ) , chased into an abandoned construction site by the school bully , come upon a sword stuck in a hunk of stone and pull it out . A Latin inscription on the weapon suggests that it may well be Excalibur , the legendary sword of King Arthur , although Jack and his best pal , Bedders ( Dean Chaumoo ) , initially decide that ’ s a ridiculous notion .
 Circumstances soon change . Flaming demon appear in the middle of the night and torment our bewildered hero . Out of the mist of Stonehenge emerges the rather odd-mannered young wizard Merlin ( Angus Imrie ) , who enrolls himself at school under the name of Mertin . ( “ Greetings , fellow academician , ” he intones to the other kid . “ I am a perfectly normal contemporary English schoolboy ! ” )
 He then try to convince Alex and Bedders that the world need their heroism at this very moment , for a variety of reason . For starter , the country seems divided , and political and social discord rule the land — a bit of real-life relevance the film doesn ’ t pursue much further . More urgently ( and cinematically ) , Arthur ’ s mortal enemy Morgana ( Rebecca Ferguson ) is emerging from a centuries-long slumber , intent on enslaving humanity .
 What ensues is a brisk , well-mounted child ’ s fantasy , with Cornish giving the story an entertainingly apocalyptic spin . Children covered in armor drive “ Mad Max ” -style car to combat the force of darkness , while their school turn into a hellscape of warfare and fire . The action is creatively staged , without ever getting too intense or scary for young viewer . And the script balance humor , pathos and wish fulfillment a it portrays Alex ’ s rise from mopey dreamer to confident warrior , without overdoing the mythic portent .

 The Pentagon said that a test on Monday of a new tactic for intercepting missile aimed at American city wa a success , in an exercise that appeared intended to simulate how the United States would defend against an adversary like North Korea .
 The test , the first in nearly two year , wa conducted over the Pacific Ocean . It fired two “ interceptor ” from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California against a mock warhead launched from Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands .
 “ The system worked exactly a it wa designed to do , ” Air Force Lt. Gen. Samuel A. Greaves , director of the Pentagon ’ s Missile Defense Agency , said in a statement . “ This test demonstrates that we have a capable , credible deterrent against a very real threat . ”
 Evaluating the success of missile interception is difficult . In the past , the Missile Defense Agency ha been accused of exaggerating it “ kill ” in order to quiet critic who say a 50 percent successful interception rate is far from satisfactory .
 The new system wa intended to boost the success rate by launching multiple interceptor — one to hit the target or knock it off it trajectory , and the next a a backup — at a single warhead . In Monday ’ s test , the Pentagon said the incoming warhead wa destroyed by the first interceptor , and that the second went after the largest remnant .
 The number of interceptor that can be fired at a single warhead is classified , but official have been quoted a saying that they ultimately hope to direct three or four at each incoming warhead .
 The massive , long-running effort to shield the nation from missile strike started in 1983 with President Ronald Reagan ’ s “ Star Wars ” program . Over the decade , the United States ha spent more than $ 300 billion on the antimissile goal , according to a tally conducted by Stephen I. Schwartz , an independent consultant who study the cost of military project .
 The program is expensive because the problem is so difficult . Warheads fired by intercontinental missile travel faster than four mile a second .
 Overall , the rate of success for attempted interception ha been so unimpressive that President Barack Obama stepped up a program called “ left of launch , ’ ’ designed to sabotage missile before they are launched . The secret program wa used against North Korea in Mr. Obama ’ s second term .
 The more public program is based on ground-based interceptor . They race skyward and release speeding projectile meant to destroy incoming warhead by force of impact — what expert call hitting a bullet with a bullet .
 After exiting a treaty with Russia that banned antimissile system , the administration of President George W. Bush began deploying a bullet-on-bullet system in Alaska and California , largely to defend against North Korean warhead .
 Since then , the system ha undergone 10 costly flight test against mock warhead . Five of the test failed . The most recent test , in May 2017 , successfully smashed the mock target , and wa declared a success .
 The Monday statement said the lead interceptor “ destroyed the re-entry vehicle , a it wa designed to do. ” The trailing interceptor , it added , then looked at the debris and remaining object . Not finding any other mock warhead , it selected the next “ most lethal object ” in the debris it could identify , the statement said , and struck that .
 The test wa not announced beforehand and the statement on the outcome wa released late in the day , which seemed to suggest that the test had encountered problem . The statement also introduced a note of hesitancy .
 “ Initial indication show the test met requirement , ” it said . “ Program official will continue to evaluate system performance based upon telemetry and other data obtained during the test . ”
 The mock target at Kwajalein , not far from where the United States once conduced nuclear test , wa launched more than 4,000 mile from the California coast . The interceptor were on the same base where the United States keep a part of it antiballistic missile fleet .

The puzzle wa originally submitted with SOFT SERVE and THE BIG DIG replacing LIP SERVICE and VOLLEYBALL . Will and Sam were rightfully concerned that an early-week theme would be lost on some solver without a revealer .
 If anyone ’ s ever looked at the team name in a volleyball league , you know the sport lends itself to punning ( shout out to my teammate on “ That ’ s What She Set ” ) . I wanted badly to come up with a groan-worthy revealer in that tradition . Alas no great idea were forthcoming , so I went with the direct approach and resubmitted a is .
 Thanks to the editing team for their guidance and for working the clue into Tuesday shape . Thanks also for leaving intact mention of my favorite book and TV show ( “ Catch-22 ” and “ The Wire ” ) .

 WOODMERE , N.Y. — If there is a world in which theater kid rule , Andrew Barth Feldman seems to live there .
 He wanders through the hall of his high school — a lank , 5-foot-6 , Disney-obsessed 16-year-old prone to bursting into song — like the mayor . Photos of him dot the hallway . Teachers stop mid-lesson when they spot him in the hallway , hoping he ’ ll come in and say hello to their class . A basketball star in the cafeteria smile and wave . The little kid in the library gawk a they hurtle by .
 He ’ s long been a standout in their world — the kid who wa organizing flash mob at fourth-grade assembly , who founded his own theater company at 12 ( it ’ s still going ) , who ha been acting in school play and camp show and community theater production for a long a anyone can remember .
 And now he ’ s going to Broadway .
 Even in an industry that delight in discovery , this teenager ’ s right-place-right-time story is one for the book : Last June , he wa competing in the National High School Musical Theater Awards ( known a the Jimmys ) — which he won — when the lead producer of “ Dear Evan Hansen ” happened to be in the audience .
 She knew immediately she wanted him for the show , and on Jan. 30 , he assumes the title role , playing Broadway ’ s favorite socially anxious and ethically confused adolescent .
 “ I ’ m so nervous all the time about it , ” he said , cleareyed , candid , and strikingly courteous a we talked in an empty classroom . “ If I were to make my Broadway debut in any role , it ’ s Evan , ” he added , somehow managing to be confident and self-doubting at the same time . “ This is my favorite show since I saw it , and everyone ha always said I ’ m right for the role . I think I agree . ”
 The role is wrenching , vocally and emotionally , and Andrew will be the first teenager to tackle it on Broadway . The character is 17 , but adolescent boy are often thought to be too immature to play adolescent boy , and all of his predecessor have been in their 20 ; Ben Platt , who won a Tony Award originating the role , wa 23 when the show opened .
 “ There ’ s the possibility of getting u something that ’ s authentic and original and vital and ha never been seen , ” said the show ’ s director , Michael Greif .
 Andrew is so young — and so new to the rigor of Broadway — that he ’ s going to begin his run doing just five performance a week , while taking vocal lesson to shore up his stamen . This will be his first professional production , and the creative team , determined to protect him a well a their smash-hit show , ha decided the reduced schedule is their way of investing in his long-term success ; the show ’ s alternate , Michael Lee Brown , will do the other three performance a Andrew build comfort and strength .
 “ It ’ s a little scary for all of u — for him , for me , for his mom — because we ’ re asking a lot of him , ” said Stacey Mindich , the show ’ s lead producer . “ But in every single moment he ha grown with u already — at every passage he ha shown u he is uber-capable . ”
 This is not one of those story about someone who happened into theater unwittingly . This is a story about an unabashed theater geek — a child who ha adored Broadway since he saw “ Beauty and the Beast ” at age 3 , who ha been happily singing on stage since he landed the role of Mr. Bundles in a community theater production of “ Annie ” at age 8 ; who writes song and play the piano , guitar , drum , ukulele and bass ; who ha been to all four edition of BroadwayCon , including the one last year where he won a lip-syncing competition while performing a Angelica Schuyler from “ Hamilton . ”
 His passion for the imaginary go way beyond musical . He ’ s a huge fan of “ Star Wars ” — “ We watched ‘ A New Hope ’ in English class to learn about archetype , and I wa like , ‘ Oh my God , this is the coolest thing ’ ” — and ha dressed a General Grievous and Kylo Ren for Halloween . ( It ’ s not that he ’ s drawn to the dark side ; it ’ s just , he say , that those character look cooler . )
 He ’ s an even huger fan of Disney ( which now owns “ Star Wars , ” so maybe that ’ s redundant ) . He estimate that he ’ s been to Disney theme park , including Disneyworld , Disneyland and Disneyland Paris , at least 20 time , starting when he wa 6 month old . “ Something draw me to the idea of being able to live in another world , ” he said .
 And now he really , really love “ Dear Evan Hansen. ” The first time he saw the musical , a couple of week after it opened on Broadway in 2016 , he wa so overcome he couldn ’ t find the word to talk about it when his mother came to pick him up .
 “ It really , really hit hard , ” he said . “ I had never had such a visceral reaction to anything . Ever . ”
 He started playing the cast album on repeat . He sent song to friend . He saw it again . And again .
 He relates to Evan , and not just because he , like the character , life with his single mom . “ I mean , I ’ m a teenager , ” he said . “ I ’ ve been lucky to never personally struggle with a diagnosis of anxiety or anything , but I am a teenager . Of course I feel anxiety . Of course I feel nervous . Of course I feel alone . ”
 He called Evan “ a manifestation of what ’ s going on in our head a teenager — he just can ’ t control what ’ s going on the outside a much a most of u can. ” And he asserted , with the confidence of a teenager who ha been seeing a many Broadway show a he could for a long a he can remember , “ there ha never been a character so thoroughly real and authentic to that experience . ”
 I asked Andrew to show me around his high school — Lawrence Woodmere Academy , a small private school in the Five Towns section of Long Island — since he ’ ll be portraying a high school senior on Broadway while still a high school junior himself .
 Of course , a of a few week ago , he ’ s not actually showing up for class — Broadway is too time-consuming , so instead he ’ s being tutored for 15 hour a week .
 He grew up nearby , first in Hewlett Neck , and then in Woodmere . His mother is an alumna and administrator at the school ; his father , a lawyer , life in Manhattan , and he ha an older sister . His tight-knit family also includes his mother ’ s sister , who life down the street ; the sister raised their child together , and Andrew regard his cousin a his brother .
 Andrew ha been performing nonstop since “ Annie. ” He had tried a variety of sport , but didn ’ t like them ; he wa better at teaching his fellow 9- and 10-year-olds to sing Beatles tune . And then his parent ’ marriage wa splitting up , and his ailing grandparent had moved into his house , so his mother , Barbra Feldman , wa thrilled that he had found something he could do in a place that felt healthier than home at the time . She ha spent the year since supporting his enthusiasm . “ My plan wa not for my son to be a Broadway star , ” she said . “ My plan wa to have a happy , well-adjusted child . ”
 He ha played an amazing array of role — the donkey in “ Shrek , ” Danny in “ Grease , ” Jack in “ Into the Woods ” — because over the last few year , he ha often been doing five show at a time , performing not only at school but also at Plaza Theatrical Productions in Lynbrook , the Rockaway Theater Company and St. Gregory ’ s Theater Group in Queens and Broadway Workshop in Manhattan . He ha also built a large group of friend from the theater world ; he met his girlfriend , who life in Maryland , at Broadway Workshop .
 “ He ’ s the nicest child I ’ ve ever worked with , ” said Marc Tumminelli , the director of Broadway Workshop . “ And by being in amazing show , a well a show that weren ’ t that great , he built his own process , so he ’ s ready . ”
 The composer of “ Be More Chill , ” Joe Iconis , said he met Andrew in 2017 , when the teenager wa performing a Roger in a youth theater production of “ Rent ” that Mr. Iconis ’ s brother wa directing . “ It wa truly insane watching that kid sing ‘ One Song Glory ’ a well a I ’ ve ever heard it sung ever , ” he said . “ He ’ s some sort of insane musical theater creature who ha a preternatural ability to perform . ”
 The theater company Andrew founded — called Zneefrock after the name Andrew made up for the alien at the now-closed space-themed restaurant Mars 2112 — began a his bar mitzvah project . He wanted to hold a one-night cabaret to raise money for autism research , because one of his cousin is on the autism spectrum .
 That evening of “ Les Misérables ” and “ Wicked ” medley held at the school theater wa so successful , drawing theater kid , their family and fan that it became an annual event , with each one more ambitious , and raising more money for charity , than the one before . There wa the “ Star Wars ” parody musical , which Andrew wrote with a friend ; a minimalist reimagining of “ Seussical ” ; and , last summer , a production of “ Be More Chill ” ( yes , they managed to stage the show before it arrives on Broadway this winter ) .
 And then , most impressively , last fall Zneefrock staged Jason Robert Brown ’ s “ The Last Five Years , ” which is a beloved two-hander about the rise and fall of an unsuccessful marriage , with a different gender configuration at each performance — boy-girl , girl-boy , boy-boy and girl-girl — to see how the show ’ s complex romantic dynamic might shift .
 Now Andrew ’ s life is all Evan .
 He said his house suddenly look a if it wa decorated by Ms. Mindich because there is so much stuff bearing the show ’ s signature color . “ It ’ s like , everything is blue now , ” he said .
 He ha vowed to stop eating dairy ( hard when chocolate milk is still a dietary staple ) , and started drinking a lot of tea ( plus water , water , and water ) . He ’ s rehearsing up to five hour a day , six day a week . And he ’ s thinking about Evan .
 “ Who is this person , separated from the performance that I ’ ve seen ? ” he asks himself a he delf deeper and deeper into the role . “ I learn a bunch of new thing about him every day , every rehearsal , every time I sit down and look at the script . And I ’ m going to find him . ”
 An earlier version of this article misstated Evan Hansen ’ s year in high school . The character is a senior , not a junior .

 There ’ s more to the show than banging on a can . Ask George Lucas , Hillary Clinton — and the performer who ’ s been doing it for 20 year .
 By Sopan Deb
 One man ’ s trash really can be another man ’ s treasure . At least that ’ s the lesson you might take from “ Stomp , ” the durable New York-based stage show that ha become a long-running institution in a city where sticking power can be hard to come by .
 About to celebrate the 25th anniversary of it New York premiere , “ Stomp ” ha endured , not thanks to high-priced set and effect , but from wielding everyday object like broom , garbage can and wooden pole to create a wordless percussive explosion onstage . And let ’ s not forget the 150 or so performer who have smacked their way in and out of it cast . ( On March 3 , some alumnus will join the current cast in the two performance , followed by a private party . )
 “ Stomp ” is the brainchild of Luke Cresswell , 55 , and Steve McNicholas , 63 , who still maintain creative control . ( Blue Man Group , another downtown mainstay , wa sold to Cirque du Soleil in 2017 . ) And while they have expressed interest in branching out — in 1997 , Mr. McNicholas told the Times , “ We ’ re kind of trapped , because we don ’ t feel we can walk away from it ” — “ Stomp ” ha come to define their life .
 They started working together in the early 1980s , creating a one-off in their hometown Brighton , England , called “ Romance Is Not Dead ” that they performed on the day of the royal wedding of Charles and Diana a counterprogramming .
 Later , they busked on the street outside the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in a band called Pookiesnackenburger . Mr. Cresswell described their early music in an interview a “ very eclectic , punky , thrashy , scratchy , ” and with “ lot of running around . ”
 The band eventually split up , but Mr. Cresswell and Mr. McNicholas formed a new troupe : an ensemble of eight performer that made it debut a “ Stomp ” at the festival in 1991 .
 Mr. Cresswell had been the band ’ s percussionist ; since he could only carry a few small drum , he began improvising on the street , which meant he would use surrounding object a well . “ We quickly learned how much the audience enjoyed that kind of experimentation , ” Mr. McNicholas said .
 After three year of international touring , Mr. Cresswell and Mr. McNicholas brought the act to New York where it ha never left the Orpheum Theater in the East Village . Along the way , “ Stomp ” launched several touring company , appeared on late night television , filmed an HBO special and collaborated with A-listers .
 There have been bump . In 2010 , a national tour of “ Pandemonium : The Lost and Found Orchestra , ” another sound-centered show from Mr. Cresswell and Mr. McNicholas , wa canceled after le than three week of performance .
 But “ Stomp ” itself ha become part of pop culture and an unqualified success , which hasn ’ t fazed the founding duo . “ We ’ re British and we live in England so we ’ re quite reserved , ” said Mr. McNicholas . “ We ’ re quite used to people telling u that we ’ re nothing special . ”
 As the show celebrates a quarter century in New York , where a spokeswoman said it ha grossed about $ 100 million , here are 10 thing you might not know about “ Stomp . ”
 In the early 1980s , Pookiesnackenburger wa a supporting act for Madness at the Dominion Theater in London . Yes , that Madness , a in the guy who earwormed “ Our house in the middle of the street ” into an entire generation of unsuspecting British teenager .
 “ They once described u a their favorite group , ” Mr. McNicholas said .
 The connection ha lasted . Mr. Cresswell and Mr. McNicholas helped orchestrate a theatrical launch show for Madness ’ s 2009 album , “ The Liberty of Norton Folgate . ”
 “ Stomp ” prop might seem widely available . But Mr. Cresswell said that everyday object , depending on where they ’ re made , make different sound . He and Mr. McNicholas have the prop shipped from Britain by boat .
 On one voyage in the late 1990s , a freak wave hit a boat carrying “ Stomp ” trash can . The cargo box carrying the can sank to the bottom of the North Sea .
 “ Stomp ” ha used a total of 13,000 pole , 5,200 box of tissue , and 52,000 candle during it New York run .
 And for when the drummer have suffered injury : 7,800 Ace bandage .
 In the late 1990s , George Lucas wa looking to cast “ Star Wars : Episode I — The Phantom Menace , ” the highly anticipated prequel to the franchise . He had seen “ Stomp ” on the West Coast .
 “ They were looking for someone really musical and with rhythm , ” Mr. Cresswell recalled .
 Mr. Lucas and the casting director , Robin Gurland , invited several “ Stomp ” cast member to audition . Ahmed Best got the job — a Jar Jar Binks , who ended up being one of the most reviled character in “ Star Wars ” history .
 In the original 1994 review , the critic Stephen Holden wrote : “ One person who would probably have given ‘ Stomp ’ his stamp of approval is John Cage . Not only doe the show demonstrate with an entrancing charm the music to be found in everyday object , it doe so at a relatively modest volume . ”
 Cage , who died two year before “ Stomp ” debuted in New York , wa the influential avant-garde composer who thrived on defying convention , and urged other artist to do the same .
 The “ Stomp ” creator have had plenty of celebrity collaborator , from Bette Midler ( the root of the show are clear in a pre- “ Stomp ” segment from her “ Mondo Beyondo Show ” ) to the vaudevillian Bill Irwin ( on “ The Late Show With David Letterman ” in 1997 ) .
 The founder ’ favorite appearance , they said , wa with Paul Simon and Jimmy Fallon , performing the Simon and Garfunkel hit “ Cecilia ” on “ Late Night With Jimmy Fallon ” in 2011 .
 Carlos Thomas , 42 , is one of the longest running cast member , having made his debut 20 year ago .
 He wa more prepared for his audition than most prospective performer , having grown up with a single mother who couldn ’ t afford to buy him instrument .
 “ To practice rhythm , I would make drum out of pot and pan , ” Mr. Thomas said in an interview . “ In high school , I would be the guy who would take the desk , chair and chalk on the chalkboard and go ‘ Chooka-chooka-chooka. ’ I ’ d make music out of everything in the classroom . ”
 In 2015 , Daniela and Tom Isenschmid bought out an entire “ Stomp ” show in London so they could make the performance the main attraction at their wedding reception .
 “ Stomp ” audition occur once every two or three year . They are essentially open call .
 One time , a dancer brought her boyfriend to an audition in London . The boyfriend watched the workshop through a window .
 “ We said , ‘ Come in , come in. ’ And he came in , and he wa great , ” Mr. Cresswell said .
 His girlfriend didn ’ t make the ensemble . Paul Bend did , and ha been a “ Stomp ” cast member since 2001 . The couple is no longer together .
 In 1999 , Mr. Cresswell and Mr. McNicholas were planning to mark the millennium scuba diving off the Micronesian island Yap , until they received a call from the office of Hillary Clinton , who wa first lady at the time . Mrs. Clinton requested that they perform on the step of the Lincoln Memorial on New Year ’ s Eve . ( Quincy Jones , a longtime supporter of the partner , helped make the connection . )
 “ Stomp ” dutifully did the show and skipped the scuba diving .
 “ Then we partied at the White House till 4 in the morning , ” Mr. Cresswell said . “ It wa fantastic . ”
 “ It wa the best party I ’ ve ever been to , ” Mr. McNicholas added .

 If you sat through Sunday ’ s football-related entertainment , you could be forgiven for swearing off Super Bowls forever .
 That might be too precipitous . Quite a few recent game have been thriller with lot of touchdown and exciting moment .
 Just last year the Philadelphia Eagles won their first championship in half a century in a 74-point classic . The year before the New England Patriots and Atlanta Falcons battled into overtime . In the last 10 year , we have had Patriots 28-Seattle Seahawks 24 , Baltimore Ravens 34-San Francisco 49ers 31 and Giants 21-Patriots 17 .
 Sunday wa more of a throwback to the late 1980s and early ’ 90 , when the Denver Broncos or the Buffalo Bills were getting demolished year after year and Super Bowls let the public down a frequently a Star Wars prequels .
 And come on now . Was Sunday ’ s game even really all that bad ?
 Yes . Yes it wa .
 But with the help of a time machine , or something , maybe we can tweak the past just a little and make Sunday ’ s game just a little more like the recent squeaker .
 Close your eye and imagine :
 The New Orleans Saints brought the N.F.L . title to Bourbon Street with a 49-41 victory over the New England Patriots destined to be a modern classic .
 Drew Brees led New Orleans ’ s high-powered offense , which scored 40 or more point six time this season , to one of it most potent result , throwing for six touchdown .
 The Saints had found their way into the Super Bowl after Los Angeles Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman wa called for eight different penalty after his helmet-to-helmet hit on Tommylee Lewis in the N.F.C . championship game . The Saints scored on the next play , giving the Rams too far to come back .
 Brees showed veteran poise on Sunday by repeatedly finding Lewis and Michael Thomas . “ When you ’ re a young quarterback who ha never been to the big game before , you will make mistake against a great defense , ” Brees said . “ Thankfully no one like that faced the Patriots today . ”
 At 41 , Tom Brady defied his year with an aerial show of his own that fell just short , taking advantage of a Saints defense that almost seemed to want him to score , just to get the ball back in Brees ’ s hand .
 Only special team fan were disappointed , a neither team ever sent out the punting unit .
 Here are the fan celebrating :
 The halftime show by Taylor Swift also got great review .
 The Kansas City Chiefs won their first title since the day of Len Dawson with a 54-51 triumph over the Rams .
 Patrick Mahomes threw for five touchdown and ran for one more .
 The Chiefs had made it into the big game after an overtime victory in the A.F.C . championship ; they won the coin toss and marched down the field to score , never giving the Patriots a touch .
 Every time Mahomes got the ball on Sunday there wa a sense that something exciting wa about to happen : a no-look pas , a rocket fired into a tiny space , an improvisation that made something out of nothing . About the only thing you knew you weren ’ t going to get wa a punt .
 The Rams gave a good a they got , with Jared Goff picking apart the unheralded Chiefs defense for three touchdown of his own . Todd Gurley provided fan of the running game something to cheer with a 100-yard effort .
 Chiefs Coach Andy Reid kept thing interesting , nearly throwing the game away late with puzzling clock management , repeatedly going into full huddle despite trailing with time expiring . But the error just made Mahomes ’ s eventual touchdown scramble with zero second on the clock all the more thrilling .
 The Chiefs now look poised to become the sport ’ s new dynasty with the 23-year-old Mahomes ready to star for year to come . But the ageless Brady and the Patriots , the resurgent Eagles or Steelers , the Saints and Rams will have something to say a well . It look like a golden age of Super Bowls is upon u .
 The Chiefs hometown paper celebrated :
 The halftime show by Cardi B. also got great review .
 Now wasn ’ t that more satisfying ? Maybe next year .

 With the closing of a Blockbuster store in Australia , the one in Bend , Ore. , will be the last to survive change in technology and shopping that reshaped the way people watch movie at home .
 By Tiffany Hsu
 Fifteen year ago , a movie fan could go into any of Blockbuster ’ s 9,000 store and walk out with a Steven Spielberg hit .
 Now , option are limited for those who want to rent a hard copy of “ Saving Private Ryan ” from somewhere other than a library . There are only two Blockbuster store left in the world . Very soon , there will only be one .
 The second-to-last Blockbuster , a squat blue-and-yellow slab wedged next to a real estate agency in Western Australia , will stop renting video on Thursday and shut down for good at the end of the month . Two store in Alaska , part of the final group of Blockbuster outlet in the United States , closed in July .
 That will make the Blockbuster in Bend , Ore. , one of a kind : a corporate remnant , just off the highway , near a cannabis retailer and a pet cremation service .
 [ Share your memory of Blockbuster in our comment section . ]
 But this is no elegy for Blockbuster , no lament for how Netflix killed the video star . There were plenty of those when the company filed for bankruptcy protection in 2010 , shriveled to 300 store and then mostly closed .
 This is about the ability of the Bend store , like sturdy link in other dying chain , to live on and avoid being turned into a pawnshop or a fast-food restaurant .
 Some Tower Records store still thrive in Japan long after their parent company declared bankruptcy and closed all of it American store . There is a Howard Johnson ’ s in Lake George , N.Y. , that is the lone survivor of what wa once the country ’ s largest restaurant chain .
 Such holdout have bucked the norm in the retail and restaurant industry , which have shed store by the hundred in recent year .
 The roll call of closing continued Wednesday , with the discount retailer Dollar Tree ’ s announcement that it would close up to 390 Family Dollar location this year . As of mid-February , retailer had announced 2,187 store closing in the United States this year , according to Coresight Research .
 But when Sandi Harding , the general manager of Bend ’ s Blockbuster store , heard that she would be running what is effectively the Lonesome George of video-rental chain , she posted a giddy message on Facebook : “ Holy Cow it ’ s exciting ”
 Blockbuster is such a throwback to another time that the trailer for “ Captain Marvel , ” which is set during the 1990s , open with the title character crashing through the roof of one of it store .
 The Bend store became a Blockbuster franchise in 2000 . It ha about 4,000 active account and sign up a few fresh one each day , Ms. Harding said . Some of the new customer are tourist who have traveled hour out of their way to stop in .
 Several call to the store ’ s landline on Wednesday were greeted by a steady busy signal or hold music ( the “ Star Wars ” theme ) . On sale inside wa Blockbuster-branded merchandise , including trucker hat , cup , even magnet made by a local teacher .
 The store ha several year left on it lease and a license agreement that it owner sign annually with Dish Network , which bought Blockbuster for $ 320 million in 2011 .
 “ It ’ s almost re-energized u , that we ’ re the last one , ” Ms. Harding said in an interview . “ They treat u like celebrity . ”
 A local beer maker , 10 Barrel Brewing , crafted a special beer , the Last Blockbuster , and served it at a party at the store . Two filmmaker raised nearly $ 40,000 on Kickstarter to finish a documentary about the location .
 One possible explanation for the store ’ s long life : Bend is in a region that the city ’ s mayor , Sally Russell , describes a having “ huge expanse with really small community ” that often do not have easy access to the high-speed internet necessary for content streaming .
 Many resident of outlying area stop at Blockbuster during their weekly trip to town to run errand , drawn in part by the store ’ s seven-day rental policy , Ms. Russell said , adding that the store ’ s last-in-the-world status could even give it a lift .
 “ It ’ s like with old vinyl , and how everyone want to have turntable again , ” she said . “ We get to a place where something out of date come back in — there ’ s definitely interest in keeping this almost-extinct way of enjoying movie alive . ”

 Lewis Rothlein start all over again .
 By Deb Amlen
 THURSDAY PUZZLE — The constructor Lewis Rothlein is a daily commenter here on Wordplay , and he ’ s back with his fourth puzzle for The New York Times .
 You may start it , and then you may start it again , but hang in there . You ’ ve got this . Just don ’ t forget to finish your sentence .
 There are many clue in this puzzle that are general knowledge — you either know them or you don ’ t — but you have the opportunity to learn them now . I ’ m not going to go through all of them , but feel free to Google anything you don ’ t know and store it away for next time .
 15A : Watch your parsing here . I solved using the Downs in this section , went back to reread what wa there and wondered , “ What kind of universal donor is ONE G ? ” The answer , of course , is O NEG , short for O negative .
 21A : I wa not familiar with the actress GIA Scala , who died in 1972 at only 38 , so I had to run the alphabet on this one until I got ENIGMA for “ Puzzle ” at 10D .
 40A : A sleeper cell is a very serious thing , and while I realize that this is a play on word , I ’ m torn on how it sits with me . The joke is that a cellphone that is sleeping is ON SILENT .
 57A : This made me chuckle . EAVE is not the most lively word to have in a crossword puzzle , and most homeowner don ’ t think about EAVEs on a daily basis ( unless a wasp nest ha been built under it — don ’ t ask me how I know that ) . But “ What go above and beyond ? ” is a fresh and funny clue , which always redeems a gluey entry .
 33D : “ The dark side ” seems to refer to the side of the Force where the enemy of the Jedi play in “ Star Wars. ” But it can also allude to the black portion of the YIN-yang symbol , which can connote femaleness , a opposed to the yang , which is white and can connote maleness .
 34D : I can ’ t believe I ’ m writing this , but “ Hi , kid ! ” The CONEHEADS were recurring character in a sketch on “ Saturday Night Live ” in the 1970s , and we thought they were hilarious . Seriously . They were a family of extraterrestrial from the planet Remulak with — wait for it — conical head who were stranded on Earth and forced to try to blend in . They first appeared in the 1977 season opener . Dan Aykroyd , who came up with the idea , claim that he wa inspired by the moai , or the statue of head on Easter Island , which just happens to have been one of our recent “ Words to Know . ”
 [ Watch the Coneheads on “ Saturday Night Live . ” ]
 37D : Fun one . In the clue “ Sleeper who never dream , ” the sleeper refers to a sleeper SOFA .
 61D : NGO stand for “ nongovernmental organization , ” which is a nonprofit , voluntary group that operates independently of any government to help with social or humanitarian issue . Doctors Without Borders and Oxfam are two example of NGOs .
 I am fairly rebus blind , but usually catch on after I ’ ve gotten at least one of the rebus element . Then Mr. Rothlein come along and change thing up . He make a puzzle with four different rebus in it .
 It ’ s for a good reason , though . He take the common phrase BACK TO SQUARE ONE — which also function a our revealer — and us it to explain why the theme phrase seem incomplete .
 At 16A , for example , the answer to the clue “ Saying suggesting that worldly possession should be enjoyed ” is [ YOU ] CAN ’ T TAKE IT WITH , and the word YOU is squeezed into that first box ( it also completes that 1D “ Feature of Cajun country , ” the BA [ YOU ] ) . The trick here is to read the phrase , go BACK TO SQUARE ONE , and reread that first word , completing the phrase “ YOU CAN ’ T TAKE IT WITH YOU . ”
 All the theme entry hit that sweet spot of being familiar and fun , a far a I ’ m concerned . If you need help on the remaining theme entry , click on any of the clue below :
 25A . Iconic introduction in cinema
 BOND , JAMES BOND

 36A . Instructor ’ s remark after making a mistake
 DO AS I SAY , NOT AS I DO

 48A . Insistent refusal
 NO MEANS NO

 My three other New York Times puzzle have also been Thursdays , a is an additional one in the queue , but don ’ t pigeonhole me just yet !
 When a search showed that BACK TO SQUARE ONE had been done a a theme before , but not like this one , I wa happily surprised . Will , Joel and Sam gave terrific suggestion for improving this — what keen eye they have !
 I liked the pair that showed up : Famous middle name ( ALVA , WALDO ) , enclosure ( PEN , CAGE ) , and thing in lock ( OAR , KEY ) . Some theme answer left on the cutting room floor : MOUTH TO , SEA TO SHINING , EYE FOR AN , NEVER SAY , LIVE AND LET , SUNDAY BLOODY , FOOD GLORIOUS , and an outlier that I secretly love , TORA TORA .
 I thought of the theme while walking my dog , who ha no idea how much he help me come up with puzzle idea and clue .
 Almost finished solving but need a bit more help ? We ’ ve got you covered .
 Warning : There be spoiler ahead , but subscriber can take a peek at the answer key .

 The new animated Lego movie is pretty much like the last one . Or maybe I ’ m thinking of another one , not that it much matter . There are difference between edition , most fairly negligible . The unifying factor , to note the obvious about the state of big-screen child ’ s entertainment , is that they are all feature-length commercial . The “ Transformers ” series helped pave the way for Legos by flipping the old idea that movie ( like “ Star Wars ” ) were the creative source for the licensed merch , the lunchboxes and action figure . Now , toy , board game and so on are sometimes the originating point .
 This isn ’ t news ; I know it , you know it . But it seems worth repeating again and ad infinitum , especially given that “ The Lego Movie 2 : The Second Part ” isn ’ t a distractingly fun , shiny and bright a the more satisfying franchise installment . It drag and sometimes bore , which make it easier for your mind to drift elsewhere , to thought of family , deadline , chore , the creative impoverishment of the big studio and the casual , fundamentally corrupt commercial exploitation of the child audience . Put differently , what distinguishes this from the better Lego movie is that they ’ re good commercial .
 The new one wa written by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller , the franchise ’ s brain trust , and directed by Mike Mitchell , whose credit include “ Trolls , ” another toy-based feature . “ The Lego Movie 2 ” mostly take place in Bricksburg , the happy town where once upon a time in the buoyant 2014 movie , Emmet ( voiced by Chris Pratt ) , an upbeat dude in an orange vest , triumphed to become a heroic master builder . Five year later , life in Bricksburg ha turned into a George Miller-esque dystopian hellscape . Emmet still look on the sunny side , but everyone else , including his pal , Lucy ( Elizabeth Banks ) , look like Lilliputian refugee in their own decrepit and sand-swept “ Mad Max . ”
 That sound more promising than what transpires in the movie , a busy , noisy clutter of action sequence , pop-cultural allusion , life lesson and cute critter . The clever if rather cynical , self-reflexive back story involves live-action scene of a bickering big brother and little sister who , unbeknown to Bricksburg , are the true master builder . The child ’ s disharmony make trouble in their play world , draining it of color and optimism ; in other word , everything is not awesome , to borrow the franchise ’ s insanely catchy theme song . There ’ s a tidy message here : Be nice to your kid sister , which is supernice advice especially because the movie wa produced , directed and written almost entirely by men .
 The exception is the animation director , Trisha Gum , who worked with Mitchell on the movie ’ s look and feel , which is by turn immersive and wittily distancing , a when the Bricksburg story is interrupted by a shot of a toy dangling from a string . One pleasure of the Lego movie is how they personalize generic plastic brick , creating a sense of life by combining scratch and other sign of the human hand — a if a child had used and reused these toy — with distinct , caricatured voice . Will Arnett ’ s demented take on Batman remains the standout , and it ’ s disappointing that he isn ’ t given more to do . In line with the live-action sibling , the under-inspired Emmet and Lucy drive the Bricksburg part .
 Much of the story involves an eerily smiley alien land ( shade of Camazotz in “ A Wrinkle in Time ” ) where Batman is to marry the polymorphous queen ( Tiffany Haddish ) . Every so often , the kid and their mom ( Maya Rudolph ) pop up in the live-action scene , and their family dissonance creates chaos and intimation of doom in Bricksburg until it doesn ’ t .
 The moral is that we should play nice , but also buy truckloads of Legos . In this respect , this sale pitch fit in with something that Walt Disney , a marketing genius , once said about his company not catering “ to the child but to the child in the adult. ” He wa talking about his film ’ viewer , who also happened to be the folk destined to foot the toy bill .

 Gary Cee begin our solving year .
 By Deb Amlen
 TUESDAY PUZZLE — UPDATE : The following is a message from Will Shortz about the entry at 2D .
 I ’ m very sorry for the distraction about BEANER ( 2D ) in today ’ s fine puzzle by Gary Cee .
 Neither Joel nor I had ever heard the slur before — and I don ’ t know anyone who would use it . Maybe we live in rarefied circle .
 In researching this puzzle , we discovered the other meaning of the word a a slur . Later , Jeff Chen over at XwordInfo brought it to our attention a well .
 My feeling , rightly or wrongly , is that any benign meaning of a word is fair game for a crossword . This is an issue that come up occasionally with entry like GO O.K . ( which we clued last April a “ Proceed all right , ” but which a a solid word is a slur ) , CHINK ( benign in the sense a a chink in one ’ s armor ) , etc . These are legitimate word .
 Perhaps I need to rethink this opinion , if enough solver are bothered . I want your focus to be on the puzzle rather than being distracted by side issue . But I assure you this viewpoint is expressed with a pure heart .
 Meanwhile , for any solver who wa offended by 2-Down in today ’ s puzzle , I apologize .
 Welcome back to Wordplay , and a whole new year of solving . Let ’ s dive right in with a puzzle by Gary Cee .
 Your mileage may vary , of course , but I found this to be a relatively easy puzzle whose theme did not pop out at me until I had stared at it for a while after solving . Sometimes those theme can be the most satisfying . The gratification is delayed , but when it hit you , it really smack you .
 1A : When the clue say “ First victim of sibling rivalry , ” it mean the very first . In this case , the answer is the biblical victim , ABEL , who wa not kept by his brother Cain .
 20A : I don ’ t want to spoil anything for anyone ( Don ’ t laugh ; we ’ ve actually gotten mail about this ) , so avert your eye if you haven ’ t seen the Star Wars movie . Eyes averted ? Good . Anakin Skywalker , nicknamed ANI , grew up to be Darth Vader .
 4D : Did you have _ _ T , a I did , and assume that the answer wa “ OUT ” ? Read the clue carefully : It refers to a “ chair umpire. ” You see those in tennis , so the answer is actually LET .
 Mr. Cee offer u a set of four phrase whose first word is something one can pas , a the revealer at 61A tell u : “ Barely adequate … or what the start of 17- , 26- , 37- and 50-Across are ” is PASSABLE .
 I clearly overthought this . At first , I thought that maybe the HAT , TORCH , TIME and BUCK were thing that were merely O.K. , just PASSABLE , but that made no sense .
 So I sat there and stared at the grid . Sometimes that ’ s all you can do : just sit there and wait for that smack in the head . Be patient ; the theme eventually come into focus .
 I ’ ll give you the first two : You can PASS the HAT and you can PASS the TORCH .
 Pretty cool find , Mr. Cee .

 The rapper , whose real name is Bobby Hall , ha branched out with a debut novel , “ Supermarket . ”
 CreditCreditRozette Rago for The New York Times

 Bobby Hall , better known a the Grammy-nominated rapper Logic , started writing his debut novel , “ Supermarket , ” four year ago . He had released “ The Incredible True Story , ” a dystopian concept album in which two men search for a planet named Paradise in the wake of Earth ’ s destruction , and finished the script for a film , “ Everything Must Go , ” now in development with J.J. Abrams ’ s production company , Bad Robot .
 He wa looking for a new project . “ I didn ’ t want to necessarily just be stuck in music , ” he said . “ Supermarket , ” just published by Simon & Schuster , is a psychological thriller that center on Flynn , an aspiring writer who ha been dumped by his girlfriend . Depressed and desperate for change , he take a job at a supermarket , hoping to find inspiration through daily minutia . But nothing is what it seems , and the novel quickly take twist and turn while tackling issue including depression and anxiety .
 It ’ s not the first time he ha addressed mental health in his work : His song “ 1-800-273-8255 , ” titled after the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline , ha gone platinum five time .
 Hall , 29 , recorded an accompanying soundtrack timed to the novel ’ s release this week . He doe not consider himself a big reader , he said , but credit Indiana Jones novel and H.G . Wells ’ s “ The Time Machine ” a inspiration for the kind of story he wanted to tell .
 “ Bobby is the quintessential multi-hyphenate . He ’ s a natural storyteller , ” Stuart Roberts , Hall ’ s editor at Simon & Schuster , wrote in an email . “ I wa instantly taken by the book ’ s voice and inventiveness . ”
 I talked to Hall about his debut a a writer , mental health , the importance of music to him and what he hope his fan will take away from this project .
 “ Supermarket ” deal with a number of mental health issue — from anxiety and depression to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder . What research did you do before writing the book ?
 The research I did wa all personal . I had an anxiety attack and almost passed out when I wa in line to see “ Star Wars ” in December 2015 . I wa in the most depressed , anxiety ridden place of my life . My mother wa bipolar . She took heavy medication to deal with it , and I grew up with friend who were schizophrenic , so I experienced that firsthand .
 Did you face any challenge while writing the book ? How did the process differ , if at all , from writing music ?
 One of the biggest challenge wa writing something that stemmed from real life . Nobody want to talk about anxiety and depression and being scared and feeling crippled at time . It ’ s not a fun thing to discus . I have written script for my album before , I have done concept album , so I guess it is something that ha been building up .
 What do you hope reader to take away from it ?
 I guess the biggest thing is a long a you deal with your problem head-on and face your demon , whatever they may be — mental , physical , emotional — if you truly deal with it , it get better . And that you can do anything you want . I am a dude with no formal education . I didn ’ t even graduate from high school . But you can ’ t let that tear you down .
 Your character listen to a lot of contemporary music and artist , like Toro y Moi and Rex Orange County . Can you talk about the relationship between music and the novel ?
 I thought it would be really cool if when reader see that artist ’ s name and the song on that page , maybe they will play that song while they read . We tend to associate our emotion and experience with what we are listening to or watching . I just thought it would be cool to add these artist who have given me great memory and pas that on to reader .
 Are there any other song or album or artist you were listening to while writing the book ?
 Oh , definitely — I actually created a playlist on Spotify .
 Did you always know that you were going to record the soundtrack ?
 It definitely came from writing the book . I wa at my old house and making these song about love . I wa feeling kind of lonely , and I realized that is also how Flynn felt . When I wa writing these song for a woman that didn ’ t even exist at the time , it kind of hit me like , I want to do more than just rap . I love hip-hop , I love rap , it ’ s in my blood . And it is scary a a musician to have a world of people who know who you are , and that when you do something different , different is not good . Nobody like different . These were song that almost would have never come out because I would have been too scared . But I think that fear is a good thing .
 Let ’ s talk about the album . How doe it relate to the book ?
 It ’ s not like my other album — that is why I am so proud of it . It ’ s all indie music , and if you listen to this playlist you can hear some element of that in the soundtrack a well .
 It ’ s really based on love , and I ’ ve never done that . I did a couple of love song in rap when I wa 20 and didn ’ t know a thing and I ’ ve gone through some ups and down ; I have gone through some very hard time ; and beautiful , amazing time . So I decided to write about those , and kind of put myself in Flynn ’ s position and almost sing a though I were him and be inspired by my own life .

 Richard E. Grant wa at one of his favorite restaurant in London , having dinner with his daughter , when suddenly both burst into tear . The management rushed over : what wa wrong ? Nothing . Grant had just been nominated for an Oscar , for his supporting turn a a colorful accomplice in the literary biopic “ Can You Ever Forgive Me ? ” ( To celebrate , the staff comped his meal . )
 Grant , the British actor whose lengthy résumé encompasses villain both ridiculous ( “ Spice World ” ) and sci-fi ( “ Logan ” ) along with episode of “ Downton Abbey ” and “ Doctor Who , ” and the forthcoming “ Star Wars : Episode IX , ” wa uncharacteristically agape at being a first-time honoree . “ Actors , mid-50s onwards , your part , your salary , it ’ s diminishing return , ” he said . “ I ’ m almost 62 year old . I ’ ve never been nominated for anything . So it ’ s beyond anything I could even begin to imagine . ”
 A few minute after he got the news , he wa on the phone with his co-star Melissa McCarthy , nominated for best actress for her unusual dramatic turn , a the writer-turned-forger Lee Israel . “ She could barely speak either , ” he said . “ We were just a blub fest . No shame in being a grown man cry . ”

 The film , a period piece based on Israel ’ s memoir of the same name , trace her path from biographer to literary counterfeiter , convincingly faking signature and letter from the like of Noël Coward and Dorothy Parker until she wa eventually busted by the F.B.I . It ’ s an unexpected story to see onscreen : both star are somewhat unlikable .
 “ I ’ ve been surprised at how generous audience have been in kind of taking these two near-destitute , on-the-fringe criminal , full of loneliness and despair in early ’ 90 New York , that people have rooted for them and identified with them , ” Grant said . Their misfit friendship struck a chord .
 His character , Jack Hock , is based on a real person , about whom very little is known ; he wa gay and had AIDS . “ I think the assumption wa , he ’ d been disowned by his family — there are no photograph of him . What little there is is featherweight information in Lee Israel ’ s actual memoir , ” Grant said . His performance , he added , is “ an homage to those men who died in the ’ 80 and ’ 90 , before there seemed to be any possibility of an antidote . ”
 But Grant ha brushed up against Israel ’ s contemporary . “ I met somebody at a Screen Actors Guild screening in New York last week , who said that in real life she wa far grumpier and far more deadly than Melissa McCarthy portrayed her , ” he said , “ and that her apartment wa an absolute pit of filth . He said it seemed quite sanitized in the film , but I don ’ t know that you could take an audience further into that Hieronymus Bosch territory . ”
 Grant ha been unusually – and hilariously — unfiltered on the award circuit ; even with McCarthy , he ’ s the uproarious one in the room . “ I wa born without that button , that filter in your brain that stop what come into your brain from going out of your mouth — to my cost , sometimes , ” he said .
 So , what doe he make of his first go-round on the path to the Oscars ?
 “ What nobody warns you about is that when I went a a complete innocent to the Telluride Film Festival , where the film premiered , at 4 o ’ clock on a Saturday afternoon , I had no idea that five month later , I would still be banging the drum for the film , ” he said . “ I had no idea that when someone said to me , you do realize it ’ s on a campaign , and you will not be earning any money — though you will be royally looked after . But what ’ s money ? This is much better , because the response and approbation ha been a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity . ”
 Moneywise , he could always do a sequel to “ Spice World. ” Is that in the work ?
 “ No . But a Posh Spice is unavailable for the reunion world tour , I ’ m going to be taking over her for , a Posh Old Spice . I ’ ve got my leg in training a we speak . ”

 Expect the canyon of Broadway to echo with shout and scream this spring — and moaning and groaning and lamentation of an exceptional amplitude and ferocity . And I ’ m not referring to ticket buyer who have just registered what an orchestra seat will set them back , or not only that .
 Rather , I ’ m referring to two star , much celebrated for their combustible presence on stage and screen , who will be taking on part in which being able to generate high dudgeon at high volume is a primary job requirement . That would be the British actress Glenda Jackson , in the rage-filled title role of Shakespeare ’ s “ King Lear , ” and the unlikely American heartthrob Adam Driver , who is portraying what might be described a an emotional arsonist in the first Broadway revival of Lanford Wilson ’ s 1987 drama “ Burn This . ”
 As is the case with many of this season ’ s main-stem offering , the road to New York for this “ King Lear ” and “ Burn This ” ha hardly been a straight line . They ’ re each arriving later than wa originally anticipated — and in somewhat altered form .
 Lear is the part in which the then 80-year-old Ms. Jackson , a two-time Oscar winner who had left acting to become a member of Parliament , returned to the London stage after an absence of more than two decade . That production , directed by Deborah Warner at the Old Vic in 2016 , reaped such ecstatic notice for it star that it wa widely assumed it would be crossing the Atlantic posthaste .
 Ms. Jackson did indeed show up on Broadway a little more than a year later . But it wa not a Shakespeare ’ s ultimate angry old man but a the angry old woman of Edward Albee ’ s “ Three Tall Women , ” for which Ms. Jackson won a Tony for Best Actress in a Play .
 Now , a mere ( and one hope , for her , very restful ) year later , Ms. Jackson will be reincarnating the most challenging role in the Shakespeare canon , but with a different director and supporting cast . The “ King Lear ” opening in April at the Cort Theater will be staged by Sam Gold , who showed an original and subversive hand for Shakespeare in starry production of “ Othello , ” with Daniel Craig and David Oyelowo , and “ Hamlet , ” in which Oscar Isaac wa the Prince of Denmark . ( His “ Lear ” cast Ruth Wilson a both the King ’ s Fool and one of his daughter . )
 “ Burn This , ” an intense , four-character study of love and grief in a New York loft , had been expected to come to the Hudson Theater in early 2017 . That production wa to be headlined by Jake Gyllenhaal — in the role of a foul-mouthed , cocaine-hoovering restaurateur named Pale — and directed by Michael Mayer . It wa subsequently announced that because of “ scheduling conflict with the show ’ s star , ” the opening of “ Burn This ” would probably be “ during the 2017-2018 season . ”
 The version of “ Burn This ” finally scheduled to open on April 16 will , a promised , be staged by Mr. Mayer at the Hudson . But it Pale is now Mr. Driver , playing opposite Keri Russell a a dancer in mourning ( for her recently deceased roommate , Pale ’ s brother ) .
 Mr. Driver will be competing with cherished memory of John Malkovich , whose scorching performance a Pale 32 year ago sealed his reputation a a dominating star . Theatergoers still talk about Mr. Malkovich ’ s splenetic , warp-speed opening monologue .
 Though Mr. Driver ha appeared on New York stage before — notably in revival of “ Look Back in Anger ” ( directed by Mr. Gold in 2012 ) and Terence Rattigan ’ s “ Man and Boy ” ( 2011 ) — it wa in supporting role of relative calm , meant to ballast the showier , fierier leading part played by Matthew Rhys ( in “ Anger ” ) and Frank Langella ( in “ Man ” ) .
 But anyone doubting Mr. Driver ’ s ability to do bad , mad and dangerous need only take a look at his subsequent screen work , including his turn a the arch-villain Kylo Ren in the recent “ Star Wars ” film . Or check out his set-incinerating fight with Jemima Kirke in the Season 5 finale of HBO ’ s “ Girls. ” Theatergoers attending “ Burn This ” might do well to wear asbestos .
 As for Ms. Jackson , no one ha doubted her capacity for delivering annihilating rage since she destroyed the hulking Oliver Reed in Ken Russell ’ s 1969 film of “ Women in Love. ” Nor should anyone question this octogenarian ’ s capacity to “ howl , howl , howl ” nightly against the bleak and cruel universe of “ Lear . ”
 Speaking last year of her performance a Lear in London , Ms. Jackson said matter-of-factly , “ I expected to do it eight time a week , because that ’ s the way I ’ ve been raised . When the first additional matinee went in , the whole cast wa asking me how I wa , they were afraid I wa going to die in the middle of it .
 “ The only time I ever felt tired wa on Sundays when we didn ’ t have to do it . Because there ’ s so much energy in the play , ” she said .
 Cosmic rage , it would appear , is a great rejuvenator .

 NEW YORK — With more TV streaming service than ever before , from newcomer like Disney Plus to stalwart like Netflix , consumer may feel the ideal viewing experience is finally at hand .
 Americans have , on average , three streaming video subscription service , according to a recent study of digital medium trend by Deloitte . While some have dropped cable and it average bill of around $ 100 a month altogether , about 43 % have both pay TV and streaming subscription .
 Yet patching together a variety of service to get just what one want is n't always seamless . Families and individual can still find themselves with service that doe n't perfectly suit their viewing habit . And those monthly subscription can add up fast .
 `` It doe n't make sense to pay for a bunch of content you have no interest in watching , '' said Bruce McClary , vice president of marketing for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling . `` Finding a service that let you scale your channel lineup based on your interest can also help you avoid paying for thing you do n't need . ''
 A little research on which service are best for you can help save big buck .
 FOR FAMILIES
 Disney is making the biggest play for family viewership . The owner of Disney Channel , the Star Wars franchise and most recently Fox 's entertainment business is betting it mix of family-friendly franchise and beloved animated classic , along with original programming , will make the Disney Plus service irresistible to family , even if they already subscribe to other service . The service , launching Nov. 12 , will cost $ 7 a month initially .
 For some kid , there may be no substitute for watching Disney 's `` Frozen '' over and over again . But other service that family might already subscribe to have a lot of family-friendly programming too . Amazon Prime ( $ 119 per year or $ 13 per month for Prime loyalty program membership ; Prime Video alone cost $ 9 a month ) , Hulu ( $ 6 to $ 12 per month ) , and Netflix ( $ 9 to $ 16 per month ) all offer kid programming .
 Another choice for parent : HBO Now ( $ 15 a month ) is the home for the classic kid TV show `` Sesame Street . '' And for spendthrift , YouTube 's free Kids channel offer an endless stream of kid-friendly fare , although quality varies widely .
 FOR MOVIE BUFFS
 Movie fan will soon have to work a bit harder to find movie to stream . As Disney , Fox , Universal and Warner Brothers and others offer their own streaming service , they will all eventually pull their content from Netflix . But niche service are there to fill the void .
 Classic movie can be difficult to find streaming . Movie fan suffered a loss when AT & T , which bought Time Warner last year , decided to discontinue FilmStruck , a streaming service that wa a collaboration between Turner Classic Movies and the Criterion Collection . But a similar service called The Criterion Channel that offer 1,000 classic and contemporary film is stepping up to fill the void . It cost $ 11 a month or $ 99 for a year .
 Other movie-centric streaming service include Fandor ( $ 6 per month or $ 50 per year ) or Mubi ( $ 11 per month ) . Both offer a curated selection of movie .
 Those on a budget can try Kanopy , a streaming service that work with public library and university to offer library card holder streaming movie for free .
 FOR SPORTS FANS
 Sports fan do have streaming option , but they cost more since sport must be watched live . Basic live TV option are cheaper but may not include sport channel . Which service you choose depends on which sport or which team you want to watch .
 There are a variety of live TV streaming service that offer a wide range of sport , but they 've recently been raising their price . Fubo TV offer more than 85 channel including one that broadcast football , baseball , soccer and other sport . It cost $ 45 for the first month , then $ 55 a month after that . DirecTV Now cost $ 50 a month for the cheapest tier . Sling TV cost $ 25 to $ 40 a month . Hulu raised the price for it live-TV service in February , by $ 5 , to $ 45 . Sony 's PlayStation Vue cost $ 45 to $ 80 a month . Google 's YouTube TV is increasing it monthly fee to $ 50 . It launched at $ 35 and ha raised price a it added more channel . Most of the live TV service offer the major sport channel such a Fox Sports and NBC Sports Network , a well a game broadcast on network TV . But ESPN , for example , is on Hulu Live and YouTube TV but not Fubo TV , so fan of a specific team or sport should examine the channel listing for each service .
 There 's no budget offering for watching high profile sporting event . But Disney 's ESPN Plus cost $ 5 a month or $ 50 for the year . It offer some live game , including some hockey , soccer and baseball game , a well a content about sport like ESPN 's `` 30 for 30 '' documentary series . But you ca n't watch most major league sport game on the service .
 MIX AND MATCH
 If you 're a sport fan who also love movie and ha a family , you 'll have to mix and match service while trying to stay within your budget . It is still possible to stay below the monthly cost of cable , say the NFCC 's McClary .
 `` The acceptable threshold for spending is up to each household , but most 'live ' and 'on demand ' streaming service would be on the low end of the scale compared to traditional cable package , '' he said . `` One good measuring stick is to compare the monthly rate to your monthly content consumption pattern and what it would cost if you paid movie rental rate each time you watch a program .

 WASHINGTON — The heaven part . The light shine down . The rise in the ocean begin to slow . The world is once more bathed in the mystical glow of a messiah . Our redemption from Donald Trump is at hand .
 We have The One again , a New One — another lanky , bookish , handsome man with an attractive young family , a thin résumé , an exotic name , a hip affect , a rock star aura , an enticing smile , a liberal press corp ready to fluff his pillow and a frothing Fox News .
 Let Elizabeth Warren knock herself out with policy proposal . Let Kamala Harris be the adult in the room . Let Bernie Sanders bellow away .
 The magical man-boy , Beto O ’ Rourke , ha come back from his 40 day in the desert — vlogging , contemplating , floating in and out of a funk — to share his gift .
 He ha given u the blessed news : “ Man , I ’ m just born to be in it. ” He told Vanity Fair that his word at a Texas campaign stop when he wa trying to unseat Ted Cruz were pulled out of him “ by some greater force , ” musing : “ Everything that I said , I wa , like , watching myself , being like , How am I saying this stuff ? Where is this coming from . ”
 Annie Leibovitz advised Beto to wear a blue button-down shirt for her Vanity Fair cover shoot if he wa going to run . And now we can hear , a Hillary Clinton noted sardonically about Barack Obama in 2008 , “ celestial choir . ”
 Beto float above the fray , staying vague on nettlesome issue . The 46-year-old offer the politics of feeling .
 “ I don ’ t have a team counting delegate , ” he told Vanity Fair , adding , “ It ’ s probably not the most professional thing you ’ ve ever heard about this , but I just feel it . ”
 Joe Kennedy built his family ’ s political myth on good hair , white teeth and glossy star quality . Why shouldn ’ t Beto ?
 After all , during his 2008 campaign , Obama merely went back to Chicago to see Malia perform in “ The Odyssey. ” Beto loved the epic so much , he thought about naming his son “ Odysseus , ” settling instead for “ Ulysses . ”
 Wandering alone , a Jesus , Barack and Beto did , is part of the hero ’ s journey defined by Joseph Campbell . Beto love Joseph Campbell and “ Star Wars , ” which wa inspired by Campbell ’ s work .
 The last One , about the same age when he jumped into national politics precociously aiming to usurp his elder , wa also a uniter who went on an odyssey of self-discovery in New York while at Columbia .
 The last One also sold a cult of personality , offered himself a a symbol of modernity , sparked Oprah ’ s interest and had a preoccupation with being cool .
 Indeed , Obama told David Axelrod recently on “ The Axe Files ” that Beto reminded him of himself .
 The One anointing the New One . Joe Biden , pushed aside by Obama in the last election , wa understandably irritated .
 Just a reporter once swooned when Obama made like Jay-Z and brushed imaginary dirt off his shoulder after a tough primary debate in Philly in 2008 , reporter were entranced when O ’ Rourke air-drummed “ Baba O ’ Riley ” by the Who at a Whataburger drive-through after his debate with Cruz .
 To many , Beto ’ s appeal is his persona a a quasi-rebellious ’ 90 suburban teenager , a skateboarding punk rocker who seems to have modeled his campaign logo on the spicy ketchup logo at Whataburger .
 But others are le charmed . A satirical video on Twitter by skater mocked “ bad-skater Beto ” a the kind of middle-school poser who “ went to Zumiez and spent $ 27 on sticker . ”
 In a new Reuters story , Joseph Menn reveals that while O ’ Rourke wa still a teenager , he wa a member of the Cult of the Dead Cow , a stealthy hacking group named after an old Texas slaughterhouse . A kind of Neo-lite , he used the handle “ Psychedelic Warlord , ” looking for free video game . ( Socialist alert ! )
 A hacker might be refreshing after a president who refers to Tim Cook a Tim Apple . Still , Menn writes , “ it ’ s unclear whether the United States is ready for a presidential contender who , a a teenager , stole long-distance phone service for his dial-up modem , wrote a murder fantasy in which the narrator drive over child on the street , and mused about a society without money . ”
 The 15th entry in the Democratic race is at the nexus of many tricky issue for a party desperate to oust Individual 1 from the White House .
 Is it better to nominate a celebrity like Obama with a slight record that can not be targeted or someone with established credential ? Should the nominee spring from the far left , the vector brimming with electricity and fight , or is that suicidal in a national election ?
 Can white men jump in , or is this post- # MeToo era the time when Democratic and independent woman will demand a woman at the top of the ticket ? Will Democratic voter longing for another Obama and the minority voter who strayed from Hillary want an African-American ?
 Can pugilistic progressive stomach a rich kid like Beto at a time when the country is in an eat-the-rich mood ? Will they tolerate candidate like Beto and Biden , who speak well of Republicans and have a history of working with them ?
 As The Wall Street Journal report , O ’ Rourke tried to please Texas Republican business leader when he “ opposed Obamacare , voted against Nancy Pelosi a the House Democratic leader and called for a raise in the Social Security eligibility age . ”
 The fever is running high in his party . Will Beto turn out to be born for it or borne away by it ?

 Wednesday ’ s unveiling of the first image of a black hole — found in the Messier 87 galaxy , roughly 55 million light-year away — ha captured the imagination of scientist and amateur astronomer around the world . But of all the intriguing and humbling phenomenon to be found in outer space , why are black hole such a particular fascination ?
 Maybe it ha something to do with science-fiction , which ha long exploited the narrative possibility offered by these inescapable region of space ( a in the movie “ High Life , ” which debut this week ) . What follows is a look at some of the best streamable movie in the black hole canon : We can ’ t guarantee all the science , but we can tell you where to find them .
 [ Read about the first ever image of a black hole . ]
 How to watch : Rent or buy it on Amazon , iTunes , Vudu , Google Play and YouTube .
 Walt Disney Productions had a humble goal for this ( then ) big-budget production : Two year after “ Star Wars , ” the company wanted a blockbuster space opera of it own . According to the book “ The Mouse Machine , ” by J. P. Telotte , the studio took notice of the increasing chatter in scientific circle about black hole ( Archibald Wheeler had coined the term in 1967 ) , revising the original script and focusing on the crew of a deep space mission and it discovery of not only a black hole but also another ship that somehow managed to elude the gravitational pull . Reviews were mixed , and the film recouped only it cost . But it did introduce an important new element to Disney filmmaking : computer-generated animation .
 How to watch : Stream it on The Criterion Channel ; rent or buy it on Amazon , iTunes , Google Play , Vudu and YouTube .
 Perhaps no single scientist shaped more of our contemporary thought and fascination with black hole than the theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking , whose idea about black hole , quantum mechanic , radiation and relativity were neatly packaged in his 1988 best-seller “ A Brief History of Time : From the Big Bang to Black Holes. ” Four year later , the director Errol Morris ( “ The Thin Blue Line ” ) released his documentary film adaptation of the book , featuring extensive interview with Hawking and his colleague , friend and family , intermingling his biography with vivid and ingenious visualization of his thought and theory . Hawking ’ s work is dense and complex , but Morris ’ s dazzling film furthers the source book ’ s mission of making the science of space a bit more understandable to the layperson .
 How to watch : Stream it on Showtime ; rent or buy it on Amazon , iTunes , Google Play , Vudu and YouTube .
 The new image from Messier 87 wa possible , in a large part , because of a network of radio antenna known a the Event Horizon Telescope . That name ha a logical tie to it target : The event horizon is “ the edge of a black hole , the point of no return , ” according to the Times reporter Dennis Overbye , who note , “ beyond the event horizon , not even light can escape the black hole ’ s gravitational pull. ” But it will summon a different connotation to movie fan . Paul W.S . Anderson ’ s “ Event Horizon ” make black hole into horror fodder , telling the story of a vessel that creates an artificial black hole in order to make a space travel wormhole . Suffice to say , thing go very wrong .
 How to watch : Stream it on Amazon ; rent or buy it on Amazon , iTunes , Google Play , Vudu and YouTube .
 Science-fiction television show , like the later iteration of “ Star Trek ” and “ Battlestar Galactica , ” have made black hole a mainstay of their storytelling . But the “ Star Trek ” film series hasn ’ t had much use for them , with the notable exception of J.J. Abrams ’ s 2009 reboot of the franchise . Nero ( Eric Bana ) , the Romulan villain of the film , us the principle of the black hole for dastardly end , creating an artificial black hole out of “ red matter ” to destroy the planet Vulcan . But then a real black hole creates a time warp that sends Mr. Spock back in time to help Captain Kirk and his own younger self try to stop Nero . ( It all make sense in the movie . )
 How to watch : Rent or buy it on Amazon , iTunes , Google Play , Vudu and YouTube .
 This Kubrick-inspired sci-fi adventure from Christopher Nolan hang a key plot point on black hole : The deep-space crew at it center , led by the former NASA pilot Joseph Cooper ( Matthew McConaughey ) , is sent to explore a wormhole leading to potentially habitable planet . But the wormhole ’ s proximity to a black hole cause gravitational time dilation ; in the brief time Cooper and another crew member ( Anne Hathaway ) spend exploring one of the planet , 23 year of earth time elapse , causing duress for the scientist . Nolan , known for his meticulousness , took great pain to try to ensure that the science of the film checked out , and it rendering of the black hole wa considered by many to be the most realistic yet in a fiction film .
 How to watch : Stream it on Netflix ; rent or buy it on Amazon , iTunes , Google Play , Vudu and YouTube .
 “ Mr . Morris conveys something of what Dr. Hawking think about black hole evaporation , imaginary time and curved space , ” The Times ’ s Timothy Ferris wrote about Morris ’ s “ A Brief History of Time. ” “ But for most viewer , these exotic idea will be overshadowed by the human drama of the great physicist ’ s triumph over adversity. ” The director James Marsh focused firmly on that drama in this biopic , with an Oscar-winning Eddie Redmayne a a young Hawking and an Oscar-nominated Felicity Jones a his future wife , Jane . As they struggle to come to term with a motor neuron disorder that confined him to a wheelchair for the rest of his life , he develops his initial theory about the visibility of black hole — though there is not much time to get into scientific specific .

 Welcome to Best of Late Night , a rundown of the previous night ’ s highlight that let you sleep — and let u get paid to watch comedy . If you ’ re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV , sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendation straight to your inbox .
 President Trump indicated on Thursday that he is considering declaring a national emergency if Congress doesn ’ t deliver funding for a border wall . Jimmy Kimmel questioned whether it made any sense to spend money primarily meant for confronting natural disaster on a wall .
 “ He ’ s making plan now to declare a national emergency on the border . The idea , I guess , is to declare an emergency and then take money that ha been earmarked for real emergency , like flood and hurricane , and use it for a wall that won ’ t do anything instead . Sometimes I ’ m kind of amazed he only bankrupted three casinos. ” — JIMMY KIMMEL
 Trump often tell horror story about what happens at the border , and he ’ s recently made two allegation that caught reporter ’ attention : that woman are often tied up with duct tape by Mexican smuggler , and that Muslim prayer mat have been found strewn at the border . Kimmel pointed out that these claim have something notable in common — and it ’ s not just that they ’ re unsubstantiated .
 “ The White House looked into this and found no evidence to back up the president . It ’ s a bad sign when even the White House is like , ‘ We have no idea what he ’ s talking about either. ’ And even nuttier , someone figured this out : The prayer mat and duct tape , these were all plot point from the movie ‘ Sicario. ’ So , it ’ s a good thing the president hasn ’ t seen ‘ Star Wars , ’ because he ’ d probably be asking for money to build the Death Star. ” — JIMMY KIMMEL
 Trump sent a snappish tweet on Thursday arguing that people should “ stop playing political game ” by using term other than “ wall ” to describe the proposed barrier . Seth Meyers reminded Trump that he himself is the one who ha used alternate word , even going so far a to say the wall could be called “ peach . ”
 “ Hey — you were the guy who wanted to call it slat ! This is like Diddy tweeting out , ‘ My name is “ Sean Combs , ” damn it ! ’ ” — SETH MEYERS
 With temperature far below freezing in New York , Jimmy Fallon told a few joke about the daunting weather .
 “ It wa freezing cold in New York City today , with a wind chill that wa down to negative 17 . Even crazier , that ’ s still higher than Trump ’ s approval rating. ” — JIMMY FALLON
 “ Yesterday a bunch of college were closed . This morning it wa so cold , student were doing the run of shame. ” — JIMMY FALLON
 Then he got the audience going in a game of “ How cold is it ? ”
 “ It is so cold , earlier today the Empire State Building shrunk 50 floors. ” — JIMMY FALLON
 “ It is so cold , Trump is actually enjoying being burned by Nancy Pelosi. ” — JIMMY FALLON
 “ A new study suggests that a parasite found in cat pee can be linked to schizophrenia . Finally , a reason to stop drinking cat pee ! ” — SETH MEYERS
 “ A man in Japan recently claimed to have dated a cockroach for over a year that he named Lisa . The man said Lisa really hit it off with his friend and family , especially his ant. ” — SETH MEYERS
 “ The president beat the cold this morning by tweeting so much his phone began to act a a space heater . He tweeted 11 time before 10 a.m. this morning. ” — JIMMY KIMMEL
 On “ Jimmy Kimmel Live , ” Kimmel ’ s sidekick Guillermo gave Bill Belichick — the Patriots ’ coach , known for wearing arms-free hoodies — a custom-made poncho .
 Fallon impersonated Howard Schultz after a nationwide listening tour : “ Just like a true Starbucks barista , I didn ’ t hear the word properly . To me , it sounded like , ‘ That ’ s a great idea , you should really run for president . ’ ”

 Participants in virtual race run whenever they can , wherever they can , and say they still have some of the sense of being part of a crowd , even if they ’ re running alone .
 By Jen A. Miller
 On a recent Sunday morning , Kate Silvester ran a 5K . She didn ’ t have to worry about where to park to get to the starting line in time : She just headed out to a biking and running path behind her house and onto a back road .
 Her race wa a virtual 5K associated with the NYC Half , which wa run in New York the same day .
 Virtual challenge and run are part of a growing trend in recreational running : doing a race whenever you can , wherever you can , and still feeling a if you ’ re part of the crowd , even if you ’ re running alone .
 Bob Bickel , founder of the race registration platform Run Sign Up , said the organization saw virtual race pop up “ in earnest ” about five year ago . One of the first popular virtual run , he said , wa that of Jeff Galloway , a running coach who train runner using a run-walk-run method . In 2018 , 1,050 people finished Mr. Galloway ’ s virtual event , which included a 5K and half marathon .
 “ People are used to running with their apps , and I think more and more people are comfortable with connecting virtually , ” Mr. Bickel said , “ whether it ’ s on Facebook or Instagram or Snapchat , people can actually have friendship even though they don ’ t see each other . ”
 Ms. Silvester , 44 , of Plainsboro , N.J. , said her first virtual run came through the tracking app Run Keeper . In 2017 , she wa new to the sport , and she ’ d been using the app to track her progress . She saw that she could participate in a “ challenge ” event , where runner who donated $ 35 to Beat Nb , a nonprofit that fund research for the childhood cancer neuroblastoma , got a T-shirt for completing the run .
 She ’ d done traditional race before , but a a single mother of two who work full time , she liked the flexibility of something virtual .
 Virtual run are structured in various way .
 Disney ’ s Virtual Run 5K series started in 2016 and us the honor system . Runners can download bib to wear to do the virtual run . When they finish one — or all — of the three 5Ks in the series , they can download a finisher ’ s bib and are mailed a medal .
 “ It wa an interesting opportunity for u to really keep people involved with runDisney year round , ” said Faron Kelley , vice president of Disney Sports . Most on-site runDisney event are held in cooler month , so the Virtual Run 5K series is held in the summer . Last year ’ s series , which wa themed to “ The Incredibles , ” had about 18,000 participant . This year ’ s series , with registration opening on May 7 , is Marvel themed , with each 5K costing $ 40 ; doing all three , which includes a fourth medal for completing them all , cost $ 145 . RunDisney also put on a virtual Star Wars Half Marathon in the winter and early spring — for 2019 , it cost $ 59 ( and is open through March 31 ) .
 The Great Pumpkin Run virtual race series also us the honor system . For $ 35 , runner are mailed a race hoodie and a bib . Previously , the race sent race medal after runner submitted their time , but this year , Courtney Young , co-founder of the race , said medal will be mailed along with the hoodie and bib . “ People want that instant gratification , ” she said . Ms. Young said the race ha also worked with Strava , an exercise tracking app , but it ’ s not a requirement ; they trust that runner aren ’ t lying .
 The Great Pumpkin Run started a a traditional race series in 2012 , but the virtual option ha taken off since it wa introduced in 2016 . The first year , 300 runner did the virtual option ; last year there were close to 14,000 . “ I think it ’ s helping people get into the sport , ” Ms. Young said . It appeal to runner who may not be able to show up to a race on a certain time and day , or who are intimidated by running with other people in their first race .
 The New York Road Runners added virtual run to it race roster in 2018 , and this year it ha 12 , most themed to a holiday or event , like the Resolution Run 5K or the Valentine ’ s Duo 5K . It also had a virtual half marathon and 5K connected to last weekend ’ s NYC Half , the one Ms. Silvester ran .
 The New York Road Runners ’ virtual race are free , unless runner are using them a a way to get into a sellout race . In 2018 , the organization opened 500 spot for runner to run a virtual marathon , which , if they completed it , would get them a race medal and guaranteed entry into the New York City Marathon this year ( it cost $ 150 , compared to $ 295 to run in the actual marathon ; they also got a finisher medal but no finisher shirt ) . For guaranteed entry into the 2020 Brooklyn Half Marathon , runner can sign up for and complete each of six virtual race , at $ 20 per race . They also get access to a virtual trainer a part of their fee .
 While runner can use whatever GPS watch or app they want to track their run , they must upload it into the Strava app in order for it to count .
 The virtual run started with the question of “ how can we continue to engage and extend our impact across the global running community and provide way in which people can run with u without being here in New York City ? ” said New York Road Runners president and chief executive Michael Capiraso .
 For Ms. Silvester , Sunday ’ s virtual run wa part of her recovery from an injury . “ It wa only my third run since getting back from injuring my hip flexor , so I took it pretty slow and included walk break , but I did it , ” she said .
 She ’ s hoping to do the Brooklyn Half next year , which would be her first half marathon . “ It ’ s hard to picture myself getting to a half marathon in the next year or so , but it wa good to get back into running after a long break , ” she said .

 Having wrapped up their reviewing duty for 2018 , our chief film critic , Manohla Dargis and A. O. Scott , look back at a year of rage , silliness and sublimity at the movie and ahead to the 91st Academy Awards .
 A. O. SCOTT If I had to pick one movie moment to sum up 2018 , it would probably be the last scene of “ Support the Girls , ” Andrew Bujalski ’ s workplace comedy about the manager of a Hooters-like bar and grill in Texas . Not enough people paid attention when the film wa released in August , but Regina Hall ’ s performance ha picked up some award and nomination since then , and everyone should stream it right now .
 Anyway : The movie end with three woman — Hall , Haley Lu Richardson and Shayna McHayle — screaming on a roof . Not in terror ( a woman onscreen so often do ) , but in rage , frustration and a kind of righteous , rebellious glee . They are venting and protesting , having endured an endless cycle of everyday racism , sexism and exploitation . As an ending , it feel triumphant and bleak at the same time , which may be why I keep coming back to it .
 MANOHLA DARGIS I wa up on that roof , at least in spirit . In some way , this sisterly scream is the signature image for the past year . Scarcely a week ( a day ! ) went by without a powerful man being called out for his alleged sexual misconduct , most publicly of course during the fraught Brett Kavanaugh nomination hearing . At the same time that we were witnessing this profound reckoning , we were also seeing a number of female-driven movie , most of which — it ’ s important to recognize — had finished shooting before news of the sexual harassment accusation against Harvey Weinstein broke in October 2017 .
 Oddly , when I watched the roof interlude in “ Support the Girls ” I flashed on the scene in Bernardo Bertolucci ’ s “ Last Tango in Paris ” of Marlon Brando screaming — he ’ s cursing God — under a thundering overhead train . Bertolucci died in November , and his artistic legacy is forever linked , and rightly so , to allegation of abuse from that film ’ s co-star , Maria Schneider . In 2007 , she said that while shooting it most infamous sex scene she felt humiliated and “ a little raped , both by Marlon and by Bertolucci. ” The allegation feel emblematic of the destructive power imbalance in an industry that ha marginalized and victimized woman while giving free license to male abuse .
 No wonder woman are yelling .
 SCOTT A few year ago you and I examined the state of female representation in movie , and found that it wa improving , meaning that a wider range of role seemed to be opening up . But in retrospect a lot of those role — the variety of strong , raunchy and badass comic and action heroine who emerged in the early and middle part of this decade — look like they were designed to deflect criticism or prove a narrow point : that girl could be just a tough , violent , brave or naughty a boy . This boldness wa accompanied by a certain anxiety about losing the male audience , anticipating the tantrum that would later be thrown by some fragile “ Ghostbusters ” and “ Star Wars ” fan .

 In some way , thing haven ’ t changed so much . In a recent essay in Buzzfeed , Alison Willmore note that “ 2018 ha been a rich with slogany , simplified woman ’ s empowerment callouts a it ha been with reason for woman to be filled with rage and dread. ” She single out “ On the Basis of Sex , ” Mimi Leder ’ s film about Ruth Bader Ginsburg ’ s early career , and “ Ocean ’ s 8 , ” Gary Ross ’ s # squadgoals heist picture with a cast including Sandra Bullock , Cate Blanchett , Mindy Kaling and Rihanna .
 But the careful , superficial conventionality of those movie highlight the complexity of so many others . It ’ s worth listing some of them , just a a reminder of how much feminist argument there ha been in and about movie this year — how central the question of woman ’ s anger , power and autonomy have been in popular culture and politics more generally . In no particular order , and in addition to the one we ’ ve already named , I would mention “ Revenge , ” “ Widows , ” “ The Favourite , ” “ The Wife , ” “ Suspiria , ” “ Destroyer , ” “ Can You Ever Forgive Me ? ” “ Roma , ” “ Eighth Grade , ” “ A Wrinkle in Time , ” “ Madeline ’ s Madeline , ” “ Let the Sunshine In ” and “ A Simple Favor. ” It ’ s not that all of them offer equally plausible or positive image — they ’ re not all good movie ! — but that filmmaker seem interested in the politics of woman ’ s experience in a way that feel different . One measure of the difference is that for the first time in I don ’ t know how many year the field of potential Oscar best actress nominee look much wider and more interesting than the potential best actor .
 DARGIS It ’ s great to see so many female-driven story , though — a you say — not all are good or feminist . “ Widows ” and “ Ocean ’ s 8 ” put a spurious sisterly spin on old-fashioned American greed . Both would have been better and more honest if their character were just a openly mercenary a any male movie thief and didn ’ t try to soften these woman ’ s crime with tear and rationalization . By contrast , because “ Support the Girls ” lead with the lived-in , different truth of it character , it feminism is organic , not performative or programmatic . “ Roma ” focus on one woman , but , unlike most American movie , also look at that life in the larger world of structural oppression .
 Taken together , all these movie — the good , the bad , the blah — are welcome just because they offer an actual range of different female role and diverse idea about woman ’ s place in the world . Some of these idea are stale and the moviemaking is dreary or worse , but I ’ m glad they exist . A movie like “ The Wife , ” for instance , is so devoid of aesthetic interest that the only thing we can discus is how it frame power and gender while letting it title character — who ha been long complicit in her husband ’ s literary fraud and his exploitation of her — off the hook .
 “ The Wife ” is calibrated for maximum audience flattery : viewer are encouraged to nod in recognition at the literary milieu and clap their hand in self-congratulatory glee at the husband ’ s fall . Men , bad ; woman , good — it feminism is irritatingly reductive , but it doe make the movie topical fodder especially in 2018 , a year that ha reminded u that feminism speaks in many different voice . Some of these voice are radical and forward-thinking while others seem discouragingly stuck in the same era a , well , “ Green Book , ” yet another movie that seems mostly interested in making it audience — here , presumptively white — feel good about it own racial sensitivity .
 SCOTT I love that “ The Wife , ” most of which take place in Stockholm during the Nobel Prize ceremony , wa released shortly before the Swedish Academy canceled the literature prize because of a sexual harassment scandal . I hope someone ha optioned that kerfuffle — which is too baroque and weird to summarize — for a movie . Maybe Yorgos Lanthimos , fresh off the power game of “ The Favourite . ”
 Films like “ Sorry to Bother You , ” starring Tessa Thompson and Lakeith Stanfield , had more on their mind than comforting fable of finger-lickin ’ harmony .
 Ah yes , “ Green Book. ” It ’ s sort of mind-boggling that Peter Farrelly ’ s compendium of tone-deaf racial clichés arrived on screen in the same year a “ Sorry to Bother You , ” “ BlacKkKlansman ” and “ If Beale Street Could Talk. ” It seems to come not only from a bygone era but from a whole different cinema planet , one governed by feel-good piety that were dubious here on earth even back in the 1960s . The voting membership of the Academy circa 1987 would have given all the prize to “ Green Book , ” but in 2019 it prospect are decidedly cloudier .
 Not that Boots Riley , Spike Lee and Barry Jenkins represent a unified perspective on black life and American racism , or that they are in perfect political and imaginative harmony with one another . Hardly , and thank goodness . But all of them are interested in offering something other than comforting fable of finger-lickin ’ harmony . And even though “ Beale Street ” and “ BlacKkKlansman ” are set in the ‘ 70 , while “ Sorry ” unfolds in a speculative near-future , each one explicitly address the unfinished business of the present .
 Which is what I want : movie that , rather than arriving at pat or reassuring conclusion , embrace the complication of reality and invite the audience to really think about it . Mostly this year I found that in documentary and in other movie made at some distance from the American commercial mainstream .
 DARGIS At this point it feel a if the remaining big studio have nothing to offer other than recycled idea and brand , with some exception . I like some of the box office behemoth — mostly , I like “ Black Panther ” — but too many of them were numbingly familiar in every way , narratively , tonally , whatever . This isn ’ t new or news , but it ’ s bleak that “ Avengers : Infinity War ” receives attention simply because it is from Marvel . Each of it movie is just a delivery system for that brand , though this one did encourage me with the promise that it character and this franchise are finally goner .
 Disney ha been the dominant player for a while and , a it power ha grown , each of it new movie feel like a product launch : The release of the new Marvel , Star Wars or Pixar movie is greeted like the release of the latest iPhone , including the rabid-dog medium attention it generates . There are modification , some nifty new feature , but it ’ s mostly the same , just pricier . This seems like how thing worked in classic Hollywood cinema , which depended on both standardization ( through product quality control and storytelling norm , for instance ) and differentiation ( in the diversity of film and star and so on ) .
 The current big-studio model , though , is more focused on sameness than difference . Each new addition to the franchise can ’ t be meaningfully different enough to mess with the brand . That ’ s partly what make “ Black Panther ” interesting : It doesn ’ t just swap out one Chris for another ( Chris Hemsworth ’ s Thor instead of Chris Evans ’ s Captain America ) . It introduces idea and character that are so strong , so in excess of what we normally see — African-American identity , Afro-futurism , Michael B. Jordan ’ s performance and the very figure of Killmonger — that they become bigger and more important than the Marvel brand and story beat .
 SCOTT It turn out that when “ diversity ” mean something more than pandering or tokenism — when , a in the case of “ Black Panther , ” an African-American filmmaker can claim the freedom to explore the cultural and political valence of an African superhero — a worked-over franchise can be revivified . That ’ s what Ryan Coogler did to the Marvel Universe . ( He ’ d already done it to the “ Rocky ” cosmos with “ Creed , ” which he bequeathed to his fellow U.S.C . alum Steven Caple , Jr . )
 Something similar happened , on a more modest scale and with a more playful sensibility , in “ Spider-Man : Into the Spider-Verse , ” which brought an ingenious , unforced pluralism to the Peter Parker mythos . What if the radioactive spider happened to bite the Afro-Latino son of a police officer and a health care worker ? It ’ s a fascinating question if the answer is handled with appropriate wit and authenticity , a it wa by the gang at Sony Pictures Animation .
 Marvel Comics ha been exploring these kind of story for a while , steadily eroding the white-male monopoly on superhero status in print . I ’ m glad the movie ’ s incarnation of those story are starting to follow suit ( and not only in the Marvel universe , to be fair ) . My political quarrel with “ Black Panther ” — wait , where are you going ? — ha to do with it commitment to monarchism and to Wakanda ’ s appropriation of Silicon Valley techno-neoliberalism a it guiding ideology . Superheroism remains a profoundly anti-democratic undertaking . I wish the great Senegalese filmmaker ( and novelist , labor organizer and political gadfly ) Ousmane Sembène were still around , so he could take up the next chapter in the franchise . Or maybe Disney would hire Raoul Peck ( “ Lumumba , ” “ I Am Not Your Negro ” ) or Abderrahmane Sissako ( “ Bamako , ” “ Timbuktu ” ) to direct a stand-alone Killmonger adventure , one that rescue that misunderstood villain from the condescension of comic-book history . The next phase of the dialectic is surely the synthesis of Marvel and Marx .
 A fellow can dream , anyway .
 DARGIS Keep dreaming , and I mean that in the nicest way , comrade . That “ Black Panther ” inspires such revery — and indeed wa one of the most exciting , idea-generating movie of the year — is further proof that it difference are profound , even if it is another male-driven heroic tale . It ’ s the kind of big-studio release that make me think that the world of American industrial moviemaking isn ’ t a creative wasteland . Its impact even make me look forward to the next Oscars . ( Not really . )

 Good morning .
 An atmospheric river storm ha gripped Northern California this week , pouring almost two foot of rain on part of Sonoma County and swelling waterway .
 Santa Rosa had it rainiest day in recorded history on Tuesday . Residents of Guerneville , a small , picturesque Wine Country resort town , were trapped by rising floodwaters . The storm also led to canceled flight out of San Francisco and closed road across the region .
 All this make it feel almost inconceivable that only month ago , much of Northern California wa devastated by fire , and that a raging blaze almost completely wiped out a community .
 In the week and month that followed the Camp Fire , resident of Paradise returned to find their hometown in ruin .
 I recently talked to Shane Grammer , an artist who grew up in nearby Chico and ha worked on installation at Disneyland , Universal Studios and Legoland . Now based in Los Angeles , he said he started to see image of the destruction posted by people he knew .
 “ The fire didn ’ t really hit home for me until friend I grew up with started posting on Facebook , ” he said . “ It ’ s not devastation where in six month , everything ’ s going to be normal . ”
 One friend ’ s home had burned , but the chimney wa still standing . He asked if he could paint a mural on the chimney , continuing a series he had been working on of image of a woman ’ s face , inspired by a story from the Bible .
 “ The woman represents u , or people — it kind of challenge me to say that God really love me , ” he said .
 He painted the mural — in three hour . And viewer on Facebook were moved .
 Mr. Grammer ended up going back to the area for a week , spray-painting image on burned-out car and other rubble . On another wall , he painted a portrait of Helen Pace , an 84-year-old woman who died in the blaze .
 He completed 12 piece in all , with homeowner ’ permission , and the response from community member ha been powerful , he said .
 “ They ’ re so grateful and thankful for beauty among the ash , ” he said .
 Jeana Darby , who work for Hope Christian Church , told The Washington Post that the portrait of Jesus that Mr. Grammer painted on the church ’ s “ charred baptismal is a encouraging a the wooden cross still standing after the wall burned to the ground . ”
 But Mr. Grammer knew that the work wa temporary from the start . “ They will all be torn down , ” he said .
 And that , Mr. Grammer said , is part of the healing .
 “ My goal is to move people emotionally , and I think with tragedy and heavy issue , doing artwork for me is also a way to process , ” he said .

 The store , which closed after 36 year in the East Village , wa a haven in my youth .
 By Jeffrey Lewis
 Mr. Lewis is a musician and comic book author .
 I stopped in to St. Mark ’ s Comics one day last week to paw through what wa left of the merchandise , a few day after the store ’ s owner , Mitch Cutler , announced a going-out-of-business sale .
 On Sunday , after 36 year in business , the store finally closed for good . I ’ d been buying comic book there since it opened , when I wa 7 year old , but I had never known Mitch ’ s last name . To me and my younger brother , Jack , the guy in the store wearing glass wa always just Mitch . We didn ’ t talk much . Most of the time I knew what I wanted and where to find it .
 I remember when my mother first told me there wa a store that sold nothing but comic book : It wa a fantastical concept , unheard-of , dreamlike . I pictured an enormous , hushed , dim place , where comic book lay in row of cubbyhole , like a candlelit library . St. Mark ’ s Comics wasn ’ t like that , but with it characteristic attribute of clutter and classic rock radio it wa still a funky little temple of reverence .
 By the time the store appeared in the East Village at the top of the stoop at 11 St. Marks Place ( the store used an apostrophe in it name ) , the much larger comic book store Forbidden Planet on 12th Street and Broadway wa already in business . The difference between the two could be read in their name . Forbidden Planet wa a world in itself , with two huge floor of publication and toy and display window of Star Wars figure in cosmic battle , but it also held danger — dozen of grotesque Halloween mask and gory poster for flick like “ Zombie ” and “ Evil Dead ” that could torment me for many bedtime to come . St. Mark ’ s Comics wa the neighborhood shop , no bigger ( or le overstuffed ) than our own East Ninth Street railroad apartment . It wa more like home .
 With no television in our countercultural household I had always had comic book fever . I loved reading comic book and I loved making comic book . At St. Mark ’ s I absorbed all the education I could . I learned which writer and artist I liked best and which day of the week new comic arrived . As I grew into my teenage year “ Rom Spaceknight ” and “ The Amazing Spider-Man ” were replaced by “ Sin City ” and “ V for Vendetta , ” while St. Mark ’ s Comics expanded to become two store side by side , one featuring new issue and one selling back issue .
 I became friendly with Don Vance , a few year my elder , who worked the register and tried to steer me toward what he considered the higher echelon of taste , independent comic like “ Nexus ” and “ Cerebus the Aardvark. ” Seeing the St. Mark ’ s Comics Facebook page this week I wa amused to find out that I wasn ’ t the only customer who read “ The Fountainhead ” in the early ’ 90 on Don ’ s suggestion ; I also learned that Don had since died . We didn ’ t agree on Ayn Rand or “ Cerebus , ” but we did share a reverence for the prolific author and comic book writer Alan Moore .
 As year passed I found fewer comic I wanted to buy at St. Mark ’ s . The store ’ s priority wa mainstream title , while my own taste had moved toward alternative comic . My lifelong dream of becoming a comic book creator got sidelined a I got sucked into the world of another local establishment : the Sidewalk Cafe on Avenue A , where my fledging open-mic appearance in the late ’ 90 had turned into fledgling gig there , then a life of making my living in music . My comic book output became relegated to self-publishing an issue every couple of year a touring schedule allowed .
 My annual holiday season pilgrimage to St. Mark ’ s Comics with my brother , Jack , this past December wa much like in other recent year — bittersweet . We browsed every familiar corner of the shop , directly downstairs from it original home , but we found nothing new from our favorite indie creator , like Daniel Clowes , Julie Doucet and Ben Snakepit , and we left empty-handed .
 I didn ’ t leave empty-handed on my final visit , though . In the half-priced back issue I found a “ Power Man and Iron Fist ” issue that featured a Rom Spaceknight guest appearance , which I had somehow missed in the 1980s . I also found Mitch in his usual unassuming role at the back of the shop , and I handed him a “ thank you ” card I had drawn in the form of a miniature comic book , complete with plastic sleeve and backing board .
 We exchanged the usual two or three word . I almost asked if there were any other customer who had been coming there from beginning to end , but I just paid for my find ( $ 2.72 ) and left . I had other goodbye to attend to : Sidewalk Cafe on Avenue A is closing it door this month , too .

 Good morning .
 ( Here ’ s the sign-up , if you don ’ t already get California Today by email . )
 Overheard LA is an Instagram account that lightly skewer a certain strain of millennial culture that seems to flourish in Los Angeles .
 Its founder , Jesse Margolis , started the account — which now ha 1.2 million follower and seven spinoffs , including Overheard San Francisco — on a whim in 2015 , after listening to a stereotypically L.A. conversation at a health food store .
 Now , Mr. Margolis is steering the brand in a new direction , with ( gasp ) a printed “ newspaper , ” The Overheard Post , which feature a “ millennial weather report ” and satirical “ obituary ” for thing like plastic straw .
 The brand now ha five staff member and employ freelancer .
 Recently , I talked to Mr. Margolis about getting Overheard ready for life after Instagram . Here ’ s our conversation , edited and condensed for length and clarity :
 Jill Cowan : Hi Jesse , thanks for taking the time to talk .
 Jesse Margolis : I appreciate it . My job today ha been literally delivering newspaper . ( Laughs . )
 Yeah , so tell me about that . You decided to get into the print game , which I can tell you is tough .
 We ’ ve got these eight account now with city and theme and we ’ re kind of exploring how that brand manifest itself in different area .
 The newspaper idea is our first foray — it ’ s half marketing stunt . We ’ re essentially going to be doing a newsletter . My idea for our newsletter is it ’ s offline only , and then if you want to actually read it online , you might be able to get it 24 hour later or a week later .
 Are you worried at all about Instagram a a platform for your business ?
 That ’ s one of the reason we started to explore these other thing like a newspaper , the newsletter , because we have a great presence on Instagram but we are kind of siloed there . We don ’ t want to be on just one platform .
 I am sure you ’ ve been asked this question a million time , but do you make any effort to vet whether these thing actually happened ?
 We aren ’ t journalist — we basically do our best . I think half of the overheard stuff is legit overheard stranger . I think a lot of it is like a group of five friend drinking and talking . And someone spontaneously say something funny and the friend send it in .
 We ’ re curating user-generated content , but we ’ re also directing it toward millennial theme in a different way . The reason the account are successful is because we ’ re not just posting some dumb quote — we ’ re focusing on these theme of dating and digital life and food and fitness and Instagram culture and all that stuff . So we definitely do our best .
 Obviously , the account play to the more absurd element of L.A . But do you feel like your perception of L.A. ha been shaped at all by the work that you ’ re doing ?
 It ’ s interesting because our account capture the sort of extreme that we ’ ve all seen a little bit living in L.A .
 We ’ re trying to make fun of the bubble and occasionally we can get caught in the bubble ourselves by doing that , and not necessarily showing just how unique and diverse L.A. ha become . I wish the whole of L.A. wa reflected more in the account .
 But I think the other thing I ’ ve learned is just how clearly we are now living in two world : the real world , IRL . And this “ Black Mirror ” thing happening .
 What make me laugh about the newspaper is that I ’ m old enough to remember when everyone wa off line scrambling to establish a presence online . And now I started something online . And I ’ m trying to establish it presence offline .

 Adam Driver is a great disrupter .
 This volcanic actor ’ s entrance in the lopsided new revival of Lanford Wilson ’ s “ Burn This , ” which opened on Tuesday at the Hudson Theater , is prefaced by a fanfare of violent pounding . It is 5 a.m. , in a loft in Lower Manhattan . And it sound a if the Incredible Hulk , feeling very impatient , is in the hallway — or maybe a runaway cyclone .
 When the door open , what is revealed behind it doe not disappoint . With long , flailing limb and a face molten with anguish , Mr. Driver explodes into view with an outsize fury that make everyone and everything around him seem Lilliputian . And a production that ha so far felt pleasant and prosaic is flooded with the anarchy of life in extremis .
 The last time I can recall such an impressively violent Broadway entrance wa more than 30 year ago , when a rising actor named John Malkovich appeared in the same part . Playing a coked-to-the-gills restaurant manager named Pale , Mr. Malkovich seemed to morph overnight from quirky character actor into a leading man of dangerous sex appeal .
 Theater lover still talk about the excitement of that performance . And I would wager that decade from now , people will be speaking with the same gratified wonder of Mr. Driver ’ s very different but equally compelling Pale .
 Though he ha appeared on Broadway before , it ha been in supporting role in period British drama — “ Mrs . Warren ’ s Profession ” ( 2010 ) and “ Man and Boy ” ( 2011 ) — that fitted him like genteel straitjacket . With “ Burn This , ” directed by Michael Mayer and co-starring Keri Russell , he is finally allowed to unfurl onstage the distinctive energy and insight that have characterized his subsequent performance in film ( the current “ Star Wars ” series ) and television ( HBO ’ s “ Girls ” ) .
 That unleashed force is plied most artfully here to create a portrait of how grief unhinges , disarranges and heightens everyday life . Set in the late 1980s , “ Burn This ” ass the impact of the death of a young dancer named Robbie , Pale ’ s brother , in a boating accident .
 The tragedy brings Robbie ’ s roommate , Anna ( Ms. Russell , in the part for which Joan Allen won a Tony in 1988 ) and Larry ( Brandon Uranowitz ) , a well Anna ’ s boyfriend , Burton ( David Furr ) , into contact with someone they might otherwise never have met . That ’ s Pale , a product of working-class New Jersey who ha had little recent contact with the much younger , artistic-minded and gay Robbie .
 [ Adam Driver and Keri Russell on the appeal of ‘ Burn This . ’ ]
 The play begin shortly after Robbie ’ s funeral . Anna , who ha recently made the transition from dancing to choreography , ha returned to their apartment , a loft space a open a a dance studio and a lonely a a desert . ( Derek McLane designed the set , lighted with a brooding clarity by Natasha Katz . ) Having just met Robbie ’ s family for the first time , she ’ s marveling at how she could have known so little about someone she thought she knew so well .
 The opacity of people — even to themselves — is a leitmotif in “ Burn This. ” So is the hunger to reach beyond the ordinary , to see and feel on an epic scale . Burton , a rich-boy screenwriter , and Anna speak of creating work that wrests them from the rut of what they ’ ve always done . They need , in Burton ’ s word , “ to reach for the sun . ”
 As embodied by Mr. Driver , Pale isn ’ t reaching for the sun ; he ’ s a solar entity unto himself . You believe him when he say his normal body temperature is about 110 degree and that “ I got like a toaster oven that I carry around in my belly someplace . ”
 Addled with drug and drink , rabid with grief and guilt , Pale arrives — in the play ’ s second scene , to collect his brother ’ s belonging — a a flesh-and-blood example of life lived large . He ’ s an alien in the civilized Bohemia of the others .
 He ’ s even an alien to himself , wrestling in exasperation with his own body , which register emotion a physical pain , and the Armani-style dud he always wear . ( Clint Ramos did the era-appropriate costume . ) Even more than Mr. Malkovich did , Mr. Driver make u aware that real grandeur doesn ’ t always come in the expected , esthetically pleasing package .
 If Mr. Driver bestrides “ Burn This ” like a colossus — could he really be only 6-foot-2 , a Wikipedia ha it ? — everyone else seems to shrink beneath his shadow when he ’ s onstage . You could argue that this is appropriate .
 But earlier production — including the 2002 Signature Theater revival , which starred Edward Norton and Catherine Keener — made it clear that this drama is indeed a “ pa de quatre , ” to use the language of dance , about the distance among people . In Mr. Mayer ’ s version , the play might be titled “ Waiting for Pale . ”
 This is partly because Ms. Russell , a first-rate television actress ( “ The Americans ” ) , never seems in any way undone — not by sorrow , not by creative frustration and not by her character ’ s gravitational attraction to Pale , with whom she fall into bed almost immediately . She tell Pale that he scare her .
 Yet despite her physical daintiness in comparison to Mr. Driver ’ s looming heft , her Anna always seems in charge , like a nanny with an unruly , overgrown toddler . To borrow from Lady Gaga , Ms. Russell ’ s performance remains comfortably “ in the shallow , ” instead of in the deep end into which Anna is plunged .

 When she deftly swap chummy barb with Mr. Uranowitz — who ably fill the now shopworn role of the sardonic but ultimately wise and caring gay confidant — “ Burn This ” can feel like a dry run for the long-lived TV series “ Will and Grace. ” And the most intriguing erotic chemistry here isn ’ t between Pale and Anna , but between Larry and Mr. Furr ’ s straight ( and very good ) Burton .
 I hasten to add that Mr. Driver isn ’ t grandstanding at the expense of the rest of the cast . Part of the pleasure of watching him come from seeing how this overwrought lug relates so awkwardly and unnaturally to others . When he kiss Anna goodbye , it ’ s with the stiffness of a little boy unaccustomed to display of affection .
 But this “ Burn This , ” which is steeped in the rich compassion for the lonely and lost that is the hallmark of work by Mr. Wilson ( 1937-2011 ) , only rarely stir the heart . In the ideal production , it creates the sense of fire meeting fire in a folie à deux between two ill-matched yet inexorably bound lover . What we have in this case is a one-man conflagration .

 Warning : This article contains some spoiler about “ Captain Marvel , ” but no cat pun .

 For a breakout star , it wa a fairly mundane audition . To cast the part of Goose , an orange tabby who play a critical role , the maker of “ Captain Marvel ” were meeting different cat , including Ursula Brauner ’ s Reggie . “ We walked into a roomful of people , and I brought a big plush bed and set it on the table , ” Brauner recalled . “ Reggie hung out on the bed and wa a chill a any cat could be , and the filmmaker saw him embody the character then and there . That ’ s how he got the job . ”
 “ Captain Marvel ” earned more than $ 500 million worldwide in it first week of release , in no small part thanks to Reggie and three fellow feline who steal scene a the stray who is revealed to be a ferocious alien known a a Flerken . ( In the original Marvel comic book , the cat ha the “ Star Wars ” -esque name of Chewie , but the screenwriter changed it to Goose to go along with the movie ’ s “ Top Gun ” motif . )
 Goose , who got his own character poster even before the movie wa released , ha been singled out by reviewer ( “ Best of all there is an orange cat , ” A.O . Scott wrote in The Times ” ) , inspired meme and been the subject of an ode . Kevin Feige , the president of Marvel Studios , even speculated that Goose could star in short on the streaming service being started by Marvel ’ s owner , Disney .
 [ How this movie could solve Marvel Studios ’ woman problem . | Mar-Vell explained . ]
 Although special effect were involved , the actual animal are onscreen a fair amount , but at first it wa going to be just Reggie . “ After looking at the script and seeing the work required , we all decided it would be good to add a couple more cat to the team , ” said Brauner , whose company , Animals for Hollywood , provides and train nonhuman actor for film . In addition to Reggie and another experienced animal actor , Archie ( yes , they ’ re named after Archie Comics character ) , Brauner found two more orange tabby , named Gonzo and Rizzo in a nod to the Muppets , at a shelter .
 Each one had a specialty . “ Reggie wa our all-around go-to cat — he ’ s seen in most of the film , ” Brauner said . “ Archie is really rambunctious and love to play , so we used him for the scratching scene. ” The movie , set in 1995 , depicts the S.H.I.E.L.D . agent Nick Fury ( Samuel L. Jackson ) suffering a cat-related injury , necessitating his signature eye-patch . ( The comic ’ explanation that he lost an eye in World War II didn ’ t jibe with the movie ’ s timeline . )
 “ Gonzo wa mostly for holding in the scene when Goose is carried , ” Brauner continued . “ And Rizzo wa the master of all trade — we trained him in a little bit of everything , so he could step in if we needed backup . ”
 How do you train notoriously finicky cat ? Brauner said the process wa not a tough a you might think . “ Cats can be just a smart , lovable and easy to train a any dog , ” she said . “ It ’ s all positive reinforcement . We use food and treat , and there are different level . We save the real good , hot stuff for when something ’ s a little harder or we ’ re further away from the cat on the set , just to make it worth their while . ”
 Verbal command and clickers were also used . “ When they ’ ve done something right , the sound of the clicker is like an instant ‘ Yes ! ’ ” Brauner explained . “ They look forward to that , because they know a pet or a little piece of chicken or liver is coming . ”
 The cat also eagerly anticipated interacting with their two-legged co-star . “ Sam always gave them treat , ” Brauner said . “ Every time they saw Sam , it wa like , ‘ Oh , I remember you ! ’ ”
 And even though Ben Mendelsohn play an alien who fear Flerkens , he couldn ’ t resist cozying up to the cat either . “ His costume wa a challenge , because he looked so different from a normal person , ” said Brauner , who wa given one of the character ’ s prosthetics-heavy suit to use in training . Once shooting began , “ Ben would always take the opportunity to hang out with the cat and make them feel comfortable , and they really needed that . ”
 What about Brie Larson , who star a the titular superheroine ? “ She ha an allergy , but it never affected u or the cat , ” Brauner said . “ She wa wonderful and always open to helping u , and I really respected her for that . ”
 Even after four month of pre-production training , the cat couldn ’ t perform some action that Flerkens can , like shooting tentacle from their mouth . “ That ’ s when special effect came in , ” Brauner said . “ Sometimes , like in the jet when the G-force is pushing Goose back , that wa computer-generated , but a lot of it wa Reggie , no C.G . needed . The filmmaker did a much a they could just with him . ”
 Brauner said the most difficult part of her job wa “ getting the cat used to working on a chaotic movie set. ” That ’ s also why Reggie didn ’ t actually attend the film ’ s premiere , although separate shot were taken of him wearing a tiny tie on the red carpet : “ We try to make sure we don ’ t bring him out in public where something could go wrong , like a loud noise . ”
 Still , should they be asked to return in any future Marvel movie — or short for a streaming service — Brauner said Reggie and the gang are ready for action . “ I truly don ’ t know if that will happen , ” she said . “ We ’ re always up for that kind of challenge . ”
 Goose ’ s popularity “ surprised u a much a anybody , ” Brauner said . “ But a lot of it is Reggie — his charisma absolutely shine through . ”
 Brauner said fame hadn ’ t changed the cat . “ We try to keep them grounded , ” she joked . “ We ’ re good parent and make sure it doesn ’ t go to their head . ”

 Will there be a dangerous new era of unchecked nuclear weapon development ?
 By The Editorial Board
 The editorial board represents the opinion of the board , it editor and the publisher . It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section .
 Before the fear of being blown up on a plane , or a train , or a sidewalk gave million of people sleepless night , before the threat of global climate disaster stirred dread , nuclear annihilation wa the stuff of nightmare .
 By the mid-1980s , the United States and the Soviet Union had amassed 63,000 nuclear weapon , with the promise of mutually assured destruction if even one were ever used , even accidentally .
 Then , after year of global protest and skyrocketing budget , American and Soviet leader stepped back from the brink and began a process of arm control diplomacy , accelerated by the fall of the Soviet Union , that shrank those arsenal by nearly 90 percent . For decade , that process and that diplomacy continued … until now .
 President Trump and his Russian counterpart , Vladimir Putin , who control 90 percent of the world ’ s nuclear weapon , are preparing to abandon the 1987 treaty that eliminated ground-launched ballistic and cruise missile with range of 310 mile to 3,100 mile . They have yet to begin serious talk on extending a 2010 treaty that reduced the nuclear warhead deployed on intercontinental ballistic missile and other strategic system , and the Americans , in particular , don ’ t appear to have any interest in doing so . Washington and Moscow are also modernizing old weapon system and building new one , at a cost of $ 494 billion over the next decade in the United States alone .
 At the same time , Pakistan , India and North Korea are expanding their arsenal a the international consensus for nonproliferation erodes .
 Experts with The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists , who evaluate the nuclear threat , last month judged the current state of affair to be “ a worrisome a the most dangerous time of the Cold War . ”
 The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty of 1987 , which eliminated 2,692 ground-based missile , is part of a web of arm control agreement that have managed the threat . Mr. Trump is right to blame the Russians for beginning to unravel the I.N.F . treaty during the Obama administration by testing and then deploying a cruise missile banned by the treaty .
 But he wa wrong to assert in his State of the Union address that he had “ no choice ” other than to withdraw from the treaty , a move that take effect in August .
 His threat to “ outspend and out-innovate all others by far ” in the production of weapon of mass destruction wa chilling , particularly given Mr. Putin ’ s vow of a “ symmetrical ” response .
 “ If our American partner suspend their participation in the I.N.F . treaty , so will we , ” he said on Feb. 2 . “ And if they start working on new weapon , so will we . ”
 It ’ s unlikely the treaty will be revived , given the deterioration of Russian-American relation , despite Mr. Trump ’ s promise of warmer tie and a coziness that ha drawn the scrutiny of the special counsel Robert Mueller .
 The pact ’ s imminent collapse ha intensified concern that the United States and Russia will let the 2010 New Start agreement , with it cap on deployed nuclear warhead , intercontinental ballistic missile and heavy bomber , a well a requirement for verification and data exchange , expire in 2021 . ( Start stand for Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty . ) Absent an extension or a new treaty , the nuclear arsenal will become unregulated — meaning there will be no legally binding , verifiable limit on the American or Russian nuclear arsenal — for the first time since 1972 .
 Adding to the uncertainty , Mr. Putin ha warned that Russia is developing new “ invincible ” hypersonic missile that will travel at more than five time the speed of sound .
 The United States , meanwhile , is developing a new conventionally armed intermediate-range missile that could one day be deployed in Europe . By the end of the year , Washington may be ready to field a low-yield nuclear weapon that could make it easier to use nuclear weapon without courting Armageddon .
 Last month , Mr. Trump threatened to unsettle the nuclear landscape even further by promising to reinvent American missile defense , a quixotic vision reminiscent of President Ronald Reagan ’ s unfulfilled “ Star Wars ” program .
 Mr. Reagan appreciated the danger of nuclear war and the value of negotiated agreement that could reduce weapon . The New Start number can go even lower . It ha been over seven year since the two power held serious nuclear arm reduction talk . The United States , it ally , even the Russians will be le safe if that process atrophy .
 With Democrats now in control of the House , the new chairman of it Armed Services Committee , Adam Smith of Washington , plan to hold what could be the most fundamental public examination of American nuclear doctrine in decade .
 If Mr. Trump continues to push for an expanded nuclear arsenal and abandon the strategic arm accord , Congress should freeze the nuclear modernization budget and block funding for new weapon .
 The commitment to spend billion of dollar to upgrade the aging nuclear arsenal wa part of the Faustian bargain President Barack Obama made with Senate Republicans to win support for the New Start pact . He did so with the hope that it would help lead , eventually , to a world with no nuclear weapon .
 Outspending Russia on a nuclear arm race , a Mr. Trump ha bragged he would do , or abandoning an arm control regime that ha helped forestall nuclear war for decade , is a foolish game of chicken , with no possible winner .

 When winter finally come to the HBO epic with one last batch of episode , it ha a lot to answer for .
 By Jeremy Egner
 In the Season 7 finale of “ Game of Thrones , ” Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen hooked up , Viserion demolished the Wall , Arya killed Littlefinger and Jaime finally left Cersei . By the end the show had boiled the roughly 9,000 subplots it introduced over seven season down to two : Jon and Dany ’ s coalition of the willing vs. Cersei and Euron the mad pirate . And the White Walkers vs. everyone .
 But thing are far from settled . When “ Game of Thrones ” return for it eighth and final season on April 14 , here are a few of the question it will need to answer :
 Don ’ t count on it . In the Season 8 premiere the new couple , last seen entwined in their love boat , arrives at Winterfell ( a seen in the trailer ) . And who else is at Winterfell ? Bran , who know Jon is Dany ’ s nephew , and Samwell Tarly , who know that this give Jon a better claim on the Iron Throne than Dany . It ’ s enough to complicate any new romance .
 Another thing about Sam : His best friend Jon is now dating the same woman who torched his father and brother last season . So that should be fun .
 [ Want exclusive “ Game of Thrones ” interview and news , a well a the internet ’ s best article on that week ’ s episode ? Sign up for our Season 8 newsletter here . ]
 Cersei spent so much time talking about her pregnancy , it started to seem unlikely . Dany spent so much time saying she couldn ’ t get pregnant , she started to seem pretty destined to get pregnant . Both would presumably be incest baby , because somehow we ’ ve all been tricked into obsessing over a big ol ’ incest story .
 Long one of the sharpest operator in this story , Tyrion ha made one bad decision after another since joining Team Targaryen . Is he just not cut out for revolutionary leadership ? Or is his apparent love for Dany clouding his judgment ? We saw him creeping outside Jon and Dany ’ s door a they consummated their affection . What problem could that lead to this season ?
 He finally left Cersei a the snow fell on King ’ s Landing , and the trailer showed him in Northern garb and promising to “ fight for the living. ” But he will almost certainly have another date with his sister before this thing is over . Will she sway him to return ? Or die by his ( golden ) hand ?
 Few people of note died last season , presumably to leave room for plenty of slaughter this time around . Everyone ’ s fate is up for grab .
 “ Game of Thrones ” is broadly about the evolution from a dynastic , tribal world defined by cycle of violence and revenge toward a more humanistic , cooperative one equipped to confront big existential challenge . So character who have themselves become more enlightened over the course of the story ( Jon , Sansa , maybe even Jaime ) seem safer than those still nursing old grudge ( Cersei , Arya , Dany ) .
 Dany tell everyone that she is not like her father , the Mad King . But she ’ s largely defined by her messianic streak , a quality that in it most extreme form can — much like Targaryens , we ’ re repeatedly reminded — go either way . And while she ha shown plenty of compassion ( freeing slave , forgiving Jorah ) , she responds to slight with often shocking cruelty ( crucifying master in Meereen , locking her handmaiden Doreah in the vault , torching the Tarlys ) .
 So considering the revelation awaiting her in Winterfell , this thing could be a powder keg .
 Now that the Night King and friend have breached the Wall , they would seem to be the more pressing concern . Jon , at least , is focused on the White Walkers and seems to have convinced Dany ’ s camp and Sansa to go along with this plan . Jaime seems to be on board , too .
 Also , all we ’ ve heard in the run-up to the final season is about the 55 night of shooting and the unprecedented scale of the White Walker clash , and according to HBO , the longest episode of the season is actually the third one . ( One hour , 22 minute ! )
 So maybe Night King first , then Cersei . Of course , a persistent theory ha the Night King being the one to win the whole thing , which is technically possible but seems too cynical for a story that , while dark and full of terror , seems to be generally about moving into the light .
 I believe it wa the maester Cleatus the Melancholy who first postulated in “ Ice Magick and Dragon Fyre ” that the heat generated by an adult dragon is honestly who in the seven hell could possibly know ? The clash should be fun to watch , at any rate , until dragon start dying ( or re-dying , in Viserion ’ s case ) . And then it will be sad , because the beast didn ’ t ask to be born into this cruel and stupid world .
 It ’ s right there in the title : This show is about a pan-global contest to win ultimate power .
 But is it really though ? Hasn ’ t everything we ’ ve learned over the past seven season — a this fevered pursuit ha inspired all manner of butchery and abuse , and destroyed family and relationship , and empowered sadist , and turned the most magnificent creature in the land into nuclear weapon and led at least one formerly decent man to literally burn his daughter alive ( I ’ ll never forgive you HBO ) — suggested that this contest is , in fact , irredeemably toxic ? Vegas will give you odds on the various contender ( we had our own fun with this ) . But are we really supposed to root for one of this story ’ s hero to eventually sit upon the symbol of all that is terrible ?
 Given this show ’ s defining knack for upending expectation , the long-promised battle for control of the kingdom seems sure to veer from the usual “ good guy meet bad guy , blow stuff up , suffer loss but prevail in the end ” script . Wouldn ’ t the ultimate swerve for “ Game of Thrones ” be to blow up the throne itself ?
 Maybe . Or maybe Jon and Dany will be the beloved king and queen , and Tyrion , Jaime and Arya will all get flower and medal a in the end of “ Star Wars ” or “ Lord of the Rings ” or any number of more conventional fantasy tale . Either way , game on .

 On Politics With Lisa Lerer
 By Lisa Lerer
 Hi . Welcome to On Politics , your guide to the day in national politics . I ’ m Lisa Lerer , your host .

 He kissed a senator ’ s wife on the lip . He joked about the attractiveness of several senator ’ teenage daughter and granddaughter . And he told a female senator to “ spread her leg ” because she wa “ going to be frisked . ”
 A # MeToo moment ?
 That ’ s not how it wa seen at the time . No , that wa just Joe Biden , hamming it up a he swore in the new senator . In his time a vice president , the ceremony became an annual spectacle in Washington , with his behavior even earning an affectionate nickname : “ Bidening . ”
 Those joke , hug and kiss may look different now . An essay published Friday night by Lucy Flores , a former Nevada legislator , that accuses Mr. Biden of leaning into her , smelling her hair and kissing her head in a way that made her uncomfortable at a 2014 campaign rally , ha thrust the possible presidential candidate into a major generational reckoning .
 [ A second woman came forward Monday and accused Mr. Biden of touching her in a way that made her feel uncomfortable . ]
 Mr. Biden entered the Senate in 1973 — before abortion wa legal , before the Watergate hearing , before VCRs , before the Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg wa born , and certainly before any serious national conversation about consent .
 Whether the 76-year-old Mr. Biden can get right with his party ’ s current more around race and gender may be the most fraught question hanging over his presidential aspiration .
 In the # MeToo era , we talk a lot about “ open secrets. ” But Mr. Biden ’ s touchy-feely behavior wasn ’ t a secret at all . It wa photographed , televised and widely discussed . And , for year , it wa viewed a a political asset . Mr. Biden wa a skilled retail politician , according to the conventional wisdom , someone who could work a room , charm a crowd , win them over booth by booth in a New Hampshire diner .
 This weekend ’ s accusation could transform that strength into a weakness .
 In response to Ms. Flores ’ s account , Mr. Biden said he didn ’ t believe he had ever acted inappropriately in public life but wa willing to “ listen respectfully ” to those who may feel differently . Ms. Flores flipped the frame , saying Mr. Biden ’ s perception didn ’ t matter : How his action made her feel wa more important . “ Frankly , my point wa never about his intention , and they shouldn ’ t be about his intention , ” she said in an interview with CNN . “ It should be about the woman on the receiving end of that behavior . ”
 Now , the political world find itself litigating a series of thorny question . Does intent matter ? Are we allowed to think that a back-of-head kiss is “ not a bad ” a a mouth kiss , even though they are both kind of gross ? Can a progressive male politician issue a denial , while still saying he belief woman ?
 The debate , which should come a no surprise to Mr. Biden or his team if they ’ ve been following the news over the past two year , will ultimately be decided by voter , should Mr. Biden jump into the race .
 Last month , Mr. Biden referred to himself a a “ tactile politician ” during a speech in Dover , Del. , arguing that the skill helped him understand voter . Whether he understands the political moment , though , remains an open question .

 It ’ s Election Day Eve in Wisconsin !
 The Supreme Court race on the ballot Tuesday won ’ t change the conservative majority on the state ’ s highest court . But it will tell u something about the political mood in a key battleground state that Democrats lost by a little more than 22,000 vote in 2016 and carried two year later .
 While Supreme Court race are technically nonpartisan affair , they ’ ve become heavily politicized event , with million of dollar pouring in from political group . In this year ’ s contest , conservative back Judge Brian Hagedorn and liberal are behind Judge Lisa Neubauer .
 The candidate faced off in a bitter debate last month that featured accusation of lying and question of temperament .
 A win by Judge Neubauer would leave liberal in a strong position to retake control of the court the next time a seat come up in 2020 , when Democrats typically benefit from the larger turnout of a presidential year . The court could face several big political decision , including question around the redistricting that will follow the 2020 census and determine the makeup of congressional district .
 Turnout for Supreme Court election is typically around 20 percent , le than half that of a race for governor . Still , political strategist will be watching to try to extrapolate trend about motivation , enthusiasm , and the energy of Democratic and Republican voter in the state . One area to pay attention to : suburban county outside Milwaukee that typically vote Republican but have shown some erosion during the Trump era .

 The actor Liam Neeson said in an interview with a British newspaper last month that he once spent a week walking the street with a club looking for a black man to kill after a woman close to him wa raped by someone she said wa black .
 “ She handled the situation of the rape in the most extraordinary way , ” Mr. Neeson said of the episode , which he said happened year ago . “ But my immediate reaction wa , did she know who it wa ? No . What color were they ? She said it wa a black person . ”
 “ I went up and down area with a cosh , hoping I ’ d be approached by somebody , ” the Northern Ireland-born Mr. Neeson said , using a British word that describes a clublike weapon . “ I ’ m ashamed to say that , and I did it for maybe a week — hoping some black bastard would come out of a pub and have a go at me about something , you know ? So that I could kill him . ”
 Mr. Neeson made the comment , which were published in The Independent on Monday with an audio recording of the interview , during a press event to promote his new film , “ Cold Pursuit. ” The remark were immediately met with public outrage .
 “ It ’ s unfortunate and sick that Liam Neeson would in response to a tragedy simply seek out any black person to murder , ” Malik Russell , a spokesman for the N.A.A.C.P. , said in an email . “ Pain suffered is not an excuse for racism . ”
 “ If black people responded this way regarding all the time our ancestor were lynched , raped , mutilated , tortured or shot down by police brutality , there would be too many body to count , ” Mr. Russell added . “ The fact that black people have been able to not blame every white person for the deed of racist white is a tribute to our character a a people . ”
 Mr. Neeson , 66 , responded to the outrage over his remark on Tuesday . In an interview on “ Good Morning America , ” he said he later felt awful about his “ primal urge ” to hurt someone after the woman told him she had been raped .
 “ If she would have said an Irish or a Scot or a Brit or a Lithuanian , I know I would have had the same effect , ” Mr. Neeson said on Tuesday . “ I wa trying to show honor to my — stand up for my dear friend in this terrible , medieval fashion . ”
 He said , “ I ’ m not a racist . ”
 Mr. Neeson said he sought help , eventually talking about the episode with his priest and friend . He also said he found an outlet to shed his violent thought by taking brisk two-hour walk every day . His friend died five year ago , he said .
 Mr. Neeson , who wa nominated for an Academy Award for his role in “ Schindler ’ s List , ” ha starred in a series of high-profile Hollywood movie , including “ Les Misérables , ” “ Love Actually , ” “ Michael Collins , ” “ Gangs of New York ” and “ Star Wars : Episode I . ”
 In addition to “ Cold Pursuit , ” which tell the story of a man who commits a series of revenge killing after the death of his son , he ha also appeared a a vengeful father in the “ Taken ” series , best known for his vow to use “ a particular set of skill ” on his daughter ’ s kidnapper .
 The film company Lionsgate , which is distributing his new film , did not respond on Monday to request for comment about his remark to The Independent .
 Representatives for Mr. Neeson ’ s co-star , Laura Dern and Tom Bateman , also did not respond to request for comment , though on the audio recording of the interview Mr. Bateman can be heard responding with a shocked expletive to Mr. Neeson ’ s remark .
 In the interview with The Independent , Mr. Neeson said he had never publicly talked about the episode before .
 “ It wa horrible , horrible , when I think back , that I did that , ” he said . “ And I ’ ve never admitted that , and I ’ m saying it to a journalist . God forbid . ”
 Mr. Neeson cast the episode a a parable on the pointlessness of seeking revenge and connected it back to the conflict in Northern Ireland , which officially ended in 1998 .
 “ It ’ s awful , but I did learn a lesson from it , ” he said . “ I understand that need for revenge , but it just lead to more revenge , to more killing and more killing . ”
 The author of the Independent article , Clémence Michallon , said on Twitter that the interview with Mr. Neeson and Mr. Bateman happened three week ago at a hotel in New York City .
 She said the story had gone through many round of editing and had been written “ a thousand different way . ”
 Ms. Michallon said at the start of the interview that Mr. Neeson pulled her recorder closer to him , “ indicating he ’ s been doing this for a while and know the peril of bad audio . ”
 She said that “ everything changed ” in the interview when she asked Mr. Neeson why his character in the film embarks on a series of revenge killing after his son dy . That is when Mr. Neeson shared the story , she said .
 At the end , she said , he “ politely ” asked her to be “ very careful ” if she included the anecdote in her article . He then jokingly slipped into the voice he used in the movie “ Taken , ” and told her if she were not , “ I will find you , ” she said .

 At the “ Captain Marvel ” premiere in Los Angeles last month , Brie Larson roamed the red carpet in a sequined Rodarte slip dress , a galaxy of diamond cradling her ear . A squadron of F-16 fighter jet flew overhead a fan cheered the movie ’ s star a she climbed step to a stage where she wa interviewed by Lorraine Cink .
 Ms. Cink , a self-described comic book geek and red carpet host , did not ask Ms. Larson about her gown a others did that day . Nor did she discus the movie ’ s internet troll or Ms. Larson ’ s call for more diversity in Hollywood . Instead she focused solely on Captain Marvel and her alter ego Carol Danvers , a United States Air Force pilot , played by Ms. Larson .
 “ Carol changed my life and this movie hasn ’ t even come out yet , ” Ms. Larson said , a she held back tear .
 Red carpet interview from the premiere were streamed live for fan who could not attend . And the show wa a slickly produced a any pre-awards festivity , albeit one that edged toward camp at time . ( For starter , Ms. Cink ’ s co-host interviewed a cat , one of several that played Goose in the movie . )
 Ms. Cink is an employee of Marvel Studios , which produced Captain Marvel . And if there is any question why the studio would air the red carpet live , consider this : The live stream ha been watched more than 485,000 time on YouTube alone .
 Fans today clamor for anything related to their favorite movie and television franchise . As a result , live-streaming from the red carpet is not just for the Oscars anymore . More studio are producing their own red carpet extravaganza , hiring battalion of brand-friendly host to market the studio ’ s offering and control social medium messaging . And with technology that make live-steaming easy , new player have joined the fray to take advantage of the summer blockbuster season and it worldwide audience .
 “ Movie premiere have become global moment , ” said Doug Neil , Universal Pictures executive vice president for digital marketing . “ Fans like to feel like they are part of the experience . ”
 Mr. Neil would know . Last year the studio held only one premiere in London for “ Mamma Mia ! Here We Go Again. ” With an army of Academy Award winner on the red carpet — including Meryl Streep , Colin Firth , Tom Hanks and Cher — the event would be difficult for Universal to reproduce elsewhere , he said . Premieres are expensive , too , sometimes costing $ 100,000 or more . So the festivity in London were live-streamed on Facebook , where they were viewed more than 451,000 time around the world .
 “ The talent bench wa so deep , ” Mr. Neil said of the celebrity who attended . “ And Facebook ha our largest community of fans. ” With streaming technology , he added , “ It ’ s very easy to flip a switch . ”
 The quality , though , can depend on whose hand is on the switch . “ When we started doing this , it wa iPhones on tripod , ” said Alison Hoffman , chief marketing officer for the cable channel Starz . Now , she said , the company team up with medium outlet , like Entertainment Weekly , People and Entertainment Tonight , to host live stream red carpet event . That wa the case last June at the premiere of “ Power ” at Radio City Music Hall in Manhattan . The channel broadcast a live stream with three video camera .
 “ For the right show , it ’ s a critical part of the mix , ” Ms. Hoffman said .
 That is not always the case , though . Last week , the cast of “ Game of Thrones ” gathered at Radio City Music Hall for the final red carpet premiere for the beloved HBO show . The spectacle wa broadcast live by NowThis , a social medium content company , which streamed unscripted , raw footage from the “ Game of Thrones ” press line . An HBO executive said the company wa neither involved in nor aware of the live stream , which explains why it had none of the polish of a typical HBO affair .
 Photographers could be heard booing when Sophie Turner , who play Sansa Stark , invited Joe Jonas , her pop star fiancé , to join her on the red carpet . “ How about a kiss ? ” a man shouted at Lisa Bonet , the wife of Jason Momoa , who delighted a the he-man Khal Drogo in Season 1 . Ms. Bonet shook her head no ; her husband wa visibly annoyed .
 The video itself wa sketchy , too . The camera shook and the Wi-Fi wa unreliable . Gwendoline Christie looked fetching in a flowing yellow gown until she waved her silken sleeve and the screen disappeared into a haze of pixelated square . Still , the live stream ha been watched more than 188,000 time on YouTube .
 “ It ’ s not always the best quality that get the most eyeball , ” said Tina Exarhos , the chief content officer of NowThis . “ When you are on a red carpet , these are the moment you look for . ”
 Despite the video ’ s raw quality , she added , “ We are looking to do more and more of these with studio . ”
 The Walt Disney Studios , which oversees Lucasfilm , Marvel Studios , Pixar and it own slate of movie , ha the most sophisticated live-streaming operation in Hollywood . Lylle Breier , who oversees premiere and special event for the studio , said there were often multiple host — some on stage , others on the red carpet — and several camera used for interview .
 The movie that attract the most attention are the “ Star Wars ” and Marvel franchise . Last April ’ s red carpet premiere for “ Avengers : Infinity War , ” for example , ha been watched 7.28 million time . There , Gwyneth Paltrow plugged her company , Goop . ( “ She did a Goop detox and she ’ s fine , ” she said of her stressed-out character , Pepper Potts . ) Ms. Paltrow also admitted to never having watched an “ Avengers ” movie .
 As many a 30 people are hired to produce a live-streamed red carpet show for a Disney company premiere . And host , like Ms. Cink , have job mostly because they are fan . “ They do not ask reporter-type question , ” Ms. Breier said .
 Ms. Cink ha hosted at least six streaming red carpet premiere and writes all her own question . She copped to being flustered by only one celebrity : Stan Lee , the force behind Marvel Comics . ( Mr. Lee died in November , and “ Captain Marvel ” carry a dedication to him , a well a a montage of his movie cameo in the Marvel logo . )
 Her background in improvisational theater is helpful , she said . Once her earpiece quit working during a live shot , which made it impossible to hear .
 “ I looked like a deer in the headlight , ” she said . “ I screamed my intro . I know I looked , like , cuckoo banana . And it wa completely live . I wa kicking off the whole show . ”

 Zhores I. Alferov , a Russian physicist who won a Nobel Prize for research that underpinned an array of invention integral to modern life , from solar cell to DVD player to cellphone , died Friday night in St. Petersburg . He wa 88 .
 The death , at a hospital , wa announced by Gennady Zyuganov , the leader of the Russian Communist Party , according to Tass , the Russian state news agency .
 Dr. Alferov shared the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physics with two American physicist , Herbert Kroemer and Jack S. Kilby , “ for basic work on information and communication technology . ”
 Son of a Stalinist industrial apparatchik , Dr. Alferov maintained an ambiguous relationship with the United States throughout his life . He worked closely with American colleague but rejected market reform in post-Soviet Russia and served in it parliament a a Communist Party deputy .
 He did his research at the Ioffe Institute in Leningrad ( today St. Petersburg ) , whose weightier project included helping to build the Soviet hydrogen bomb and nuclear submarine fleet .
 The three scientist who shared the 2000 prize , working separately , pioneered the development of the so-called heterostructure semiconductor . Scientists had studied semiconductor — material that conduct a relatively weak and controllable pulse of electricity — since the 1930s , famously focusing on silicon a the most useful . But the transit of electron through a silicon wafer , known a a homostructure because it consists of one material , proved ineffective at releasing photon , whose energy can be converted to light in the form of a laser beam .
 Dr. Alferov discovered that a “ sandwich ” of different material , or heterostructure , could yield a continuous stream of photon without adding so much electrical current that it would heat the material to extreme temperature .
 He hit upon the optimal combination of gallium arsenide with aluminum , and in 1968 made his first visit to the United States to deliver a paper summarizing his result . The presentation “ produced the impression of an exploded bomb , ” Dr. Alferov would recall without undue modesty in his Nobel acceptance speech 32 year later .
 His research also gave him entree to American colleague at Bell Labs and IBM , and set off a small-scale laser race that combined comradeship and sharing between individual scientist with dead-serious Cold War rivalry .
 Dr. Alferov would recall with pride that in the race to build a prototype of a laser that worked at room temperature , he and his team in Leningrad beat Bell Labs in New Jersey by a month . Subsequent perfection of heterostructure laser and heterotransistors based on combined material made possible today ’ s world of LED screen , optically read disk and the fiber-optic technology behind cellphone .
 Zhores Ivanovich Alferov wa born on March 15 , 1930 , in Vitebsk , in what is now Belarus , the painter Marc Chagall ’ s hometown . His father , Ivan Karpovich Alferov , wa a former dockworker who joined the Bolsheviks in 1917 and later regaled his two son with reminiscence of meeting Lenin and Trotsky .
 His mother , Anna Vladimirovna Alferov , headed a public organization of housewife , worked a a librarian “ and always remained our close friend while bringing u up without discouraging word , ” Dr. Alferov wrote in his Nobel autobiographical essay .
 Communism lifted his father to the role of itinerant industrial manager , and he moved the family across the Soviet Union a he helped carry out Stalin ’ s five-year plan for rapid industrialization and collectivization of agriculture . He named his eldest son , Marx , after Karl Marx ; Zhores wa named after the assassinated French Socialist leader Jean Jaurès .
 Marx wa 20 when he died at the front during World War II , to be remembered by his younger brother a half-century later at the Nobel ceremony in Stockholm .
 Zhores moved to Leningrad to study physic after the war . He joined the research institute there , founded by the father of the Soviet semiconductor field , Abram Ioffe , in 1953 , the year Stalin died .
 The time were turbulent but fertile for science , a both the United States and the Soviet Union poured money into research that each hoped would keep it ahead of the other in a superpower competition for supremacy .
 “ The sensation I felt then could not be compared to anything , ” Dr. Alferov wrote of his early work at Ioffe .
 He stuck with the institute all his life , winning the Lenin Prize , Soviet science ’ s highest honor , in 1972 ; becoming director of Ioffe in 1987 ; and heading the Leningrad-St. Petersburg branch of the Academy of Sciences in 1989 . In the mid-1990s , he wa obliged to accept support from his old rival in America . The United States Strategic Defense Initiative , better known a “ Star Wars , ” helped finance Ioffe and a half dozen other Russian research center for several year .
 “ You could tell it wa hard for him to be in this position , ” said Michael Stroscio , a University of Illinois professor of electrical and computer engineering who visited Ioffe to help oversee the Pentagon grant . “ He wa very professional , but kept his distance . ”
 Among his survivor is his wife , Tamara Darskaya ; their daughter , Olga ; and their son , Ivan . A first marriage had produced another daughter , but Dr. Alferov rarely spoke of the union .
 Dr. Alferov had entered politics reluctantly , he told interviewer , his purpose being to revive domestic financing for science . He joined Russia ’ s parliament , the State Duma , in 1995 a a member of the party supporting the westernizing policy of President Boris Yeltsin , but he switched to the opposition Communists in the 1999 parliamentary election , convinced that Mr. Yeltsin ’ s “ young reformer ” had brought Russia to the brink of economic ruin . ( Mr. Yeltsin stunned the world when he resigned le than two week later , turning over the presidency to the prime minister , Vladimir V . Putin . )
 Dr. Alferov served a a Communist deputy , but seldom attended Duma session and maintained his focus on bill affecting science and technology .
 “ He probably lost a bit of prestige among the intelligentsia for joining the Communists , ” said Yuri Korgonyuk , a commentator at the Moscow political think tank Indem . “ But everyone could see he wasn ’ t really a politician . ”
 Faith in science and it universal benefit remained Dr. Alferov ’ s true credo . “ All that wa made by human being , in principle , wa made due to science , ” he said after accepting the Nobel Prize .
 An earlier version of this obituary referred incorrectly to Michael Stroscio . He is a University of Illinois professor of electrical and computer engineering , not physic .

 BLACK LEOPARD , RED WOLF By Marlon James
 The story kernel at the center of “ Black Leopard , Red Wolf , ” Marlon James ’ s surreal new fantasy epic , concern the search for a missing boy . A hunter named Tracker , who is famous for his nose — “ for finding what would rather stay lost ” — is hired to find the lost child , who may or may not be the rightful heir to the throne of an ancient African empire . Tracker soon realizes that he is only one of many hired to find the boy — or proof of his death .
 The search for the boy , it turn out , is a giant MacGuffin : The very first sentence of the novel informs u that the child is dead , and James us the search a an armature on which to hang dozen of other tale , much the way he used the story of an assassination attempt on Bob Marley in his award-winning 2014 novel “ A Brief History of Seven Killings ” a scaffolding to create a tangled , choral portrait of Jamaica and it relationship with the United States .
 In these page , James conjures the literary equivalent of a Marvel Comics universe — filled with dizzying , magpie reference to old movie and recent TV , ancient myth and classic comic book , and fused into something new and startling by his gift for language and sheer inventiveness .
 The fictional Africa in “ Black Leopard , Red Wolf ” feel like a place mapped by Gabriel García Márquez and Hieronymus Bosch with an assist from Salvador Dalí . It ’ s a magical , sometimes beautiful place , but also a place filled with malicious vampire , demon , witch and necromancer , given to murder , cannibalism and the hurling of evil spell . The action is often gut-wrenchingly violent — part “ Blood Meridian , ” part “ Deadpool , ” part “ Game of Thrones. ” Innocents are slaughtered in showdown between rival group . Curses and dark prophecy multiply . Hearts and eyeball are bloodily plucked out .
 Metamorphosis — of the sort made famous by both Ovid and Stan Lee — is one of the novel ’ s central theme . There ’ s Tracker ’ s passage into manhood through a series of harrowing adventure ; and his love-hate relationship with the Leopard , a charismatic being who can incarnate himself a both an animal and a man . Tracker also ha a series of alarming encounter with shape-shifting creature who may be adversary or ally or both — including Sasabonsam , a menacing batlike creature who may have kidnapped the missing boy ; and Nyka , a mercenary and former friend who once committed a terrible act of betrayal .
 [ Marlon James list his 10 desert-island book . ]
 How did these character reach these particular crossroad ? Whom can Tracker trust , and can the reader trust Tracker — or is he a unreliable a narrator a the rival and relative who offer conflicting story line , suggesting that truth is “ a shifting , slithering thing ” ? Is his father really his grandfather , a his uncle asserts ? Will he avenge himself on the men who killed his brother and father ? Will his love for a group of orphaned , misfit child replace the anger in his heart and give him a sense of purpose ? Why doe Tracker hide his real feeling about the Leopard ? And why doe the Leopard tell him to “ learn not to need people ” ? Such question are not entirely answered in this volume — which is only the first installment of what James is calling his “ Dark Star ” trilogy .
 In keeping with familiar fantasy and sci-fi template ( from Harry Potter to “ The Matrix ” to “ The Lion King ” ) , the plot of “ Black Leopard , Red Wolf ” retraces many of the step that the scholar Joseph Campbell described a stage in the archetypal hero ’ s journey . Like Luke Skywalker in “ Star Wars ” and Frodo in “ The Lord of the Rings , ” Tracker set off on a journey that will take him away from home — to distant land and kingdom , where he face a series of dangerous test . And like many a comic-book superhero and antihero before him , Tracker grapple painfully with his own identity , even a he fight off a succession of opponent who threaten to thwart his mission . Along the way , a his path converges with that of others looking for the missing boy , Tracker becomes part of a motley group of mercenary and misfit who squabble noisily and violently among themselves — and who bear more than a passing resemblance to the sort of ragtag team of rival assembled in movie like “ The Dirty Dozen , ” “ The Avengers ” and “ Guardians of the Galaxy . ”
 There are allusion in “ Black Leopard , Red Wolf ” not just to countless Marvel series and character ( like the Black Panther , Deadpool and Wolverine ) , but also to myriad literary work including Octavia E. Butler ’ s sci-fi classic “ Wild Seed , ” Angela Carter ’ s “ The Bloody Chamber , ” Salman Rushdie ’ s “ The Satanic Verses , ” Tolkien ’ s Middle-earth novel , Ursula K. Le Guin ’ s Earthsea book , Jung ’ s writing on archetype and the collective unconscious and African epic about trickster and shape-shifting character who symbolize chaos and change .
 James is such a nimble and fluent writer that such reference never threaten to devolve into pretentious postmodern exercise . Even when he is nestling one tale within another like Russian doll that underscore the provisional nature of storytelling ( and the Rashomon-like way in which we remember ) , he is giving u a gripping , action-packed narrative . What the novel could have used is a little judicious pruning : As in superhero movie , the action sometimes assumes a predictable , episodic rhythm — one violent , bravura showdown after another , strung together by interlude of travel and effort to regroup and connect the dot .
 What propels the novel forward is the same thing that fuel the best superhero movie and comic book : the origin story of it central character . We read to find out how Tracker became the Red Wolf and how the Leopard became the Leopard . In their beginning are their end : the key to their strength and vulnerability , the source of their drive and ambition and fear , and clue to the larger goal that endow their quest for self-knowledge with some larger sense of mission .
 With Tracker and the Leopard , James ha created two compelling and iconic character — character who will take their place in the pantheon of memorable and fantastical superheroes .

 As the fantasy saga head for the explosive finale it ha promised , I ’ m hoping for a little more conversation and a little le action .
 By James Poniewozik
 In “ The Dragon and the Wolf , ” the most recent season finale of “ Game of Thrones , ” a lot of people have a lot to talk about .
 The warring faction of Westeros have convened a truce to discus the frosty-cold undead army of the White Walkers approaching from the north . It reunites character with deep history who have been separated for age : Brienne ( Gwendoline Christie ) and the Hound ( Rory McCann ) ; the Hound and the Mountain ( Hafthor Julius Bjornsson ) ; Tyrion ( Peter Dinklage ) and Bronn ( Jerome Flynn ) ; Tyrion and Cersei ( Lena Headey ) .
 [ Read our complete guide to “ Game of Thrones ” and sign up for our newsletter . ]
 Friendships are reaffirmed ; old grievance are reopened ; negotiation are broached . But then : silence . No one ha anything left to say . They ’ re just waiting for the dragon to arrive .
 They do arrive , of course : two of them , enormous and leathery , one bearing the Khaleesi , Daenerys Targaryen ( Emilia Clarke ) , descend screeching and preening . It ’ s showtime !
 The scene encapsulates what “ Game of Thrones ” ha become , a it begin it last fire-belching spin around the HBO firmament Sunday : a dragon-delivery device , a collection of spectacular image , to which character , complexity and conversation have become secondary .
 The series ’ s change , in part , reflect the ambition and limitation of today ’ s big-ticket TV . Rewatch the earliest episode , from 2011 , and they already seem to belong to another era .
 It ’ s not simply that Arya ( Maisie Williams ) wa more innocent then , Westeros more peaceful , Ned Stark ’ s head still attached to his body . ( No spoiler alert ! Honestly , you ’ ve had plenty of time . )
 [ This executive producer is a behind-the-scenes “ Game of Thrones ” star . ]
 It ’ s how much of the series wa simply people talking , how it wa able to draw import from relatively small incident . The second episode , “ The Kingsroad , ” for instance , focus it main story line on nothing more high-stakes than the death of a child ’ s pet .
 The Starks , journeying to the capital where Ned ( Sean Bean ) will serve King Robert ( Mark Addy ) , have recently come into possession of a litter of orphan direwolves . Along the way , the crown prince , Joffrey ( Jack Gleeson ) , bully Arya ’ s friend , the butcher boy ’ s son , holding him at sword point . Arya ’ s wolf , Nymeria , maul Joffrey ( no jury would convict her ) . After Arya scare Nymeria off , Ned is forced to execute Lady , the wolf belonging to his daughter Sansa ( Sophie Turner ) , in her stead , to keep peace between the family .
 That ’ s it . Roll credit . No magic , no dragonfire . But so much character and foreshadowing are concentrated in this high-fantasy “ Old Yeller. ” It establishes , in one sword-stroke , that Robert , pushed by Cersei and his bratty son , is weak and inconstant ; that the Stark child will become unmoored from their root ( the direwolf is the symbol of the North , and this is the first of several lupicides to come ) ; that Joffrey is a dangerous monster ; that the Starks will pay a high cost , principle will be tested and the innocent will die .
 Compare this with “ The Battle of the Bastards ” in Season 6 , where Jon Snow ( Kit Harington ) see his adoptive brother Rickon ( Art Parkinson ) murdered before his eye . The moment barely ha time to land . If viewer remember it at all , it ’ s a the opening casualty for the breathtaking war scene , which took nearly two month to shoot , that give the episode it title .
 To be fair , the George R.R . Martin book on which the series is based establish a premise in which the mythic and epic will become more commonplace . “ Game of Thrones ” is about a world in which magic used to exist , seemed to disappear and is slowly returning . This happens gradually , then accelerates . The dragon take a season to hatch , then they grow up fast ; war break out , then it engulfs the world .
 In the saga ’ s best season — roughly the middle of it run — the showrunners David Benioff and D.B . Weiss held it human and fantastical side in balance . It managed stunning set piece — the Battle of the Blackwater , the Red Wedding — but it wa grounded in idea .
 It ’ s become cliché , for instance , to compare current politics to “ Thrones , ” but that ’ s in part because the series engaged so deeply with the question of what it mean to be a good leader . Now it ’ s become more of a pure power exercise , cutting through those Gordian knot of subtlety with Valyrian steel .
 The recent 20th anniversary of “ The Sopranos ” reminded u of a tension that series always had , between it creator , David Chase , who insisted that relationship were a important to the series a the mob war , and his more bloodthirsty fan , who wanted , a the phrase went , “ Less yakking , more whacking . ”
 “ Game of Thrones ” ha had that tension itself over the year . But unlike Chase , who stubbornly stuck to his vision , “ Thrones ” ha increasingly given into the fan contingent that want more big action moment . Less blabbing , more stabbing !
 In a way , the evolution of “ Game of Thrones ” over the season show how it bridged the distance between two era of TV . It began , in 2011 , in the wake of HBO ’ s “ Sopranos ” era , which took familiar genre ( the gangster saga , the cop show , the Western ) and set them in world of moral grayness and complexity .
 “ Thrones ” felt like the natural extension of that approach , a realpolitik fractured fairy tale in which good and bad were harder to distinguish than they were among Tolkien ’ s orcs and elf . “ The Kingsroad ” is like the first-season “ Sopranos ” episode “ College , ” in which Tony offs a mafia rat while on a road trip with his daughter — a small , definitional story that tell you you ’ re watching something familiar , but different .
 But over time , “ Thrones ” evolved into an example of the next age of TV drama , defined by hit action spectacle like “ The Walking Dead ” and especially the binge model of Netflix , in which TV series were structured le like collection of episode than unitary , sprawling megastories where one hour just bleeds into the next .
 This is what “ Game of Thrones ” became . With a few exception , it wa memorable more for visually stunning or shocking scene than for well-constructed episode . People describe it signature moment like “ Friends ” title : “ The One Where the Mountain Smooshes the Viper ” ; “ The One Where Danaerys Says , ‘ Dracarys ’ ” ; “ The One With the Ice Dragon . ”
 Yet the scene that stick with me from “ Game of Thrones ” are almost invariably conversation . Robert and Cersei talking with resigned familiarity about their marriage . Arya and Tywin ( Charles Dance ) discussing legacy and power . Any scene involving Olenna Tyrell ( Diana Rigg ) and her thorny tongue . The Hound ordering the chicken .
 These moment have become rarer a the series ha gone beyond the plot of the uncompleted book and it pace ha accelerated ( sometimes , to be fair , improving on sluggish source material ) . And I have to wonder if the turn toward spectacle stem from Benioff and Weiss ’ s much-stated belief that they ’ re making a “ 73-hour movie. ” By that analogy , their blockbuster series is obligated to provide an extended , explosive third act .
 “ Game of Thrones ” ha indeed produced the kind of awe-inspiring , culture-dominating entertainment you used to have to see in a theater . If HBO-age TV were 1970s Hollywood , it would be the “ Star Wars ” to Tony Soprano ’ s “ Godfather . ”
 It isn ’ t really a movie , though , and that ’ s for the best . Unlike a movie , a TV series is able to course-correct and learn a it go , a “ Thrones ” did by finally cutting back on it egregious rape scene .
 My hope — because , make no mistake , I will be eagerly planted in front of the series from Sunday until my watch is ended — is that “ Game of Thrones ” will likewise use it final run to rediscover it root a a series not just about dragon but also about people making difficult choice in extremis , a show that can give you chill even a it breathes fire .

 High-tech surgical robot aren ’ t an improvement over traditional operation , the F.D.A . warns . For some patient , the robot may be worse .
 By Roni Caryn Rabin
 Robotic surgery wa never approved for mastectomy or any other cancer-related treatment , but that ha hardly deterred doctor in the operating suite . The equipment is widely used to operate on patient with various malignancy , from breast cancer to prostate cancer .
 Yet there have long been question about how well doctor are trained on the machine , and whether the device are better for patient than traditional method .
 Now the Food and Drug Administration ha warned that there is no evidence cancer patient receiving robotic procedure live longer than those who have traditional procedure . And some research show that patient with cervical cancer fare worse .
 “ We want doctor and patient to be aware of the lack of evidence of safety and effectiveness for these us so they can make better informed decision about their cancer treatment and care , ” said Dr. Terri Cornelison , assistant director for the health of woman at the F.D.A. ’ s Center for Devices and Radiological Health .
 [ Like the Science Times page on Facebook . | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter . ]
 Robotic system have been on the market for more than 15 year , and have been used for cancer surgery for much of that time . The machine ’ s tower , which is positioned over the patient , look a bit like a multi-armed Star Wars droid . Three of it arm hold surgical device , while a fourth hold a camera .
 The robot ’ s arm are controlled by a computer that replicates the movement of the operating surgeon , who manipulates the robot ’ s control while looking at a monitor that provides a magnified , high-definition image of the operating site .
 The F.D.A . noted the finding of two study published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine .
 One of them wa a clinical trial that wa stopped early after investigator found that woman with cervical cancer who had so-called minimally invasive hysterectomy , including robotically assisted procedure , experienced four time a many cancer recurrence and six time a many death , compared with patient who had the more traditional procedure .
 The trial ’ s finding were especially striking because the surgery , a radical hysterectomy , usually cure patient with cervical cancer , said Dr. Pedro T. Ramirez , lead author of the paper and director of minimally invasive surgical research at M.D . Anderson Cancer Center in Houston .
 A second study funded by the National Institutes of Health used a database to compare the outcome of 2,461 woman with cervical cancer who had different type of surgery . Four year after the operation , 9.1 percent of those who had minimally invasive surgery had died , compared with 5.3 percent of those who had open surgery .
 Yet many physician continue to recommend robotic surgery to patient , despite the evidence of harm . “ Several surgeon have said to me , ‘ I can ’ t find a flaw in your study , but I just can ’ t stop doing it , ’ ” Dr. Ramirez said .
 Dr. Ramirez ’ s own department stopped doing minimally invasive radical hysterectomy in October 2017 , when the first study ’ s result were confirmed .
 “ My feeling is , this is about patient care , ” he said . “ It ’ s not about how much time you devoted to your training or your ego . It ’ s an issue of cancer , and having a high likelihood of cancer coming back if you have surgery through this approach . ”
 It is not clear why cervical cancer outcome were worse following minimally invasive surgery . Dr. Ramirez suggested that the instrument used to manipulate the cervix and uterus may cause cancer cell to spread .
 Another possibility is that the carbon dioxide pumped into the abdomen during robotic and other minimally invasive procedure — it provides working and viewing space for the surgeon — may increase the likelihood of cancer cell implanting , Dr. Ramirez said .
 The F.D.A. ’ s warning wa not limited to cervical cancer : Robotic surgical device are not authorized for prevention or treatment of any cancer , nor are they approved for mastectomy ( removal of the breast ) , the agency said .
 The agency also urged health care provider “ to complete the appropriate training ” needed for performing robotic surgery , and urged patient to ask doctor about their training and experience , a well a about their patient ’ outcome .
 In 2000 , the F.D.A . allowed the sale of one of the first robotic surgery system , the da Vinci Surgical System , under a process called “ premarket notification , ” which is often used to bring medical device on to the market without the rigorous safety and efficacy trial required for new drug .
 Under premarket notification , device are “ cleared ” for use on the ground that they are similar to device already available . The da Vinci system is cleared for some urological and gynecological procedure , among others .
 A similar robotic device , the Senhance Surgical System , wa approved for gynecological and colorectal surgery , among other procedure .
 But the efficacy of either system for cancer treatment ha not been evaluated by the F.D.A . And none of the system have been cleared for mastectomy , or removal of the breast , which ha become a frequent use .
 The F.D.A. ’ s approval wa “ based on evaluation of the device a a surgical tool and did not include evaluation of outcome related to the treatment of cancer , ” the agency said . The F.D.A . reviewed short-term data on outcome , a spokeswoman said , not the long-term data important to cancer patient .
 So why are these machine allowed in cancer surgery at all ? According to a spokeswoman , the F.D.A . doe not regulate the practice of medicine .
 “ If a medical provider determines it ’ s appropriate to use a product off-label , we don ’ t regulate that , ” she said . “ However , in this case , we were concerned about scientific journal and medium report referring to off-label us . ”
 Many surgeon tout the benefit of robotic surgery , with it smaller incision , saying the procedure bring shorter recovery time , le pain or blood loss and fewer scar and infection .
 Those are important measure , said Dr. Ramirez . But “ if you tell a patient you may stay in the hospital one or two day longer versus going home the same day , but there is a higher likelihood your cancer is going to come back , what are you going to choose a a patient ? Of course , you ’ ll stay in the hospital . ”
 Proposals to conduct another clinical trial to test the cervical cancer outcome would be unethical , Dr. Ramirez said , because result from the first study were clear .
 Physicians who continue to use robotic and minimally invasive approach for cancer treatment “ in the face of the evidence may put themselves in legal jeopardy , ” said Dr. Michael Carome , director of the health research group at Public Citizen , a consumer advocacy organization .
 Patients may not have been the only one caught off guard by the F.D.A. ’ s warning . Officials at Intuitive Surgical , maker of the da Vinci robotic system , believed their device wa cleared for radical hysterectomy and removal of the prostate . The latter would only be done to treat cancer .
 “ We have reached out to the F.D.A . for clarification , ” said Peper Long , a company spokeswoman .

 Alan R. Pearlman , the engineer who founded the synthesizer company ARP Instruments and designed it pioneering equipment , died on Jan. 5 in Newton , Mass . He wa 93 .
 His death wa confirmed by his daughter , Dina Pearlman .
 ARP ’ s analog synthesizer — particularly the compact , portable ARP Odyssey , introduced in 1972 — grew ubiquitous in pop and electronic music . By the mid-1970s , ARP wa the leading synthesizer manufacturer , commanding 40 percent of the market and outselling it predecessor and competitor , Moog and Buchla .
 ARP sound were central to numerous song , including Edgar Winter ’ s “ Frankenstein , ” Herbie Hancock ’ s “ Chameleon , ” Kraftwerk ’ s “ The Robots , ” Underworld ’ s “ Rez , ” Nine Inch Nails ’ “ The Hand That Feeds ” and the early-1980s version of the theme to the television series “ Doctor Who . ”
 The five-note signature motif of “ Close Encounters of the Third Kind ” wa played on an ARP 2500 synthesizer , which is seen in the film . An ARP 2600 , mixed with natural sound , provided the voice of R2-D2 in the first “ Star Wars ” movie .
 Alan Robert Pearlman wa born on June 7 , 1925 , in Manhattan and grew up in Bridgeport and Milford , Conn. His father , Julius , designed projector for movie theater . His mother , Ada ( Jacobs ) Pearlman , wa a homemaker .
 Mr. Pearlman , whose childhood nickname wa Arp , liked to describe himself a being a nerd “ before the term wa invented , ” according to “ Analog Days ” ( 2002 ) , a history of synthesizer by Trevor Pinch and Frank Trocco . Mr. Pearlman wa devoted to engineering and research , not corporate development or the pop music business ; he amassed more than 20 patent .
 Edgar Winter at the ARP 2600 in his home studio in Connecticut in the mid-1970s . ARP sound were central to his 1973 hit , “ Frankenstein . ”
 “ My father wa not a fame seeker ; he wa humble almost to a fault , ” Dina Pearlman said in a telephone interview . “ If he put his mind to something and he knew there wa a better solution , he found it . ”
 Growing up , Mr. Pearlman took piano lesson and built ham radio set . He served briefly in the Army at the end of World War II . He studied engineering at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts , where his senior thesis project , in 1948 , involved electronic music . It wa a vacuum-tube envelope follower , which could sense the “ envelope ” — the attack , volume , sustain and decay shaped by a musician — of a note played on an instrument .
 “ With greater attention on the part of the engineer to the need of the musician , ” Mr. Pearlman wrote in the accompanying paper , “ the day may not be too remote when the electronic instrument may take it place a “ a versatile , powerful and expressive instrument . ”
 Mr. Pearlman , who lived in Newton , married Buena Alcalay in 1958 . She and his daughter survive him .
 Mr. Pearlman worked for NASA designing amplifier for Gemini and Apollo spacecraft , then helped found Nexus Research Laboratory , which built precision solid-state analog module , including operational amplifier .
 Nexus wa sold to Teledyne in 1967 , the year Morton Subotnick ’ s “ Silver Apples of the Moon , ” an album-length electronic composition made on a Buchla synthesizer , wa released . Mr. Pearlman wa impressed , and in 1968 , after hearing “ Switched-On Bach ” by Wendy ( known at the time a Walter ) Carlos — a hit album of Bach piece recorded on a Moog via overdubbing and editing — he decided to work again on electronic instrument .
 “ I went into the basement and did some playing around , ” Mr. Pearlman told Inc. magazine in 1982 .
 Mr. Pearlman founded ARP , initially named Tonus Inc. , in 1969 . Early synthesizer tended to go rapidly out of tune . Mr. Pearlman solved that problem by placing two function on the same chip , and that stability became a major selling point .
 The company ’ s first instrument wa the ARP 2500 , a large console-size synthesizer introduced in 1970 ; it wa acquired by many university for electronic-music laboratory . The 2500 used a matrix of switch to connect it module instead of patch cord , which the Moog used . The slightly le bulky ARP 2600 , using patch cord but also including built-in preset connection , arrived in 1971 . Like other early synthesizer , they were monophonic , playing just one note at a time .
 The ARP Odyssey wa duophonic ( able to play two note at once ) , far more portable and easily comprehensible to synthesizer neophyte . It caught on rapidly among musician .
 Other ARP model followed : the even smaller Pro-Soloist , with preset sound ; the String Ensemble ; and the polyphonic Omni , which became the company ’ s best seller . At it peak , in 1977 , ARP ’ s annual sale were $ 7 million , the equivalent of about $ 29 million today .
 But against Mr. Pearlman ’ s wish , ARP ’ s other top management turned the company ’ s resource away from keyboard to develop the Avatar guitar synthesizer , a commercial failure . ARP went bankrupt in 1981 , costing stockholder and creditor $ 4 million ; Mr. Pearlman and his family lost $ 500,000 .
 The last product developed by ARP , the Chroma velocity-sensitive polyphonic synthesizer , wa sold to CBS Musical Instruments and became profitable there .
 Mr. Pearlman went on to start a computer-graphics company , Selva Systems , and later worked for Mini-Systems , a component manufacturer . In the 1980s he worked for a time with Ray Kurzweil , whose Kurzweil Music Systems wa developing new instrument . In recent year , Mr. Pearlman had grown concerned with global warming and wa designing improved technology for wind power .
 Meanwhile , musician clung to vintage ARP instrument . In the digital era , software programmer strove to emulate ARP ’ s sound and interface . Mr. Pearlman wa a consultant on the TimewARP 2600 , a software version of the ARP 2600 . In 2015 , the Japanese instrument company Korg revived ARP ’ s trademark and made an updated ARP Odyssey in both physical and software version .
 Mr. Pearlman maintained a lifelong interest in music . On Jan. 6 , his daughter posted on Facebook , “ At 93 , too weak to speak , he still managed to play the piano this morning , later passing away peacefully in the afternoon . ”

 LAUREL , Md . — A couple of day before the New Horizons spacecraft made it flyby of a small , icy world far beyond Pluto , scientist working on the mission finally got a picture of the body , nicknamed Ultima Thule , that wa more than a single dot . It looked a bit elongated , but that wa really all that could be detected from the image .
 “ I ’ ve never seen so many people so excited about two pixel , ” said S. Alan Stern , the principal investigator of the mission , during a news conference on Monday .
 Two day later , the scientist unveiled image from the flyby with some 28,000 pixel . They could finally make out some meaningful detail , which could eventually advance scientific understanding of the solar system ’ s earliest day .
 The New Horizons team will have to wait 20 month for all of the spacecraft ’ s data and image to return to Earth , but here is what they ’ ve learned so far .
 [ Sign up to get reminder for space and astronomy event on your calendar . ]
 Ultima Thule , known also by it official designation of 2014 MU69 , turn out to be what planetary scientist call a “ contact binary ” — two body that formed separately and then gently touched and stuck together . It ’ s a bit more than 21 mile long . To label the two part , the scientist named the larger one Ultima and the smaller one Thule .
 The New Horizons scientist described it a a snowman , but people on Twitter noticed a resemblance to a robot character from recent Star Wars movie .
 At Thursday ’ s news conference , scientist released stereo image of the asteroid giving a somewhat better sense of this shape . Brian May , the astrophysicist who wa also the lead guitarist of the rock band Queen , made one of these image . On Friday , Dr. Stern tweeted a video showing how the New Horizons team expressed their appreciation for Dr. May ’ s work .
 Planetary scientist are intrigued by the region known a the Kuiper belt — the home of Ultima Thule and other object — because it is perhaps the only place where some of the solar system ’ s earliest building block are preserved .
 The lack of sharp corner and apparently smooth surface of Ultima Thule suggests that it ha not changed much in the last 4.5 billion year . What the scientist find there could tell them a lot about how the sun and planet formed .
 Color measurement confirm that Ultima Thule is reddish like many object in the outer solar system . Indeed , in hue , it is an unremarkable member of what astronomer call cold classical , which all seem to have remained pristine and undisturbed since they formed .
 “ It display an average color that fall well within the average color displayed by the cold classical Kuiper belt object , ” said Silvia Protopapa , a member of the science team , said during a news conference on Thursday .
 The two lobe , Ultima and Thule , are the same shade of red , suggesting that they formed near each other before merging . The “ neck ” where the lobe connect is brighter and le red , which could indicate bit of debris that slid down the slope .
 In the past five month , a New Horizons approached Ultima Thule , the spacecraft looked for rhythmic variation in the brightness that would reveals how fast the body wa rotating . However , the brightness seemed to remain steady .
 They now know that the spacecraft is roughly looking down at one of Ultima Thule ’ s pole , so that it is mostly the same side of the body that wa always facing the spacecraft .
 With the world ’ s two lobe now visible , the mission ’ s scientist can finally calculate a rotation rate : once every 15 hour , give or take an hour .
 Scientists have not spotted any crater yet , but that doe not mean there are none . In the image seen so far , the sun is behind the spacecraft and thus shadow would not be visible , hiding the topography . Higher resolution image should be more revealing .
 In addition , crater might not look like crater because of the low density of Ultima Thule and the slow speed of collision in the Kuiper belt .
 “ It ’ s almost like styrofoam ball running into each other at low velocity , ” said Richard P. Binzel , a New Horizons science team member . “ You don ’ t so much make crater a dent . ”
 Also not seen yet are any moon or ring . The researcher are also looking for an atmosphere , although they do not expect to find one .
 NASA ’ s New Horizons spacecraft flew past the most distant object ever visited .
 The prediction of New Horizons ’ closest approach to Ultima Thule wa off by only 2 second . By contrast , for the spacecraft ’ s flyby of Pluto in 2015 , the prediction wa off by about 80 second . Even though Ultima Thule is smaller and farther away , the navigator were able to plot a more precise course this time , because in 2017 and 2018 , astronomer on the mission team were able to pin down Ultima Thule ’ s location by observing the object passing in front of a few distant star .
 At closest approach , at two second after 12:33 a.m. , New Horizons wa just under 2,200 mile from Ultima Thule , traveling at 32,290 mile per hour .
 New Horizons ha completed it study of Ultima Thule .
 As the spacecraft return it data , there is great interest in the highest resolution image taken right around the time of closest approach .
 Given how precisely the spacecraft seems to have performed , Dr. Stern said he wa “ guardedly optimistic ” that Ultima Thule will be in some of those image .
 The spacecraft ha also resumed measurement of dust , gas and radiation in the Kuiper belt , which could help scientist understand the process that turn material red in the Kuiper belt . New Horizons will also make long-distance image of other small world there to compare with Ultima Thule .
 Kenneth Chang ha been at The Times since 2000 , writing about physic , geology , chemistry , and the planet . Before becoming a science writer , he wa a graduate student whose research involved the control of chaos . @ kchangnyt

 In today ’ s age of the selfie and self-care , it seems only fitting that the watch industry would do some reflecting of it own : Several fashion savvy watch brand are creating timepiece with mirror dial .
 “ A mirrored surface is a reflection of the contemporary woman and our modern time , ” said Carolina Bucci , the London-based jeweler who ha been collaborating with the watchmaker Audemars Piguet . “ We live in a world where we are attached to our phone the whole time , taking picture , reflecting our world and bouncing it off to everyone else. ” In 2016 , Ms. Bucci shook up the cult classic Royal Oak , creating a limited edition with a bejeweled frosted finish in either white or rose gold .
 Now , she ha introduced yellow gold — and a mirror dial . “ I wanted a complete contrast , with a perfectly slick dial , ” Ms. Bucci said .
 The idea wasn ’ t an immediate hit with Audemars Piguet . The Royal Oak , created in 1972 by the legendary designer Gérald Genta , feature a dial with a tapisserie , or geometric pattern , motif — a signature detail that Ms. Bucci wanted to turn into a reflective surface . When the watchmaker resisted , Ms. Bucci quoted the brand ’ s own tagline to executive .
 “ I almost felt like I put a mirror in front of them , saying , ‘ Your motto is : To break the rule , you must first master them , ’ ” Ms. Bucci recalled .
 To be fair , she added , the new dial style wa a technical nightmare .
 “ There is no room for mistake — not a speck of dust , not a fingerprint , ” she said . “ Once you put the crystal on , it ’ s trapped in there forever . ”
 Also , it ’ s an actual mirror and not just a highly polished surface .
 “ To ram it home , I brought in my Ray-Ban sunglass and said , ‘ I want this kind of mirror , ’ ” Ms. Bucci said . “ I really need to use it to check I don ’ t have spinach in my teeth . ”
 The result wa a 37-millimeter model priced at $ 53,600 and limited to 300 piece . The dial seems to take on a life of it own , depending on the surface it is reflecting — it can look black , blue or even gold . It echo a current jewelry trend for transformable piece , a well a Ms. Bucci ’ s own approach : “ The last thing I want — for jewelry , watch , clothes , anything — is to get bored . ”
 A mirror dial may have a contemporary , on-trend look — consider the Apple Watch , with it reflective , black-screen face — but the idea is certainly not new . In the 1960s , the Danish silversmith Georg Jensen collaborated with the unconventional Swedish designer Vivianna Torun Bulow-Hube , known a Torun , who dreamed up a super simple watch with a mirror dial .
 The Vivianna , in fact , wa conceived a part of a competition : Design something you despise . Ms. Torun “ hated everything about time — the convention of keeping time and being a slave to it , ” said Nicholas Manville , Georg Jensen ’ s senior vice president of design . A mirror-faced watch wa a reminder not give in to the rigidity of timekeeping , Mr. Manville said : “ Whenever you thought about time , you saw yourself . ”
 Today , the Vivianna watch — a sculptural slip-on bangle of a timepiece — ha had several iteration and remains a best seller for the house .
 Over at Chanel , shiny surface are de rigueur , with the Parisian house taking it cue from the famous Art Deco mirrored staircase ( the backdrop of many of Coco Chanel ’ s fashion show ) in it headquarters at 31 , rue Cambon .
 Chanel , a with Carolina Bucci , is using mirror to inject modern cool into it watch . Last year , the Première — a wraparound chain bracelet watch created in 1987 a Chanel ’ s first watch exclusively for woman — wa given a golden mirror-dial treatment . The limited edition had 1,000 piece , each at $ 4,600 .
 But that wasn ’ t it first venture into reflection : In 2016 , Chanel ’ s signature J12 also got a mirror makeover in white ceramic and steel .
 For Mickey Mouse ’ s 90th birthday in November , Swatch collaborated with the celebrated British artist Damien Hirst on a reflective dial , with America ’ s most famous mouse rendered in a minimalist dot design ( $ 125 and limited to 19,999 piece , now sold out ) . And at Chaumet , a mirrored dial is an especially sleek addition to the Hortensia Eden collection of steel cocktail watch , which ha asymmetrically placed , hand-sculpted flower decorating the dial and a flat mesh Milanese bracelet ( 4,310 pound , or $ 5,515 ) .
 The futuristic feel of mirror dial had an attraction for the London watch company Storm , which ha a range of unusual Japanese-made quartz watch . One is the aptly named Darth Mirror , an oversize hexagonal-shaped men ’ s watch that wouldn ’ t look out of place in a sci-fi blockbuster : With six mirrored panel , the dial display the hour , minute and second via a rotating disc with a multicolored counter . Priced at £109.99 , it ha been a best seller for nearly a decade , the brand manager Alya Kepa said : “ These are statement piece . They can help accessorize your look for something more edgy or more party-like . ”
 Another conversation starter is the Vaultron Mirror ( £139.99 ) with a “ Star Wars ” -esque V-shaped blue LED display ; or the Elevator Mirror ( £129.99 ) , similar to the Darth but in a classic round shape . The Temptress Charm ( £99.99 ) is a best seller for woman , the cutout style round watch featuring screw-style index on it mirror face .
 Neon color are also trending , Ms. Kepa said , adding that Storm ’ s Cody watch ( from £119.99 ) come in a range of vibrantly colored reflective dial that surely would pas Ms. Bucci ’ s spinach-in-teeth test . But “ from far away , ” Ms. Kepa said , “ it doesn ’ t even look like a watch but more just an accessory . ”
 The Swiss house Movado also ha played with highly reflective face , and notably via pitch-black dial , such a the ultra-classic 1881 Automatic ( $ 1,195 ) , in 39.5 millimeter with a self-winding Swiss movement . The Movado Bold range is more fashion forward — it dial combine a sun-ray polished steel center with a mirrorlike ring that take on the look of a bezel . Most eye-catching are an edgy , monochrome version with a chain-stitched black leather strap , and a warmer gold version with eyelet detail on the strap ( both 36 millimeter , $ 495 ) . More classic model come courtesy of the men ’ s all-around gold-plated watch with a matching Milanese strap ( $ 595 ) .
 What ’ s best about mirror dial is their flexibility . As Jasmine Audemars , chairwoman of Audemars Piguet ’ s board of director and fan of the new mirror-dial Royal Oak , said , “ Who need a selfie when you can look at yourself in your watch ? ”

 In Fort Collins , Colo. , a vacant Toys “ R ” Us store is being turned into an adventure park , with trampoline and dodge ball court . Scandinavian furniture ha replaced Fisher-Price baby gear at a location in Sioux Falls , S.D . In northwest Atlanta , a Hobby Lobby is moving in .
 At shopping center where Toys “ R ” Us wa a key tenant before it messy liquidation last June , trace of the bankrupt chain are steadily being erased . And a the industry ’ s main showcase in North America , Toy Fair New York , open this weekend , many in the fun-and-games trade are trying to move on a well .
 But Toys “ R ” Us isn ’ t ready to let go .
 On the brink of imploding at this time last year , the retailer is now embarking on a revival set in motion month ago by the hedge fund that own it debt and control it intellectual property .
 A new entity , Tru Kids , is “ starting with a clean sheet of canvas , ” said Richard Barry , the company ’ s chief executive and a former chief merchandising officer of Toys “ R ” Us . Introduced this week , the company will manage brand that include Toys “ R ” Us , Babies “ R ” Us and Geoffrey the Giraffe , the Toys “ R ” Us mascot .
 So far , there are few detail about Tru Kids ’ plan . It ha no physical operation or e-commerce presence in the United States . Toys “ R ” Us , unable to sustain it vast portfolio of huge store and carrying $ 5 billion in debt , closed all 730 of it location last year . Any store Tru Kids open will probably be smaller than it predecessor ’ s , with an emphasis on what Mr. Barry described a in-store experience and technology-enabled shopping .
 “ Nothing is signed , nothing is set in stone , ” he said . “ We absolutely don ’ t want to overpromise in any way what this is . ”
 Attempts at comeback are not unusual among retailer . F.A.O . Schwarz wa reincarnated in modified form last year , three year after shutting down . Many company , under pressure from Amazon and other online outlet , have learned to adapt in their own way .
 The Tru Kids leader , most of them former Toys “ R ” Us executive , plan to meet with dozen of vendor at Toy Fair to promote their new endeavor . Mr. Barry is set to help give out the industry ’ s equivalent of the Academy Award for best movie , the Toy of the Year award .
 A tough crowd awaits .
 Mark Carson , a founder of the manufacturer and retailer Fat Brain Toys , is among those wary of Toys “ R ” Us rising from the dead . He said he still had a “ bitter taste ” in his mouth after the company shut down without fully repaying him . But the amount he wa owed — le than $ 100,000 — wa dwarfed by the outstanding balance of many other vendor , he said .
 “ I ’ m not going to roll the dice on their new business , ” he said . “ I ’ m open to working with them , but it ’ s not like I ’ m desperately waiting for them to come back . ”
 The collapse of Toys “ R ” Us had far-reaching effect . Tens of thousand of worker lost job . Competitors were undercut when liquidation sale flooded the market with deeply discounted good . Vendors locked into exclusive contract with the chain scrambled to find new outlet . Last week , Hasbro , the world ’ s largest toymaker , blamed the “ unprecedented ” store closing for holiday earnings that fell well short of expectation .
 “ It wa traumatic for the industry , ” said Richard Gottlieb , the founder of Global Toy Experts , a consulting firm . How traumatic ? Mr. Gottlieb said that the last time he saw Geoffrey at an industry event , he “ didn ’ t know whether to hug him or punch him in the face . ”
 The toy business is under plenty of pressure beyond the demise of Toys “ R ” Us . Shoppers are defecting to mobile apps and video game . Birthrates are slumping , shrinking the market . Sears , another big seller of toy , narrowly escaped liquidation .
 President Trump ’ s trade war with China , where 85 percent of the toy sold in American store are made , is also a threat . Retailers are asking toy maker to deliver spring order early , in case the White House add more tariff on Chinese import . Representatives of Hasbro , Lego , Mattel and other toy company were in Washington last week lobbying against escalating the trade war .
 “ If you are a manufacturer of toy , you are in a pretty tough position , and so are the retailer , because at this point in time , no one know what ’ s going to happen , ” said Lutz Muller , the president of the consulting firm Klosters Trading .
 In the most recent holiday season , the confusion caused by the absence of Toys “ R ” Us wa clear .
 Sellers of all stripe tried to fill the void , often slashing price to compete . Mass-market retailer like Target and Walmart made extra shelf space for popular toy that also popped up in supermarket and electronics store . Amazon mailed out a thick toy catalog , a first for the company . Shoppers ignored smaller impulse buy after loading up earlier in the year on bargain-bin item from closing Toys “ R ” Us store .
 Many specialty retailer had hoped for a “ huge boost ” after the closing , said Richard Derr , who owns a Learning Express store in the Chicago area . It never came . Only a third of what would have been Toys “ R ” Us sale during the holiday wound up going to other retailer , Wall Street analyst estimated .
 “ Most of it went ‘ poof ’ , ” said Mr. Derr , who lead a group of more than 100 Learning Express franchisees . “ It ’ s the old buffet effect : If it ’ s right in front of them , people will eat . If not , they go without . ”
 Mr. Carson of Fat Brain , known for it Squigz suction cup building toy , said toy seller hope to build a buffer of revenue in the spring and summer before rival like Walmart and Amazon return in full force for what he called the “ bloody ” winter season .
 “ Toy specialist used to take for granted that the holiday season wa easy money , but now it ’ s a knife fight , ” he said . “ We ’ re not just competing against other toy store ; now the largest retailer in the world are trying to duke it out . ”
 Despite a 2 percent drop in sale last year , the $ 21.6 billion industry is hardly failing . Toys inspired by coming installment of the “ Star Wars ” and “ Avengers ” franchise and other movie are expected to provide a lift this year . ( Mattel is going Hollywood , too , with a live-action Barbie film . )
 Still , the Toys “ R ” Us meltdown ha trained those in the trade to be wary .
 Crayola and other supplier complained that the company continued to order product on credit long after it knew it could not pay for them . Others have accused the company of using bullying tactic in negotiating price , severe cost-cutting campaign and being ignorant of digital innovation .
 “ There are very low level of trust going into this — a lot of people were hurt , and they were never an easy company to deal with , ” said Mr. Gottlieb of Global Toy Experts . “ It can not be business a usual . ”
 Tru Kids , which is based in Parsippany , N.J. , said that it licensing partner operated 900 store in 30 country , and that it brand generated $ 3 billion a year in revenue . Its focus is the United States , where it hope to be serving consumer by Christmas .
 The liquidation wa “ extremely regrettable , ” said Mr. Barry , the Tru Kids chief executive , but “ this brand doe not deserve to go away in the United States . ”

 Our expert ha been closely following the race and the voter , all season . Here ’ s what he think will happen at the ceremony on Sunday .
 By Kyle Buchanan
 This crazy , mixed-up Oscar season come to a close with Sunday night ’ s ceremony , which will forgo a host and , after plenty of controversy , still present all 24 category on the air . But which movie is poised to win the biggest race of them all and take the Oscar for best picture ?
 Alfonso Cuarón ’ s black-and-white art film “ Roma ” is a critical favorite that took the top trophy from the Directors Guild of America , but a foreign-language film ha never won best picture , let alone one distributed by the insurgent streaming service Netflix . Many Oscar voter love the racial-issues dramedy “ Green Book , ” which wa given top honor by the oft-predictive Producers Guild of America , but the film couldn ’ t even nab a best-director nomination .
 [ Follow our live update and analysis from the Oscars ceremony , and see the best look from the red carpet . ]
 So though we ’ ve got two ostensible front-runner , this is still anybody ’ s game : After all , “ A Star Is Born ” once looked unbeatable , too , and now it ’ s limping to the finish line with a scant few trophy under it belt .
 [ Fill out your Oscar ballot . | Catch up on all the controversy and the Oscar-weekend party and event . ]
 ✓ “ Roma ” “ A Star Is Born ” “ BlacKkKlansman ” “ Black Panther ” “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” “ The Favourite ” “ Green Book ” “ Vice ”
 Of the other contender , a win for Spike Lee ’ s “ BlacKkKlansman ” or the Marvel phenomenon “ Black Panther ” would be historic . The royal comedy “ The Favourite ” rode across-the-board support to 10 nomination . The two music-driven drama , “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” and “ A Star Is Born , ” claim passionate fan and equally engaged detractor . And a vote for the Dick Cheney indictment “ Vice ” would at least send a political message .
 With all that in mind , I still think the industry prize given to “ Roma ” add up to a best-picture win that will prove to be a game-changing moment for Netflix . If a streamer can take the top Oscar , then all bet are off .
 ✓ Glenn Close “ The Wife ” Yalitza Aparicio “ Roma ” Olivia Colman “ The Favourite ” Lady Gaga “ A Star Is Born ” Melissa McCarthy “ Can You Ever Forgive Me ”
 A seven-time Oscar nominee , Glenn Close is poised to pick up her first statuette for her finely crafted work a a secretive spouse in “ The Wife. ” It ’ s been age since Close had a showcase role like this , and the 71-year-old actress galvanized voter further after a moving , personal Golden Globe acceptance speech in January . Her primary competition is a first-time nominee , Olivia Colman , who just won Bafta ’ s top prize for playing the queen in “ The Favourite ” and is fronting one of the night ’ s most nominated film .
 ✓ Rami Malek “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” Christian Bale “ Vice ” Bradley Cooper “ A Star Is Born ” Willem Dafoe “ At Eternity ’ s Gate ” Viggo Mortensen “ Green Book ”
 Oscar voter are sucker for a transformation , and this category offer two ostentatious example in Rami Malek , who played the Queen frontman Freddie Mercury with real swagger in “ Bohemian Rhapsody , ” and Christian Bale , who wa unrecognizable a Dick Cheney in “ Vice. ” Malek ha been one of this season ’ s most willing and able campaigner , and his film is a box-office sensation , so the 37-year-old actor is poised to become one of the youngest recipient of this award in recent memory .
 ✓ Regina King “ If Beale Street Could TalkAmy Adams “ Vice ” Emma Stone “ The Favourite ” Marina de Tavira “ Roma ” Rachel Weisz “ The Favourite ”
 This category promise to be one of the night ’ s most suspenseful race . The “ If Beale Street Could Talk ” star Regina King won the Golden Globe and Critics Choice Award , but she wa n't even nominated by the Screen Actors Guild or Bafta . The latter group gave it prize to Rachel Weisz , who hail from a best-picture nominee but may split vote with Emma Stone , her co-star from “ The Favourite. ” And then there ’ s the “ Vice ” nominee Amy Adams , whose Oscar win is long overdue . My guess is King will prevail : At the recent Oscar nominee ’ luncheon , she and Mahershala Ali were the two most-applauded contender .
 ✓Mahershala Ali “ Green Book ” Adam Driver “ BlacKkKlansman '' Sam Elliott “ A Star Is Born ” Richard E. Grant “ Can You Ever Forgive Me ? `` Sam Rockwell “ Vice ”
 Can Mahershala Ali become the second black actor after Denzel Washington to win more than one Oscar for acting ? All sign point to yes , a Ali ha swept the precursor this season for his work a the gifted pianist Don Shirley in “ Green Book. ” Only two thing are working against him : Ali won this same category two year ago for “ Moonlight , ” and voter may not be in such a hurry to reward him again so soon , while Richard E. Grant , the “ Can You Ever Forgive Me ? ” star , ha charmed his fair share of admirer on the award circuit and could prove to be a dark-horse winner .
 ✓ Alfonso Cuarón “ Roma '' Yorgos Lanthimos “ The Favourite ” Spike Lee `` BlacKkKlansman ” Adam McKay “ Vice ” Pawel Pawlikowski “ Cold War ”
 Though Barry Jenkins ( “ Moonlight ” ) and Steve McQueen ( “ 12 Years a Slave ” ) have seen their film win best picture , neither man won the best director Oscar . This present a clear path for Spike Lee to become the first black filmmaker to triumph in this category , except that he is up against Alfonso Cuarón , who ha taken every major directing prize this season . While the academy ha more of an imperative to reward Lee , who ha famously never won a competitive Oscar , Cuarón will be tough to topple .
 ✓ “ RBG ” “ Free Solo ” “ Hale County This Morning , This Evening ” “ Minding the Gap ” “ Of Fathers and Sons ”
 Last year ’ s biggest documentary , “ Wo n't You Be My Neighbor ? , ” wa also one of Oscar 's biggest snub . In it wake , two other breakout hit are best positioned to win this Oscar : the Ruth Bader Ginsburg documentary “ RBG , ” which also scored a nomination for original song , and the breathtaking rock-climber story “ Free Solo. ” The latter is more of a cinematic feat , but checking the box for “ RBG ” let voter throw their weight behind the indefatigable Supreme Court justice herself .
 ✓ “ The Favourite ” “ First Reformed '' “ Green Book ” “ Roma '' “ Vice ”
 “ Green Book ” won the Golden Globe , “ The Favourite ” scored with Bafta , and the Writers Guild gave it top prize in this category to Bo Burnham ’ s “ Eighth Grade , ” a film the Oscars didn ’ t even nominate . The race is likely to come down to “ Green Book ” and “ The Favourite , ” and the latter ’ s malicious wit give it the edge . Still , if “ Green Book ” pull off a win here early in the night , that could presage an eventual best-picture victory .
 ✓ “ BlacKkKlansman '' “ A Star Is Born ” “ The Ballad of Buster Scruggs ” “ Can You Ever Forgive Me ? ” “ If Beale Street Could Talk ”
 The screenplay Oscar often go to an auteur the academy is not quite hip enough to reward in the directing category , like Jordan Peele , Spike Jonze or Sofia Coppola . I wonder , then , if the adapted-screenplay race might be the safest place for voter to reward Spike Lee , one of four credited writer of “ BlacKkKlansman. ” Still , do n't count out Writers Guild winner “ Can You Ever Forgive Me ? , ” which ha it passionate fan and is , in it own larcenous way , about the very act of adaptation itself .
 ✓ “ Spider-Man : Into the Spider-Verse ” “ Incredibles 2 ” “ Isle of Dogs ” “ Mirai ” “ Ralph Breaks the internet ''
 Pixar ’ s superhero sequel “ Incredibles 2 ” is the highest-grossing animated film in history , and it director , Brad Bird , ha won this category twice , including for the first “ Incredibles. ” That 's formidable competition , and yet the contender with all the momentum is “ Spider-Man : Into the Spider-Verse , ” which came late in the year but ha picked up all the big animation prize . Even if “ Black Panther ” doesn ’ t take home best picture , expect at least one Marvel superhero to triumph on Oscar night .
 ✓ “ Roma ” Mexico “ Capernaum ” Lebanon “ Cold War ” Poland “ Never Look Away ” Germany “ Shoplifters ” Japan
 This is one of the strongest foreign-film lineup in recent memory , and in any other year , all of these movie would have the profile of a winner , including the Palme d ’ Or winner “ Shoplifters , ” Lebanon ’ s moving “ Capernaum , ” and “ Cold War ” and “ Never Look Away , ” which both scored cinematography nomination a well . ( “ Cold War ” even cracked the race for best director . ) Still , in a year when “ Roma ” could make history a the first foreign-language film to win best picture , it would seem outrageous for the movie to miss this prize on it path to victory .
 ✓ “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” “ BlacKkKlansman ” “ The Favourite ” “ Green Book ” “ Vice ”
 Action film have dominated this category for the last few year , but none were nominated this time . Of these five contender , “ Vice ” is the most aggressively edited by it very nature , because the director Adam McKay employ so much high-concept crosscutting . Many of my fellow pundit expect it to win , but I suspect “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” will pull out a shock victory , since many in the industry credit the editor John Ottman with salvaging the footage from a difficult shoot from which the original director , Bryan Singer , wa fired .
 ✓ “ Roma ” “ Cold War ” “ The Favourite ” “ Never Look Away ” “ A Star Is Born ”
 Initially , the academy had planned to give out this Oscar during a commercial break , and I suspect that ’ s because the front-runner is Cuarón , who is likely to dominate the telecast with multiple acceptance speech . Now that the academy ha bent to the industry backlash and reinstated this category in the regular part of the broadcast , you can expect Cuarón to make Oscar history a the first director to win the cinematography award for shooting his own film .
 ✓ “ The Favourite ” “ Black Panther ” “ First Man ”
 “ Mary Poppins Returns ”
 “ Roma ”
 Cinematography and production design ought to work in concert , and the eccentric lensing favored by the director of “ The Favourite , ” Yorgos Lanthimos , and his director of photography , Robbie Ryan , provides a great showcase for the film ’ s set , which take up much more of the fish-eye frame than they might on a conventionally shot movie . Voters also tend to prefer lavish period film here , which give “ The Favourite ” the edge over the futuristic “ Black Panther . ”
 ✓ “ First Man ” “ Avengers : Infinity War ” “ Christopher Robin ” “ Ready Player One ” “ Solo : A Star Wars Story ”
 The Visual Effects Society gave it main prize to “ Avengers : Infinity War , ” which juggled dozen of computer-aided hero and a motion-captured villain , but Oscar ha not rewarded a superhero film here since “ Spider-Man 2 ” came out 15 year ago . That favor “ First Man , ” which failed to make the best-picture cut but at least had the heft of a contender , unlike fellow nominee “ Ready Player One , ” “ Christopher Robin ” and “ Solo : A Star Wars Story . ”
 ✓ “ BlacKkKlansman ” “ Black Panther ” “ If Beale Street Could Talk ” “ Isle of Dogs ” “ Mary Poppins Returns ”
 For my money , none of last year ’ s score were a beautiful a the love-soaked swoon composed by Nicholas Britell for “ If Beale Street Could Talk. ” Then again , Jonny Greenwood ’ s “ Phantom Thread ” score wa the clear standout the year before , and it lost to “ The Shape of Water. ” This is all to say that though anything could happen in this category , the Oscar will probably go to the film with the most best-picture heat , winnowing the field to “ Black Panther ” and “ BlacKkKlansman. ” In a close race , I ’ m picking Terence Blanchard ’ s distinctive composition for “ BlacKkKlansman . ”
 ✓ “ Shallow ” “ A Star Is Born ”
 “ All the Stars ” “ Black Panther ”
 “ I ’ ll Fight ” “ RBG ''
 “ The Place Where Lost Things Go ” “ Mary Poppins Returns ”
 “ When a Cowboy Trades His Spurs for Wings ” “ The Ballad of Buster Scruggs ”
 I will let out a note a prolonged a Lady Gaga ’ s melismatic trailer howl if anything but “ Shallow ” win this Oscar . It is the centerpiece duet of “ A Star Is Born , ” the source material for one of last year ’ s most iconic movie scene and an irresistible earworm , so how could it not win ? Well , just to play devil ’ s advocate : If voter wanted to truly put an exclamation point on the award-season underperformance of “ A Star Is Born , ” they could deprive Bradley Cooper ’ s former front-runner of the only Oscar it is likely to take . But the academy wouldn ’ t stoop to such a troll move , would it ?
 ✓ “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” “ Black Panther ” “ First Man ” “ Roma ” “ A Star Is Born ”
 This Oscar tends to go to war film and movie musical , and in the absence of any soldier ’ story , we ’ ve got two song-laden contender in “ A Star Is Born ” and “ Bohemian Rhapsody. ” Cooper made the better film , but “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” ha all the momentum , and it end with a multisong concert that will clinch this win .
 ✓ “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” “ A Quiet Place ” “ Black Panther ” “ First Man ” “ Roma ”
 Sound editing is different from sound mixing in that it honor the creation of sound , rather than how they are woven together in an aural landscape . Few movie had a strong a focus on sound a the horror thriller “ A Quiet Place , ” while the creaky shuttle in “ First Man ” drove home just how perilous the mission to the moon really wa . Still , I think many Oscar voter won ’ t quite grok the difference between these sound category , and they ’ ll simply pick “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” for both .
 ✓ “ The Favourite ” “ The Ballad of Buster Scruggs ” “ Black Panther ” “ Mary Poppins Returns ” “ Mary Queen of Scots ”
 If you gave the vote to all the kid who dressed up on Halloween a Killmonger , T ’ Challa or the Dora Milaje , “ Black Panther ” would win in a walk . Alas , this Oscar almost always go to royal period piece , so I am predicting “ The Favourite ” will triumph in a close race . I ’ ve got nothing against those luscious costume , I just happen to believe that the long-overdue “ Black Panther ” designer , Ruth E. Carter , should win the Academy Award for Angela Bassett ’ s hat alone . I mean , did you see that ?
 ✓ “ Vice ” “ Border ” “ Mary Queen of Scots ”
 This Oscar almost always go to the team that worked on a best-picture contender or a performance that is likely to win an Oscar , which eliminates “ Mary Queen of Scots ” and the beguilingly offbeat “ Border. ” We ’ d at least have a more interesting race if “ Suspiria ” had been nominated for it transformation of Tilda Swinton into an elderly man , but given the field a it stand , “ Vice ” is the clear winner for encasing Christian Bale in Dick Cheney ’ s visage .
 ✓ “ Bao ” “ Animal Behaviour ” “ Late Afternoon ” “ One Small Step ” “ Weekends ”
 Though they are all animated in strikingly different way , several of this year ’ s short nominee have an undeniably Pixar feel to them , in that they telescope the span of an entire life into a single heart-tugging montage . Of them , the actual Pixar short ha the best chance at winning : Domee Shi ’ s “ Bao , ” which played before “ Incredibles 2 , ” is a clever film about a Chinese-Canadian woman who pours her love for her son into the food she make , with surprising result .
 ✓ “ Skin ”
 “ Detainment ”
 “ Fauve ”
 “ Marguerite ”
 “ Mother ”
 Mad respect to anyone who can make it through all five of these short , a beautifully shot but brutal lot in which nearly every story is about child in distress . Two nominee I think voter may respond to are “ Fauve , ” a harrowing story about two boy encountering quicksand , and “ Skin , ” a good-looking but incredibly obvious parable about race that star Hollywood actor like Danielle Macdonald and Jonathan Tucker . “ Marguerite ” is a wistful story about an elderly woman that will win point for harming no child , but I wonder if it may be too slight to win . “ Skin , ” for all it familiarity , probably ha the inside track .
 ✓ “ Period . End of Sentence . ”
 “ A Night at the Garden ”
 “ Black Sheep ”
 “ End Game ”
 “ Lifeboat ”
 This is the strongest of this year ’ s three short-film crop . Some voter may be drawn to “ A Night at the Garden , ” a documentary using footage of a 1939 Nazi rally at Madison Square Garden , since it recently made headline when Fox News refused to run an ad for it . Still , the two strongest entry are probably the one pushed by Netflix : “ Period . End of Sentence. , ” an empowering story of Indian woman manufacturing sanitary pad , and “ End Game , ” about an end-of-life care facility . The former , with it welcome moment of lightness and humor , may prove to be Oscar 's pick .

 Life for New Yorkers is likely to change in way big and small thanks to the state ’ s $ 175 billion budget , which the Legislature and Governor Cuomo agreed to early Sunday .
 In addition to fiscal policy , a raft of nonmonetary policy were inserted into the budget , usually a bargaining chip to win the support of reluctant lawmaker . Albany ’ s veteran refer to the hefty deal a “ the big ugly . ”
 [ After week of intraparty bickering , lawmaker made a deal on the state budget . ]
 One topic left out of the budget ? Marijuana . Mr. Cuomo had vowed to legalize the drug , but stakeholder were unable to reach an agreement before today ’ s budget deadline . A similar deal collapsed in New Jersey .

 Cash bail will be eliminated for most misdemeanor and nonviolent crime .

 The state also plan to give defendant speedier access to evidence that prosecutor may use against them in court .
 Buyers of some New York City home will be hit with higher tax .
 Legislators initially wanted to tax owner of pieds-à-terre , luxury home that are not primary residence . This fee would have been collected every year .

 The tax would be charged when a home is sold . Combined , the tax rate would top out at 4.15 percent on the sale of property worth $ 25 million or more .

 Space travel is in vogue , which may help explain why a robotics competition chose “ Destination : Deep Space ” a it theme .
 The New York City regional round of the FIRST Robotics Competition for high schoolers is this weekend at the Armory in Washington Heights , Manhattan . Winners will compete at the world championship in Detroit .
 Weeks ago , student began building robot from starter kit sent to them by the competition ’ s organizer . To score point at the tournament , the robot must complete various task .
 This year , the main task is to put large orange ball into basket throughout a field about the size of a volleyball court . Or , a the competition ’ s website describes it : “ The alliance must gather a many cargo pod a possible and prepare their spaceship before the next sandstorm arrives . ”
 In each round , robot from three school form a team . Two team compete per round . By the end of the tournament , school will go from collaborating to competing and back to collaborating .
 Norm Sutaria , the director of community engagement for the regional organization , said John Dewey High School , which made it to the championship last year , is a powerhouse . Queens Technical High is “ a strong , dominant force , ” he added , and Stuyvesant High ha a competitive team .
 Frederick Douglass Academy is a leader in the region , Mr. Sutaria continued . And the all-girls team from the Bronx High School of Science , called the Iron Maidens , is “ very strong . ”
 Attendees can visit the pit , where they can talk to student and inspect the robot up close . There ’ s also a live feed for watching the competition .
 The event , Mr. Sutaria said , is about “ kid building robot but also robot building kids. ” Students “ learn the hard technical skill , but then that ’ s also wrapped around the social , emotional learning piece , and teamwork and collaboration , and giving and taking feedback . ”
 “ It ’ s essentially being competitive , yet kind , ” he added . “ This is much more of robot cooperating together , not heavy-duty , sort of kill-the-other-robot type of competition . ”
 It ’ s Monday — Don ’ t let robot control you .
 Dear Diary :
 I lost my wallet in Midtown early one morning . At around 1 p.m. that day , I got a call from a man who said he had found it .
 Although he didn ’ t speak English very well , he managed to tell me that he worked from 3 a.m. to noon delivering propane to coffee cart from Midtown to the financial district and that he hadn ’ t been able to call me until he got home to Queens . He apologized for opening my wallet to find my business card .
 He told me he would leave the wallet at a coffee cart on 50th Street and Sixth Avenue , where I would be able to pick it up the next day any time after 3 a.m . I asked him to put it in a bag , so that it wasn ’ t obvious it wa a wallet .
 Despite everything I said , he wouldn ’ t let me send him anything to thank him . I asked his name several time , and he told me several time , but I couldn ’ t understand him . When I asked him to spell it , that didn ’ t work either . After we hung up , I received a simple text : just his first name .
 At 5:45 a.m. the next day I got a text with a photo of the cart where he had left the wallet ( there were two cart on the block , and he didn ’ t want me to be confused ) . When I got there , my wallet wa in a plastic bag , and inside the bag wa a silver gift bag and a card with my name and his .
 Before I could call him , he called me to ask if I had picked up my wallet . Again , he refused to agree to let me do anything for him . He said he wa happy I had gotten my wallet back . That wa more than enough for him .

 Good morning ,
 We start today with the latest round in the Trump-Pelosi feud , uncounted family separation at the border , and a contentious verdict in a case involving the Chicago police . And it ’ s Friday , so there ’ s a new news quiz .
 The capital now “ resembles nothing so much a an unruly sandbox , ” one of our White House correspondent writes . “ As the shutdown drag on , septuagenarian politician are squabbling like 7-year-olds . ”
 On Thursday , a day after Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked President Trump to delay his State of the Union address , he denied her access to a military plane for a congressional visit to American troop in Afghanistan . “ Obviously , ” he said in a letter , flying commercial remained an option .
 Mr. Trump also canceled plan to send a U.S. delegation to Davos , Switzerland , next week for the World Economic Forum .
 The impact : The partial government shutdown is in it 28th day , and federal court are running out of money . They ’ re expected to be able to continue funded operation through at least next Friday .
 The Trump administration most likely separated thousand more migrant child from their parent at the southwestern border than wa previously believed , according to a government report released on Thursday .
 The federal government ha reported that nearly 3,000 child were forcibly separated from their parent last year under the “ zero tolerance ” immigration policy .

 Senator Cory Booker spun through a San Francisco fund-raiser hosted on Friday afternoon by high-tech titan and wealthy venture capitalist , including the investor Ron Conway . That evening , in New York , Senator Kirsten Gillibrand gathered donation at the Upper West Side home of Matthew Mallow , a vice chairman of the investment giant BlackRock .
 And on Sunday night , Senator Kamala Harris is set to mingle with Hollywood luminary at the home of the president of the MGM Motion Picture Group , Jonathan Glickman .
 The race for cash in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary is reaching a frenetic peak this weekend with a dozen fund-raisers on both coast , a presidential hopeful rush to vacuum up $ 2,800 check — the maximum amount individual can give for the primary by law — before the first quarterly fund-raising deadline of the campaign at midnight on Sunday .
 But the candidate don ’ t want to discus any of this .
 They are instead trying to pull off a delicate balancing act . Publicly , the 2020 hopeful are all about attracting low-dollar donor , trying to prove their grass-roots appeal and populist bona fides by touting large number of small donation — an ascendant force in Democratic politics . But privately , most Democrats also badly need the big check and are still going behind closed door to woo the wealthy , whose money is critical to pay for campaign staff , travel and advertising .
 [ Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race . ]
 As a result , a traditional part of presidential race early on — candidate trumpeting big-money and well-connected contributor a a show of political strength — ha gone virtually underground , the invisible primary turning truly invisible . The jockeying for major donor remains a intense a ever , but the usual campaign announcement of powerhouse finance committee and boldfaced bundler list have all but disappeared . Even some online R.S.V.P . page for fund-raisers don ’ t identify the wealthy backer anymore .
 Amy Dacey , the former chief executive officer of the Democratic National Committee , said the donor dynamic this cycle are “ fundamentally different ” than before .
 “ Candidates talk more about how many different donor they have and how many state they ’ re in , ” she said . “ It ’ s more about the donor amount than the dollar amounts. ” But , Ms. Dacey added of big donor , “ They still need them . ”
 Two prominent candidate , Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren , have disavowed the traditional money circuit entirely — a safe bet for Mr. Sanders , whose online donor network amply funded his 2016 run , but a far riskier gambit for Ms. Warren , who ha a far smaller base of low-dollar contributor .
 Beto O ’ Rourke , the former Texas congressman , began calling some donor to seek support before he entered the race this month , but he is expected to lean heavily on a small-donor network that netted more than 100,000 contribution and $ 6.1 million in his first 24 hour . He ha held no fund-raisers so far and ha none planned yet in the future , according to his campaign .
 [ Keep up with the 2020 field with our candidate tracker . ]
 Unlike in 2016 , when the Democratic donor class rallied to Hillary Clinton , or 2008 , when giver lined up with Mrs. Clinton , Barack Obama and John Edwards , many of the party ’ s wealthiest figure remain firmly on the sideline , serving a perhaps the biggest check on the role of big money in 2020 to date .
 That ha given an advantage to Mr. O ’ Rourke and Mr. Sanders , who are banking on small donation . Those two , plus Ms. Harris , who ha a strong small-donor network and ha been aggressively courting larger contributor , are widely expected to raise the most in the first quarter .
 Several 2020 hopeful have spent recent week canvassing the country , from Dallas to Miami , Chicago to Los Angeles , to raise the money needed in a crowded primary that is expected to easily cost hundred of million of dollar .
 At fund-raising event , attendee say , most 2020 candidate typically are delivering more intimate version of their stump speech , pitching their vision for the country along with a heavy dosage on their political viability and pathway to the presidency , amid caterer circulating with drink and snack .
 Last Tuesday , Ms. Harris wa in the tony Washington neighborhood of Kalorama at an event where host were asked to raise at least $ 10,000 ( although the price point were not listed on the front of at least one version of the emailed invitation ) . The Saturday before that , Mr. Booker wa feted at the home of Gov . Phil Murphy of New Jersey a the singer Jon Bon Jovi circulated in the crowd ahead of a three-course dinner that pulled in $ 300,000 , according to a person familiar with the event . And before that , Senator Amy Klobuchar wa in Chicago asking for money at the home of a former Goldman Sachs banker who later served a ambassador to Canada , Bruce A. Heyman .
 In between , donor are hearing from the candidate by phone . A lot .
 “ When I see a 202 number these day , I don ’ t usually answer it , ” said Amber Mostyn , a Houston-based attorney and prominent Democratic fund-raiser , joking about the Washington area code and the number of candidate who have reached out for help .
 According to several donor a well a invitation obtained by The New York Times , four senator — Mr. Booker , Ms. Gillibrand , Ms. Harris and Ms. Klobuchar — have been particularly aggressive on the national donor circuit . Former Gov . John Hickenlooper of Colorado and Gov . Jay Inslee of Washington , and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend , Ind. , have been making call and organizing event , a well .
 “ It take a lot of time away from what we should be doing , ” said John Delaney , the former Maryland congressman and businessman running for president , who is mostly avoiding the money chase by self-funding his campaign . “ I guess you ’ d call it a necessary evil . ”
 Schedules are often constructed , at least in part , around raising money . So while a recent trip by Ms. Harris to Texas drew headline for her decision to rally in the home state of Mr. O ’ Rourke , the visit wa also about raising money , with a fund-raiser at the Dallas home of Jill Louis , a partner in the law firm K & L Gates . ( Ms. Louis is also a trustee of Howard University , Ms. Harris ’ s alma mater . )
 Some big donor who remain unaligned are waiting for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr . Some are holding out for the field to thin . Others are writing check to a number of contender without committing exclusively for any one of them .
 Mitchell Berger , a longtime South Florida fund-raiser and self-described political “ dinosaur , ” who fondly recall his work on behalf of a young Al Gore in 1987 , rattled off the name of five candidate who had called him . But Mr. Berger said that , while he had given to some , he had not yet hosted event or bundled contribution for anyone because he want to see how the race will unfold .
 In April , Steven Rattner and Blair Effron , two prominent donor in New York , are planning a dinner for unaligned donor to discus how and when to engage in a primary contest that is more unpredictable than any in a generation .
 “ It ’ s completely different than 2016 , ” Henry R. Munoz III , the Democratic National Committee finance chair and a longtime Democratic donor , said of the lack of urgency among fund-raisers this year . He added : “ Most of my donor are enjoying getting to know the candidate and being courted a little bit . ”
 Some big name have taken side , according to people familiar with their activity . Laurie Tisch , a wealthy philanthropist , is supporting Mr. Booker and recently held an event for him in New York . Naomi Aberly , the former chairwoman of the Planned Parenthood Federation of American board , is raising money for Ms. Gillibrand and organized a Texas fund-raiser for her already . Wayne Jordan and Quinn Delaney , an influential political couple in Oakland , are backing Ms. Harris .
 Ms. Warren ha essentially abandoned the pursuit of such donor , even though some have raised big sum for her in the past .
 “ This is our chance to run a grass-roots movement , not just to go around the country scooping up a much money a we can , ” Ms. Warren said in an interview .
 But for those Democrats who are seeking cash in big chunk , Hollywood ha been , a ever , a deep well .
 On one night in mid-March , Ms. Harris wa hosted at the home of J.J. Abrams , the director of recent “ Star Trek ” and “ Star Wars ” movie , with a who ’ s who list of co-hosts . Across town , Ms. Klobuchar wa schmoozing with donor at the home of Jay Sures , the co-president of the United Talent Agency , with co-hosts including the talent agent Peter Benedek and the television producer Marcy Carsey , a longtime Democratic donor .
 Lawyers have long been another mainstay of the Democratic donor circuit . Ms. Gillibrand got her start in politics raising money while working a a Manhattan attorney ; she ha three fund-raisers just this weekend at the home of law firm partner , two of whom she once worked with .
 One of Ms. Gillibrand ’ s other event , on Sunday , ha stirred some criticism ; it is at the home of Sally Susman , a senior executive with the pharmaceutical company Pfizer . Though Ms. Susman is a longtime friend of Ms. Gillibrand ’ s , the event ha served a a cautionary tale of the potential downside of fund-raising with industry executive .
 Still , many veteran of Democratic fund-raising believe that the eventual nominee will have to marry a robust network of small-dollar online giver with a high-dollar fund-raising operation in order to both claim the nomination and defeat President Trump .
 Notably , Ms. Warren left open the possibility of attending fund-raisers again , should she become the nominee . “ I do not believe in unilateral disarmament , ” she said of running against Republicans .
 Julianna Smoot , who ran Mr. Obama ’ s 2008 finance operation , recalled that the former president raised considerable grass-roots money but also spent hour on the phone building a team of bundlers .
 “ He did a lot of max-out , traditional fund-raising , ” she said . “ You have to have an integrated approach . ”

 IN 1909 , THE GODFATHER of Futurism , Filippo Tommaso Marinetti , published his manifesto in Le Figaro , the Paris daily . Glorifying virility , patriotism and war — “ the only hygiene for the world ” — the Italian poet envisioned a future shaped by speed and technology , but also by “ scorn for woman , ” and advocated a radical break with the bourgeois conception of the past , including the destruction of library and museum . “ We stand on the last promontory of the century ! Why should we look back , when what we want is to break down the mysterious door of the impossible ? ”
 More than a century later , this sound quaint ( and brutish ) , but it ’ s hard not to feel a twinge of tenderness for this wild love of progress , for “ deep-chested locomotive ” and racing car “ adorned with great pipe , like serpents. ” While short-lived ( about two decade ) and somewhat blurry in principle ( Marinetti later became a fascist , then an academician ) , Futurism would translate into a distinctive visual style with enduring influence , and not only in art . Futurism differed from other Modernist movement , like Cubism , in that it wa meant to speak to the way we live , from politics to fashion . It wa the Futurist painter Giacomo Balla who set out tenet for clothing design in 1914 , promoting bold or even clashing color , geometric pattern and freedom of movement ; banished were symmetry , harmony and tradition . Before ready-to-wear came to dominate the industry , Futurists anticipated that perpetual obsolescence would be at the heart of fashion itself , requiring creativity on the part of designer to provide novelty for the wearer .
 Early Futurist fashion could run light : The Modernist designer Sonia Delaunay ’ s “ simultaneous ” dress were floor-length gown made from variable fabric swatch that the artist began making in 1913 , all geometric patchwork of vibrating color combination — green and gold , red and pink — that resembled a walking Cubist painting . Futurism could also be dark , such a the metal bustier-like chest plate worn by Brigitte Helm a the Maschinenmensch in Fritz Lang ’ s classic 1927 film about dystopian class struggle , “ Metropolis. ” It could also be simply utilitarian : In 1919 , the Futurist artist and fashion designer Ernesto Michahelles , otherwise known a Thayaht , introduced a commercially successful unisex jumpsuit called the TuTa , from the Italian word “ tutta ” ( meaning “ all ” ) . ( Thayaht also worked for Vionnet , the creator of the bias-cut dress , with it emphasis on the movement of the body . ) It ’ s not so great a leap from the TuTa to Carhartt overall or even Yeezy Calabasas sweat , but a Futurism took hold of the 20th-century imagination , it would become le about functionality or technological innovation than our romance with the notion of the future itself : a fantasy of tomorrow for today .
 Though the formal movement itself ended , it obsession endured . In the 1960s , space-age designer like André Courrèges and Paco Rabanne were inspired by the aesthetic of satellite and rocket , resulting in sleek , shimmering minidresses for an era of youthful rebellion . In the 1980s , Thierry Mugler and Jean Paul Gaultier , among others , designed clothes for a new generation of cyberpunk supervixens , inspired by film like “ Blade Runner ” and “ Tron ” : a darker , computer-age sexiness that gave u bold shoulder , body-con everything and transparent trench coat . The early aught found retro-futurism at it most edgily gossamer in Nicolas Ghesquière ’ s brilliant collection for Balenciaga , including floral dress with the shape of Jane Jetson ’ s evening wear , segmented leather pant and gilded legging that called to mind “ Star Wars ” Stormtroopers or maybe C-3PO ’ s girlfriend . These were clothes infused with the optimism of a new millennium and the birth of the digital age : Androids could be lovely , too . All of these dream of the future , with their built-in expiration date , have become visual touchstone in their own right , in turn inspiring subsequent designer — exactly the kind of system of historical precedent the original , anti-nostalgia Futurists , with their fixation on the “ shock of the new , ” would have shunned .
 Now that it can feel perilous to look ahead , the fact that contemporary designer are venturing back to the future is more fraught than it wa . Ghesquière ’ s spring 2019 collection for Louis Vuitton wa almost quixotically upbeat , featuring floral jacquard flight suit , sci-fi print of potassium lake shot by drone and astronaut sleeve . Gucci ’ s Alessandro Michele referred to the feminist scholar Donna Haraway ’ s landmark 1984 text , “ A Cyborg Manifesto , ” in his fall 2018 show , in which model carried 3-D print of their own head . There were fabulous holographic pant at Balmain ’ s fall 2018 collection . With the exception of the hazmat suit and balaclava at the fall 2018 Calvin Klein 205W39NYC show , it felt more or le a though fashion had taken a vow of innocence rather than confront the reality of climate change report and border wall , presenting u not with an actual vision of the future but rather a longing for a time in which we still could feel hopeful about it . Fashion is , perhaps , not the place for a reckoning , and it never pay to be a literalist . Dystopia is a drag . But those of u wishing for a stimulating , thought-through vision of our present moment might wonder : Is this what we ’ ll be wearing after we locate the wormhole , or when a SpaceX rocket jettisons the human race en masse to Mars ? Will there be nightclub in our terraformed colony in which to wear the excellent sequined mesh dress ? The problem with breaking down “ the mysterious door of the impossible ” is that right now , no one really want to think too hard about what ’ s on the other side .
 FASHION IS A TERRIFIC time-travel machine . There is a kind of optimism built into the industry that make the future a recurring theme , a kind of sustained argument that there will always be people who need to make a statement with what they wear . But one of it curious paradox is the way in which it can remix the past , or the past ’ s unique vision of the future , to create something that feel resonantly of the moment . Our current moment ha resulted in what one might call an extended spell of beautiful eclecticism , a temporal salad of past and future past . Instead of a coherent reflection of the now , we have an assortment of potent , deeply coded nostalgia : a kind of choose-our-own-era pastiche for troubled time . How , one wonder , can this be a way forward ? Nothing and everything is anachronism ; nothing and everything look “ vintage. ” This is what we wear , one might think while looking at the collection of recent year , a we watch the world spinning gently out of time .
 Visions of future past always feel almost willfully innocent in retrospect . It ’ s not unlike the feeling of opening an old box and discovering one ’ s first-grade class photo , when you still thought you ’ d become an astronaut or win a Nobel Prize . But then , the retro-future is powerful precisely because it reveals to u the faultiness of those dream , the seductive gap between our fantasy of what we thought the future should look like and what it turned out to be . A replicator should be delivering our meal by now , not Postmates ; we should be getting around town by jet pack , not Segway . It ’ s hard to look back at the midcentury ’ s miniskirted sexual ebullience knowing that , a decade later , the Equal Rights Amendment would fail and , shortly after that , AIDS would wipe out entire community . And remember all of the people who , a recently a 10 year ago , thought that the internet would save democracy ?
 Wishful thinking is a powerful human instinct . In Gene Roddenberry ’ s sweetly utopian original “ Star Trek , ” which ran from 1966 to ’ 69 but wa set in 2265 to 2269 , the division of race and class didn ’ t exist , nor did sexual harassment . Lieutenant Uhura and Captain Kirk — who would share the first televised interracial kiss , albeit under the influence of telekinesis — worked together in an atmosphere of professionalism and mutual respect . Her uniform a the starship ’ s communication officer : red micro-miniskirt . ( Less sunny cinematic vision of the future tended to come from Europeans who grew up in the aftermath of two apocalyptic war , like Andrei Tarkovsky and Chris Marker . ) By the end of the 1960s , this vision of peace-and-love grooviness didn ’ t hold up ; Vietnam raged on , and the mod no longer seemed revolutionary but campy : a glittery sex-kitten wardrobe to be inflicted upon Jane Fonda in “ Barbarella ” ( 1968 ) , in which the titular character come from an idyllic Earth of the future , a place where war doesn ’ t exist . Then the 1970s arrived and with it the woman ’ s movement ; there were actual dark power to be fought on the home front and in the professional sphere , and no one wanted to wear a silver lamé bra and bootee while doing it .
 But that ’ s the funny thing about the future : Just when you think you ’ ve got it figured out , it sprint away , leaving u and our dream behind . Who could have foreseen then that , in the 21st century , progress wouldn ’ t be about free love but about sharing story of oppression ? What would Uhura have to say about identity politics ? We don ’ t know if this is fashion ’ s last gasp of radiant optimism : There very well may be intergalactic peace and equality in the 23rd century . Perhaps woman will occupy the majority of seat of power in the United Federation of Planets . Or maybe we ’ ll still be here on Earth , in our UPF-fabric toga and full-body neoprene : a vision not so unlike that of the young French designer Marine Serre , whose idea of an evening look , a shown in her spring 2019 show , is a sheer scuba suit worn under a luxe scavenger dress made of upcycled silk scarf . Which , come to think of it , might not be a bad thing to be wearing when the sea lap at our door .

 It ’ s hard to blame Matthew Wiley for suspecting Valentina Marie Lomborg wa telling whopper when he met her in 2017 at a Starbucks in Clearwater , Fla .
 Not only did she claim to be a former Los Angeles fashion model who socialized with celebrity , she also said she wa psychic .
 His credulity didn ’ t reach it limit , though , until after they exchanged number and went on a handful of date . As Mr. Wiley got to know Ms. Lomborg , she told him she wa fluent in four language , had lived in the wild of Alaska for year a a child , wa homeless for a time and wa being visited regularly by Hollywood chum who flew in for help contacting their deceased loved one .
 “ I wa like , no no no , ” said Mr. Wiley , 43 , a quality manager for an engineering company in Clearwater . “ Those thing could not happen . ”
 He ha since abandoned those doubt .
 Ms. Lomborg , 53 , moved to Clearwater three year ago . Before starting her business , Psychic Medium Valentina , she wa indeed a Los Angeles model who posed for magazine including Jet and Essence and catalog such a Frederick ’ s of Hollywood . She also appeared in television show and movie , among them “ In Living Color , ” “ The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air ” and “ Dumb & Dumber. ” Her role were mostly uncredited , and of the sexy babe variety .
 Before her modeling career took off , she had already learned to speak Danish , Swiss German , English and Inupiaq , an Eskimo language , the result of a peripatetic youth . She wa born in Denmark and lived there until age 6 . Then she and her mother , Hjordis Lomborg , moved to Switzerland . A few year later , her mother , who had divorced Ms. Lomborg ’ s father , married the man she considers her father , David Parkinson . They moved to Alaska , where she learned the other two language .
 “ I wa 8 and thrown in there at the top of the world in subzero temperature with 4,000 Eskimos who had never seen a brown person , ” Ms. Lomborg said . She finished high school there but never fully acclimated . As soon a she wa old enough , she moved to California .
 “ I wa 19 and I basically up and left my family , ” Ms. Lomborg said . Her goal wa to become a musician , she said , the next Blondie or Madonna . Instead , she lived briefly on the street of Santa Cruz , Calif. , where she said she survived on broken cooky supplied by a sympathetic bakery owner .
 By the early 1990s , her dream of pop stardom were replaced by plan to become a top model . She already had cover girl bona fides : As a toddler in Denmark , she posed for several issue of the woman ’ s magazine Femina . In Los Angeles , “ I got signed to the first agent I met , Irena Kamal , who represented a lot of Playboy model , ” she said . Work poured in . “ Everyone really believed in me . ”
 Ms. Lomborg ’ s natural beauty , which earned her a living a a model well into her 40 , wasn ’ t matched with robust health . In 1991 , when she wa 24 , she suffered a brain injury after she said she wa in an altercation that led to her being pushed headfirst onto concrete .
 The recovery wa slow : “ A year and a half of hell. ” But during that time , she felt a first connection to the spirit world . “ I could sense illness and death in people . It wa frightening . I just sort of pushed it aside and went back to modeling . ”
 In 1994 , she had a son , Seven . In 2000 , she got married , a union that lasted 11 year . Throughout those year , the feeling that her brain injury had opened a connection to the supernatural lingered . A year before her marriage ended , she became curious about the paranormal . “ That ’ s when I got good at talking to ghost , ” she said .
 She claim she ha been talking to them ever since , particularly the ghost of her mother , who died in 2015 of congestive heart failure in California , two week after her stepfather died of the same condition . ( Ms. Lomborg never reconciled with her biological father . )
 Ms. Lomborg belief she would not have landed in Florida or met Mr. Wiley if it wasn ’ t for her otherworldly communication with her mother . “ She basically told me , if you ’ re going to channel people , then do it to help others , ” she said . “ I told her , you ’ ve got to send me somebody to help me . I need a soul mate . ”
 Los Angeles no longer seemed the place to find one . “ I had no family , and I wa kind of done with modeling . I said to myself , Let ’ s wrap this whole thing up and pick a brand-new city , ” she said . She grabbed her cat , Lyra , and pointed a U-Haul toward Clearwater , a place that looked pretty in Google Images , while Seven stayed behind in California ( he ha since moved to Clearwater ) . By the end of the year she had set up an apartment and her psychic business .
 She also started making friend , including a neighbor , Debbie Good . When Ms. Lomborg wasn ’ t seeing client hoping to reach deceased loved one , she and Ms. Good solidified their friendship over regular meeting for coffee at a nearby Starbucks .
 Mr. Wiley is not sure what drew him to the Starbucks on Gulf to Bay Boulevard on the morning of May 24 , 2017 . Normally , he picked up his coffee at a different Clearwater Starbucks . Ms. Lomborg , meanwhile , wasn ’ t sure why she wa in a hurry that morning to catch up with Ms. Good over latte .
 “ I wa texting Debbie , ‘ Hurry up ! Let ’ s go ! ’ But normally I ’ m the one who ’ s late , ” Ms. Lomborg said .
 Mr. Wiley wa about to leave the store holding his usual venti cup before Ms. Lomborg and Ms. Good arrived . Then his phone rang . “ That call ended up lasting 45 minute , ” he said . “ It wa fate . It delayed me. ” When he hung up , he got in line for a refill and noticed Ms. Lomborg looking his way .
 “ I saw this beautiful woman with this huge smile , and I thought , ‘ Who ’ s she smiling at ? ’ Then I realized I wa the only guy in line , ” said Mr. Wiley , who wa divorced in 2007 and ha three child , Elijah , Maya and Cairo , who live in California .
 A few yard away at the counter , Ms. Good wa preparing to clear out so Ms. Lomborg would appear more approachable . “ V whispered to me , if I pick up my cup , that mean that cute guy in line is coming over here , ” said Ms. Good . “ Sure enough , she picked up her cup . I grabbed my phone and walked away so they could talk . ”
 An hour and a half later , they were still talking . Ms. Good , who wa pretending to take picture in the parking lot all that time , eventually grew impatient and came in to retrieve her car key . She sensed , instantly , that her friend had found a soul mate .
 “ V had been in several failed relationship , and it wa clear to me that the people she wa meeting in Clearwater were inappropriate , ” said Ms. Good , who had been hearing regularly about Ms. Lomborg ’ s local dating adventure . “ The men she wa going out with were unreliable , or rude , or dismissive . There wa something really different about how she wa interacting with Matt . I could feel it . ”
 Deepening the groove of Ms. Lomborg and Mr. Wiley ’ s instant connection were a series of coincidence they uncovered . Mr. Wiley wa born in Alaska and raised in California , for example , before moving to Florida a a teenager . Both are vegetarian . And he had just told his best friend , Eric Paongo , that he would like to meet an ethnically diverse woman whose zodiac sign wa Aquarius because Aquarians are a good match for Libras , his sign . Ms. Lomborg is an Aquarius . Then there wa the No . 5 he had tattooed on his shoulder , a nod to his quintet of best friend .
 “ I would always joke that it would be great if people had a number stamped on their forehead so you could identify them a your person , because I kept meeting the wrong guy , ” Ms. Lomborg said . Mr. Wiley happened to be wearing a shoulder-baring tank at Starbucks . “ I saw the No . 5 on his shoulder and I thought , close enough . ”
 By the time they left Starbucks , Mr. Wiley , who had consumed three venti coffee , wa so intrigued by Ms. Lomborg he texted her from the bathroom . And even though her history seemed unlikely and he wasn ’ t entirely sure about the supernatural , he sensed her belief were genuine . Within week , he too began believing . “ I know it ’ s weird , but her mom is definitely a presence in her apartment . I could just feel her there , ” he said .
 A month later , he wa comfortable enough with the late Mrs. Lomborg ’ s presence to move in to Ms. Lomborg ’ s apartment . A difficult adjustment ensued . Not because of their spectral roommate .
 “ I ’ m one of eight kid from a very frugal household , and V is an only child , ” Mr. Wiley said . “ Onetime I had some of her cereal , and she said , ‘ That ’ s my cereal ! ’ I had to tell her , share ! ”
 Ms. Lomborg admits she needed a sharing refresher course . “ I really wasn ’ t used to it , ” she said . “ Matthew taught me how to compromise . ”
 In May 2018 , Ms. Lomborg and Mr. Wiley flew to St. Lucia for a vacation . Mr. Wiley had told Ms. Good a few month earlier , in confidence , that he wanted to marry Ms. Lomborg . Around the same time , Ms. Lomborg also confided in Ms. Good .
 “ V said , ‘ Why hasn ’ t he proposed ? Maybe he doesn ’ t love me . Maybe he doesn ’ t trust me. ’ I had to bite my tongue , ” Ms. Good said .
 Ms. Lomborg wa able to set her worry aside in St. Lucia , at the site of one of her favorite episode of “ The Bachelor , ” the Jade Mountain Resort . After a volcanic mud bath , she and Mr. Wiley went for a walk on the beach , where they found a hammock to climb into .
 “ Then Matthew all of a sudden say , I have a poem I want to read you , and he jump out of the hammock , ” Ms. Lomborg said . She swiveled to sit up , foot in the sand , a he read . At the final handwritten verse , he dropped to one knee and presented a diamond engagement ring . “ Stay with me and tell me true/Love will you marry me ? , ” he recited .
 The evening had been cloudy , but both swear the cloud dissipated the moment Ms. Lomborg said yes . “ Every single star wa all of a sudden shining down on u in full brightness , and I felt the approval of my mother and father , ” Ms. Lomborg said .
 On Jan. 5 , Ms. Lomborg and Mr. Wiley were married before 65 guest at the Earthscapes Garden Room in Palm Harbor in a star-themed outdoor wedding , a nod to their belief in astrology and the coffee chain that united them . Bonnie Sanchez , a minister through the American Marriage Ministries , officiated .
 Ms. Lomborg , in a long champagne gown with sequin meant to mimic the star ’ twinkling , walked down an aisle flanked by tropical tree and plant , alone , to the “ Star Wars ” theme . Two attendant , a best friend from Florida , Hazen Witemeyer , and a best friend from Los Angeles , the fitness guru Ana Caban , wore flowing purple ombre gown and sneaker while clutching lavender rose bouquet .
 Mr. Wiley , in a glittering purple sport coat with black Puma sneaker , wa attended by Mr. Paongo and his older brother , Aaron Wiley , in black suit with lavender vest . Ms. Sanchez read several short blessing , the first a traditional Bahai passage in a nod to Mr. Wiley ’ s religion , the next a Buddhist blessing representing Ms. Lomborg ’ s faith . After a sage cleansing and a moment dedicated to gazing up , hand raised , to the universe , Ms. Sanchez finished the ceremony with a Viking prayer , recalling Ms. Lomborg ’ s Danish heritage .
 She had already summed up the chain of event that brought the assembled together on a clear but chilly Florida night : “ As we all know , the star and Starbucks aligned for Matthew and Valentina , ” she said .

 The writer-actress behind the wild , disorienting comedy of “ Fleabag ” and “ Killing Eve ” is bringing her sneak-attack humor to New York .
 Phoebe Waller-Bridge writes and star in work that is strange , beguiling and funny.CreditCreditAna Cuba for The New York Times

 LONDON — It ’ s really not funny , but Phoebe Waller-Bridge can ’ t help it . She is re-enacting this YouTube video of a psychopath sitting dead-eyed in her prison uniform and recounting how she killed a man . When Ms. Waller-Bridge get to the detail — the woman drove a nail through her victim ’ s skull , strangled him and chopped his body to bit — she laugh , and then she sigh : “ Terrible ! ”
 Ms. Waller-Bridge , a writer and star of strange and beguiling comedic work , is tucked into a red leather booth in the lobby bar of the Soho Theater , eating a browning banana and searching for little opening to laugh about just about anything . She describes something she once did a “ hilarious , ” and then laugh at herself for thinking she is so funny . She tell me that she love staring into the eyeball of a live audience , but that on TV it ’ s like she ’ s acting for just one big shiny eyeball , and then she laugh because she ’ s suddenly become hyper-aware of my eyeball .
 She talk like a one-woman band , always pulling some strange new sound effect out of her body . She is 33 year old and just under 6 foot tall , and when she is paired on screen with men , she must deflate herself — “ PFFFST ” — to let them seem big . When she laugh , her voice open into an off-kilter melody , a if her throat ha recently taken up the xylophone . If you ever have the opportunity to make her laugh — it ’ s not hard — it will feel like she ’ s thrown her head back and released a song just for you .
 Her one-woman play , “ Fleabag , ” hit the Edinburgh Festival Fringe with such force in 2013 that it left a smoldering Phoebe-shaped crater in the comedy landscape . Almost instantly , she wa enlisted to adapt “ Fleabag ” for TV , create and star in another sitcom , write a weirdly funny murder show , and ultimately ascend to the “ Star Wars ” universe , playing a mouthy droid programmed to deliver “ Solo ” some comic relief .
 She is so good at making people laugh that her facility for pathos can sneak up on them . While her audience are distracted by sparkling punch line , she is secretly messing around in the dark reach of their psyche . Vicky Jones , the director of “ Fleabag ” the play and Ms. Waller-Bridge ’ s best friend , warns that she can make you laugh so hard that when she swivel to punch you in the gut , “ you ’ re not braced for the impact , and it ’ s a killer . ”
 The sneak attack ha become Ms. Waller-Bridge ’ s creative signature . “ Fleabag , ” which she will soon take to the Soho Playhouse in New York , is a sex comedy that is secretly a tragedy . The title character is a cafe-owning singleton who is always arching a flirty eyebrow at the audience , but her charming mug is a mask — a way to hide her grief and shame in the wake of her best friend ’ s death . Ms. Waller-Bridge created a modern heroine and deconstructed her at once .
 “ Fleabag ” is the kind of early career success that risk swallowing it creator whole . As soon a she made it , she wondered : “ Was that it ? ” Then she charted her next move . When she pick up the character again , for the New York run , she say it will be for the last time . She now know the role so well that it ’ s just a matter of correctly shuffling the emotional cue : “ Don ’ t forget ! Pain here ! Funny there ! ”

 TWO STORIES UP , in the London theater ’ s black-box space , someone ha hauled out the original “ Fleabag ” set , the scruffy little pink-and-beige carpeted platform from which Ms. Waller-Bridge leapt to international fame . She will rehearse here for just a week with Ms. Jones before heading to New York . “ Fleabag ” is her and a bar stool , on which she spends most of the show . “ There is a small moment of exertion where I stand up toward the end , ” she say , when Fleabag ’ s pain finally emerges in a burst of emotional vomit . She heave into a delicately cupped palm : “ HEUGHHH . ”
 Before she brought “ Fleabag ” here , she staged the material that would later become “ Crashing , ” a flat-share sitcom that is secretly a meditation on repression . One level down is the theater ’ s main stage , where she had her first real acting job — the first one , anyway , where the audience wa not gobbling meat pie — playing a trader in 2009 ’ s “ Roaring Trade . ”
 Every night the cast would march from stage to bar , where , year later , she ’ d meet with BBC executive about taking “ Fleabag ” to television . Around the corner is where she had a falafel with Luke Jennings , the author of the novella she would adapt into “ Killing Eve , ” a spy thriller that is secretly a screwball romance between an intelligence operative and a psychopathic assassin . Down the street is her alma mater , the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art , the acting school that secretly taught her she should be a writer .
 She went there because she wanted to put on play , but for the first couple of year her course did not involve working with actual word , and she grew desperate for them . Her internal monologue wa a drumbeat : “ Give me a script , give me a script. ” Instead , she wa assigned self-indulgent acting exercise like : pair up and pretend to be animal for several month . She wanted to be a bat , but she couldn ’ t find anyone to be a bat with her , so she joined a pair of panther , stalking the hall on all four and licking sensually at their paw . It ’ s been a little bit like that all her life . “ I ’ ve always wanted to be a bat , ” she say , “ but I ’ m expected to be a panther . ”
 When she graduated in 2006 , she assumed that “ being posh with curly hair basically equal a Shakespearean career , ” a she once joked to British Vogue , but instead she struggled to get any work at all .
 Then she found her fellow bat . Ms. Jones wa directing a play featuring Ms. Waller-Bridge ’ s boyfriend at the time , and afterward Ms. Waller-Bridge approached her , flattered her and handed her a gaunt résumé . Ms. Jones wa “ blown away by this beauty who wa being so nice to me , ” she say , and when they worked together on a play of their own , Ms. Jones wa startled by her wild and unpredictable acting choice . She gave her a nickname : Brando .
 Soon the actress and the director had teamed up to form a theater company , DryWrite , staging guerrilla theater night that challenged writer to provoke audience : make them fight or make them fall in love . One night , designed to incite a battle of the sex , produced a raft of submission that were so bleakly misogynistic that they finally moved Ms. Waller-Bridge to write a script of her own .
 In it , she played a woman who somberly explains to her boyfriend that though she love him very much , she must occasionally have sex with a man with a massive penis , and that every other woman feel the same . The crowd , she say , became a mob : “ Everyone wa like , WRREUUGHH ! ”
 Her early work is sprinkled with note from her relationship with Ms. Jones . They would spend night sharing a bottle of wine and playing a terrifyingly intimate game they called “ truth song , ” where Ms. Waller-Bridge would pluck out a melody on her ukulele and every word they sang wa required to be the absolute truth .
 Later Ms. Waller-Bridge gave the game to Lulu , the character she played in “ Crashing , ” and what is remarkable is how she take a sweet memory and curdles it into something awful for the purpose of the story . Lulu , a kind of proto-Fleabag , us truth song to wreak havoc among her housemate , and the ukulele she cart around like a personality isn ’ t cute . It ’ s infuriating .
 Though she conceived “ Crashing ” in her early 20 , it did not air until she wa 30 year old , just month before “ Fleabag ” hit TV . By anyone else ’ s standard , it wa a remarkable television debut , but for her , backward motion is a kind of torture . She is always working to keep one step ahead of her audience . When she is out with Ms. Jones at movie or play , she ha this annoying habit of turning to her friend and whispering precisely what ’ s about to happen next . Ms. Waller-Bridge construct her own story to be “ Phoebe-proof , ” Ms. Jones say , which make them “ most-people-proof . ”
 Ms. Waller-Bridge work instinctively , prying open new possibility and savagely deleting existing plot and character a she go . She often consults Ms. Jones , who say that she is “ such a perfectionist that it is terrifying. ” She regularly chuck out early draft that blow Ms. Jones away . ( Ms. Waller-Bridge ha said that she is somewhat le inclined to show her work to her boyfriend , the playwright and director Martin McDonagh ) .
 Her ad hoc process can be a challenge in television , where she ha team of writer working beneath her . Writers may tell her about a scene they wrote that they really loved , and she ’ ll have to inform them : “ Ooh , that person died , I ’ m really sorry . I killed that person . ”
 She view casting a the secret second half of the writing process , a if her word aren ’ t inked until they come out of the actor ’ s mouth . The final scene of the first season of “ Killing Eve , ” in which the unlikely spy Eve stab the master assassin Villanelle , wa worked out in Ms. Waller-Bridge ’ s mother ’ s kitchen . Sandra Oh , who play Eve , seized a pencil and jumped on Ms. Waller-Bridge , and they tussled until they lit upon the precise psychosexual energy of the act . “ That ’ s how the moment came , ” Ms. Oh say . “ Not discussing it over wine . ”
 Though she is in demand a both a writer and an actress , Ms. Waller-Bridge ha no interest in making a star vehicle for herself . She initially considered staking out a role on “ Killing Eve , ” but she wrote herself out of the story almost by accident . In the novella , both Villanelle and Eve are in their late 20 , but she made Villanelle an early-20s angel-faced psycho and Eve a 40-something woman with “ a big bag and stress eye , ” leaving a perfect gap for Ms. Waller-Bridge herself , who wa then “ 30 year old and not bendy at all . ”
 Another secretly brilliant move : disappearing into a writing project just a her face wa hitting Hollywood billboard .

 WHEN MS. WALLER-BRIDGE leaf the Soho theater , she will fold herself into a cab and go put the final touch on the second season of the television “ Fleabag , ” a project that she passionately did not want to do . She had put all of this effort into building the perfect story arc for the first season , and now the BBC wanted her to twist it out of shape to make way for more content . “ I wa really proud of myself , having such artistic integrity , ” she say .
 But when the network asked her to reconsider , it planted a pesky idea in her brain . She began to think about the last thing that anyone would ever expect of Fleabag , and now the second season is about her finding faith . Ms. Waller-Bridge swears she will not do another one .
 Even she is not quite sure what will come next . Ms. Jones ’ s dream is to stage “ Hamlet ” with her friend a the prince ; Ms. Waller-Bridge want to write and direct a film . All she know is that when she brings “ Fleabag ” to New York , for a six-week run in a 178-seat theater that is nearly sold out , it will be to say goodbye to the character , and to put a punctuation mark on this phase of her life . “ We ’ ve had a ball , ” she say , “ but it ’ s time to move on . ”
 In her career , a in her plot , she is working to defy expectation . She sneak out of all of the box that people want to trap her in : the comedy writer , the sex writer , the feminist writer . When “ Fleabag ” came out , critic were fixated on how sexually explicit it wa , which is ironic because the sexual bravado is the character ’ s disguise , her way of preventing anyone from really seeing her .
 As soon a the entertainment industry sink it teeth into a smart young woman , it seems to want to extract her perspective and blast it into every possible market segment : the memoir slash manifesto , the newsletter , the body-positive Instagram account . After “ Fleabag , ” Ms. Waller-Bridge got load of those kind of offer . Instead of asking , “ What do you want to do next , a an artist ? ” they wanted to know : “ Could you spin that into a book ? ”
 It ’ s not enough for a woman to write a beloved television show , or three . “ It ’ s part of the job now , ” she say , “ to be a brilliantly articulate spokesperson for feminism. ” But she ’ s already poured her best insight into “ Fleabag , ” and she doesn ’ t see the point of cranking open the hood on her art and exposing all of it part .
 One time she cited Bret Easton Ellis a an inspiration in an interview , and when it caused a ripple of feminist backlash — how could she appreciate the work of a male chauvinist ? — she wa bewildered , like : “ Don ’ t attack me for reading. ” Actually , she find that misogyny invigorates her : “ It make me want to retaliate artistically , ” she say .
 Ms. Waller-Bridge relish writing moment where woman get thwacked , cartoon rake style , by the contradiction of feminism . But secretly , she is not interested in focusing on the thing that keep woman down . Her character aren ’ t entrapped in feminist controversy or pulverized by the patriarchy . “ They ’ re just getting on with it , ” she say . “ Funny , clever woman running the show. ” She is aspirational in this way , always pitching woman toward some strange , as-yet-unseen future . She just want to show them living their life a bat .

 The final season of “ Game of Thrones ” arrives April 14 . Before then , we ’ re getting prepared by rewatching the first seven season . Sign up to get these straight to your inbox .
 So now that you ’ ve rewatched Season 4 , do you need a drink ? Here , let u be your cupbearer . Read on for a deeper dive into the season . If you ’ re just joining u , you can catch up with recap of past season with our ultimate watching guide , which also includes suggested episode to rewatch in later season .
 House Lannister = House Loser . Thanks to all the family squabbling , the Lannisters overlooked real threat and ended up sacrificing each other , to the detriment of the Seven Kingdoms . House Arryn thought they were safe and the Eyrie impregnable — but they let Littlefinger waltz in and take the Vale for himself . House Martell lost their chance for revenge ( and we lost the best part of the Dorne story ) because Oberyn didn ’ t know when to just walk away .
 So , the winner ? House Baratheon . Stannis the Mannis is the only king looking to protect the realm , not just his own interest . Remember the realm , guy ?
 Tyrion isn ’ t the only poor soul in Westeros holding out for a hero — a champion to stand up and fight for him . What is Hodor , if not Bran ’ s champion ? ( Although not always voluntarily . ) Yara hope to become her brother Theon ’ s champion in order to save him from Ramsay ( too bad that Theon ha become Reek and can ’ t accept her rescue ) . And while both the Hound and Brienne deny any knight-like affiliation , they are unmistakably chivalrous — watching over a little orphan girl ( even if the little girl in question hardly need their help ) .
 Such heroism among humbler figure in this story point to the fact that those actually charged with protecting their people are generally selfish or feckless or both .
 When Tywin quiz Tommen ( “ What make a good king ? ” ) , they discus several necessary quality , but ultimately settle on wisdom , the crucial virtue for anyone seeking to rule over a kingdom filled with group pursuing hotly contested interest . However , Tywin doesn ’ t address the social contract between a monarch and his vassal — that in return for fealty , king and queen are accountable to their subject a protector of the realm . Tywin is aware of that responsibility , but he is more interested in using authority to advance his personal goal .
 In Meereen , Dany is driven le by calculation than extremist idea about justice . As she learns in the aftermath of Astapor and Yunkai , it ’ s not enough to liberate slave if their former master retain institutional power . So , enraged by the ghastly crucified slave child she see on the road , she executes all the master . “ They can live in my new world , or they can die in their old one , ” she say .
 But what exactly is Dany ’ s new world ? She ha replaced an oligarchy with an absolute monarchy , one with a judicial system defined by a lack of due process and disproportionate sentencing , a Hizdahr zo Loraq point out . His father , a critic of the child slave crucifixion , wa himself crucified . “ Is it justice to answer one crime with another ? ” Hizdahr asks , in regard to executing the master without questioning them first . Dany ’ s response ? That what she did wa no crime . She ’ s above the law because she is the law . That come awfully close to Joffrey ’ s assessment that the king can do what he like .
 It ’ s not like there are better model elsewhere . If you ’ re a lord or a lady accused of a crime in Westeros , the only way you can hire someone to defend you is in a trial by combat ; there are no lawyer in the courtroom of Westeros . Nor are there rule regarding conflict of interest among the three judge drawn from among your peer ( more lord ) . In Tyrion ’ s trial , Tommen recuses himself , presumably because he ’ s related to the accused , the accuser and the victim , but Tywin stay on .
 Outside of the king ’ s court , justice is even more arbitrary . The dissident burned by Stannis and Melisandre presumably received no trial before their execution . Littlefinger is suspected of murder and face a trial by two lord and one lady of the Vale , and half of their objection are that he ’ s an outsider ( Sansa ’ s testimony clear him ) . Jon Snow is also tried for a few crime — breaking his vow , murdering Qhorin Halfhand . But the Night ’ s Watch allows him to defend himself , and one judge on the bench decides he ’ s telling the truth ( good old Maester Aemon ) . That ’ s enough to stay an execution , to the dismay of Alliser Thorne , the acting Lord Commander .
 Westerosi law is more consistent in the area of property , inheritance , and succession — it privilege the powerful , not the common people .
 Again and again in Season 4 we were reminded that in such a fundamentally unjust world , the people need a new kind of champion . Not someone who ’ s trying to become king or queen in order to theoretically save the realm , but someone who ’ ll fight to save the realm first .
 Love story on “ Game of Thrones ” tend to end rather badly — your lover dying in your arm , or pushing you through the Moon Door , or strangling you with a golden chain . We talked to actor Sibel Kekilli about the sad standoff between Tyrion and Shae in Season 4 . ( Adapted from an earlier interview with Kekilli . )
 How did you find out about your character ’ s death ?
 Dan Weiss and David Benioff told me that my role would be slightly different from the original character in the book , a bit bigger . But a I hadn ’ t read the book at that point , I had no clue exactly what they meant . When I told some friend that I wa going to be in the show , they spoiled the whole thing for me , big-time . I actually thought they were going to kill me off at the end of Season 3 , so after reading the script for that season , I asked Dan and David if they had changed their mind and decided to put Shae on the throne at the end ? Unfortunately , their answer wa no . But they gave me the good news that my character would live for one more season . So at least that wa a nice surprise .
 What do you remember from your last day on set ?
 My last day on set wa actually the strangulation scene with Peter Dinklage , and I wa rather sad that my time on “ Game of Thrones ” had come to it end . But I thought it wa really kind that Dan and David came over from another set to watch me die .
 Did you read any of the fan reaction ?
 Unfortunately , I did once . Apparently people can be really mean these day , and some can ’ t differentiate between the fictional character and the real person . What bothered me the most wa the fact that people didn ’ t believe Shae wa really in love with Tyrion . But I ’ m happy that it also could be the other way around . I once met Barack Obama , and he just said , “ I am so sorry that they killed you off , ” with a big ironic smile . He wa very kind and charming . And George R.R . Martin told me that if he had known me earlier , he wouldn ’ t have me killed . He liked my Shae better than the one in the book .
 How did being on the show change your career ?
 It ’ s a bit crazy and scary at the same time . Sometimes I get recognized because of the show , even though it ha been a while since I have been on the series . Sometimes it ’ s really funny , because they think they know me from somewhere or have met me before . And if they find out that I played Shae in the show , they immediately say , “ Ah ! You betrayed Tyrion ! ”
 Who had your favorite death and why ?
 Viserys ’ s death wa very memorable , and it had such an impact . And sorry to say , Joffrey ’ s death wa very good — he wa a horrible king , and his death scene wa just magnificent .
 Jack Gleeson ( Joffrey Baratheon ) announced an early retirement from acting well before the death of the loathsome Joffrey , citing a need to focus on his study at Dublin ’ s Trinity College . Now , though , he ’ s easing his way back into show business a a member of the theater company Collapsing Horse , which produce show focused around comedy and puppetry .
 Pedro Pascal ( Oberyn Martell ) ha gone from busting Lannisters to building case against drug cartel in “ Narcos. ” Next , he ’ ll be playing a interplanetary gunfighter in the Star Wars TV series “ The Mandalorian . ”
 Charles Dance ( Tywin Lannister ) ha been very good about staying in touch with his old castmates . He appeared with his former “ Thrones ” daughter Lena Headey in “ Pride and Prejudice and Zombies , ” with the Khaleesi herself in “ Me Before You ” and with the Red Wedding groom in “ Underworld : Blood Wars. ” He even played the father of Conleth Hill ( who played Varys ) in the British sitcom “ Hang Ups . ”
 Rose Leslie ( Ygritte ) fight only courtroom battle these day in her role a the young lawyer Maia Rindell on the “ The Good Wife ” spinoff “ The Good Fight . ”

 There were several departure from the Song of Ice and Fire book in Season 4 , the most controversial being that in the show , Jaime and Cersei attend the funeral for their dead son . After a furor erupted , the show ’ s creator and cast then gave everyone whiplash trying to explain it .
 The book are divided into point-of-view chapter , and this particular juncture in “ A Storm of Swords ” is told from Jaime ’ s perspective . He ha just returned to King ’ s Landing from his stint a a prisoner-of-war and discovers his son/nephew Joffrey is dead . Alone in the sept with Joffrey ’ s corpse , he and Cersei comfort one another with kiss and caress . Cersei ’ s receptive , but she object , weakly , when Jaime start kissing her neck . “ No , ” she say . “ Not here . The septons … ” But Jaime kiss her again , until she moan . Then he knock the candle off the altar and lift Cersei up onto it . Next , she pound on Jaime ’ s chest , “ murmuring about the risk , the danger , about their father , about the septons , about the wrath of god . ”
 This could be interpreted a a no , except that after Jaime start having sex with Cersei , she begin whispering word that indicate assent ( including the actual word “ yes ” ) : “ Yes , my brother , sweet brother , yes , like that , yes , I have you , you ’ re home now , you ’ re home now , you ’ re home . ”
 It ’ s clear that Cersei ’ s initial objection were to the holy location — the Sept of Baelor — and to the presence of her dead son ’ s body . She reciprocates and consent to be roughly ravished , even if her consent is complicated . As author George R.R . Martin say , “ Though the time and place is wildly inappropriate and Cersei is fearful of discovery , she is a hungry for him a he is for her . ”
 In the show , the circumstance are different . Jaime ha been back in King ’ s Landing for a while and Cersei ha been standoffish , telling him he ’ s been gone too long . The dialogue in the sex scene is different : We get her initial no , but not her later yes . She ’ s at first receptive to a kiss , but then pull away . “ You ’ re a hateful woman , ” Jaime angrily tell her . “ Why have the god made me love a hateful woman ? ” He grab at her and start tearing at her clothes . “ Jaime , not here , please , ” Cersei say . “ Please . Stop it . Stop it . Stop . No . Stop it . Stop . Stop . Stop . It ’ s not right . It ’ s not right . Don ’ t . Don ’ t. ” That ’ s an awful lot of flat-out no .
 Viewers and critic were disturbed and outraged by this scene , and there wa much debate about whether what we saw wa a rape . Some observer were unequivocal , sure that it wa ; others were confused by the ambiguous blocking and shot choice ; and some thought — what the hey — Jaime wa justified in taking what he wanted , however roughly .
 Pressed for clarification , the show ’ s producer , the episode ’ s director and the actor themselves sent out mixed message , publicly disagreeing with one another and even contradicting themselves about the intention of the scene . The director Alex Graves claimed at first that it wa intended to look consensual . “ It becomes consensual by the end , ” he said in an interview with Hitfix , “ because anything for them ultimately result in a turn-on , especially a power struggle. ” In another interview , with Vulture , he attempted to clarify : “ The big thing to u that were so important , and that hopefully were not missed , is that before he rip her undergarment , she ’ s way into kissing him back . She ’ s kissing him aplenty . ”
 Graves then turned around and told the Hollywood Reporter that it wa rape . Then during the “ Inside the Episode ” featurette , the showrunner David Benioff said the sex wa forced : “ She ’ s saying no , and he ’ s forcing himself on her. ” The actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau claimed that what we saw wa both rape and not-rape . “ It took me awhile to wrap my head around it , ” he told the Daily Beast , “ because I think that , for some people it ’ s just going to look like rape . The intention is that it ’ s not just that … There are moment where she give in , and moment where she push him away . ”
 This confusion regarding a fictional rape came at a time when Americans were grappling with defining what constitutes consent and coercion in real life , especially in regard to a few high profile case . ( Emma Sulkowicz started carrying her mattress around Columbia University that year . )
 Whether or not “ Game of Thrones ” intended Cersei to be raped by her brother/lover , the issue wa dropped after this episode — we see no subsequent recrimination between Cersei and Jaime for the rest of Season 4 . Which would be strange , if it had been rape , because Cersei would seem to be the last sort of person to let such a thing slide . Instead she simply tell Tywin about their incest and then return to Jaime and vow her everlasting love . Hmmm .
 Part of the viewer outrage that erupted around this scene wa more plot-focused . It seemed to reverse the narrative direction of Jamie being on a redemption arc . People were just starting to like Jaime and they felt betrayed . Very few of the fan so concerned about Jaime ’ s narrative arc had a much to say about Cersei ’ s .
 There have of course been ongoing objection to the sexual politics of Westeros — a place where woman are repeatedly threatened with rape and in fact are raped quite a lot . What could be the reason for turning an instance of consensual sex in the book into what appears to be yet another rape in the show ? Answer still awaited .
 You have more lingering question !
 I have confusion over Daenerys ’ provenance . She say her father wa the Mad King , yet we know that Elia Martell wa the Mad King ’ s wife , had two child with him , and all three of them were murdered by the Mountain . So who wa Dany ’ s mother ? It ’ s suggested that Dany is Jon Snow ’ s “ aunt ” or something like that , but if her father wa the Mad King , and Jon ’ s father wa the Mad King , too , then they are half sibling , with the same father . So what ’ s the real story ? Help ! — Roberta Smoodin
 I ’ ve been grappling with Jon ’ s lineage for a while . I don ’ t buy that he ’ s a Targaryen . His hair give ample evidence that he could be Robert Baratheon ’ s son . Why did George R.R . Martin go to such great length regarding hair color a it pertains to lineage just to abandon it now ? How can Jon Snow with his curly black ( Baratheon-like ) hair come from a Targaryen ( white blonde ) and a Tully ( brown/red ) ? It doesn ’ t make sense . Also , now Jon would be Dany ’ s nephew ? — Susan Keating
 Let ’ s tackle these two lineage query together , and hopefully sort through the confusion before Jon and Dany continue the Targaryen family tradition of incest any further ! King Aerys II , the Mad King , wa Dany ’ s dad . But he wa not married to Elia Martell — he wa married to his own sister , Rhaella . Rhaella had three child — Rhaegar ( the crown prince ) , Viserys and then Dany — but died from complication during Dany ’ s birth . Rhaegar wa the one who married Elia Martell , and they had two child together , daughter Rhaenys and son Aegon . But Rhaegar abandoned Elia and the kid to run off with Lyanna Stark , with whom he had his third kid and her first .
 Rhaegar ( a Targaryen ) and Lyanna ( a Stark , not a Tully ) could have blonde or brunette kid , but the chance of white blonde wa slimmer than brunette since the lighter hair color is a recessive gene . In this case , the dominant gene ( darker hair ) won out , giving Jon more of the Stark coloring . ( “ The seed is strong. ” ) Although Lyanna wa betrothed to Robert before running off with Rhaegar , this wa not Robert ’ s baby . Rather , Lyanna made her brother Ned ( and Robert ’ s BF ) promise to protect the baby from Robert . “ If Robert find out , he ’ ll kill him . You know he will , ” she told Ned on her death bed a she , too , died from childbirth . The new regime would have to wipe out the Targaryen line . And so Ned changed the kid ’ s birth name ( Aegon Targaryen ) to a bastard name of the North ( Jon Snow ) and claimed him a his own . Jon is roughly nine month older than Dany , but she is his paternal aunt .

 Happy 2019 and welcome back to Current Events Conversation !
 Thank you to class from Beverly , Mass. , Danvers , Mass. , Hoggard High School and Silverton , Ore. , for getting u off to a strong start this year with excellent comment on living without a phone , making career choice , facing rejection and more .
 To kick off the new year , in addition to our most popular writing prompt of the week , we ’ re also including a special bonus look at student prediction for 2019 . We had so much fun reading them that we couldn ’ t not share them here .
 And though we usually only highlight comment from our writing prompt in this feature , this week we also want to acknowledge a class from Massachusetts , who left especially thoughtful response to our Article of the Day , “ Learning With : ‘ Heroin Addiction Explained : How Opioids Hijack the Brain. ’ ” As a student named Ilana wrote , “ I ’ ve been told time and time again that opioids are highly addictive . But , that is the only thing I ’ ve been told , leaving the crisis of addiction to seem non-applicable to me . I never understood why anyone would take them in the first place but this article shed on light on the ‘ euphoric first time ’ [ and ] help me understand the driving of force of their addiction . ”
 Finally , welcome to new class from Stevens Point , Wis. , and Warsaw , Poland . We ’ re so glad to have you .
 Please note : All student comment have been lightly edited for length , but otherwise appear exactly a they were originally submitted .

 At the beginning of every new year , we ask student to make prediction about the year ahead . What do they think will happen nationally , globally or locally ? What ’ s in store for technology , sport , culture , food , economics and politics ? What do they have to look forward to in their own life ?
 Only 10 student so far have told u what they think 2019 will hold , but we enjoyed both the range and the specificity so much we ’ re quoting much of what we got . How many of these do you agree with ?
 2019 , according to teenager
 donald trump will be impeached kansa city chief will win the super bowl 5G wifi is goint to be awesome fortnite will die off the mc rib with an extra rib will come back
 — Lucas , united state
 … This year Stanley Cup final will consist of the Tampa Bay Lightning defeating the Nashville Predators in 6 game .
 — Calvin Mansfield , Danvers , Mass .
 2019 will much like 2018 , with the same sort of soap opera-esque drama present in 2018 . Why should it be any different ? The same official are in the same office that they had been and since there are no upcoming election , they have no incentive to change anything .
 — Jake Hession , Hoggard High School , Wilmington , N.C .
 I predict in 2019 the fate of Trump ’ s border wall will be decided , there will be a lot of partisanship within Congress , there will be the beginning of another loud election cycle ( weird that is ha been almost 4 year since I read that Donald Trump wa running for president ) , Chinese smartphone company will overtake Apple , Pewdiepie will be overtaken by T-series ( he dodged a bullet , but still ha it coming ) , Avengers 4 will be a good movie , but it will prove difficult to live up to the giant hype , Kendrick Lamar will release another great album , Terminator 6 is either going to be a major letdown or it will re-vitialize the franchise ( either way it is going to be under a lot of pressure , the president in Brazil is going to persecute whoever he want , while I doubt that country is going to get safer ( maybe I ’ ll be wrong ) , and much much more .
 — Gregory A. , NY
 I think 2019 will be a year of major technological achievement . I think that electronic-based learning will become more dominate in school , expanding child ’ s knowledge of technology . I think our society will plunge deeper into mainstream social medium , disconnecting younger generation from physical connection with other people . I ’ m hoping the U.N. will take some major stride to help the refugee displaced due to the raging war in Syria . After recently watching a documentary on it , you can really see how in need these people are and how little attention they get . I believe that more country around the world will raise awareness to the rising problem in our world ’ s ocean . I believe that there will be more advance made in the productivity in driverless car , and in faster , easier transportation .
 I hope there will be more empathy and understanding of other people ’ s pain , and that 2019 will be a good year for all .

 In “ In Search of Lost Screen Time , ” Paul Greenberg writes that , in 2018 , Americans who owned mobile device spent a total of $ 1,380 and 1,460 hour on them . He wonder , if we were to forgo our smartphones in 2019 , what else could we do with that money and time ?
 We posed the question to student : Would they go a year without their phone ? Could they ? Commenters estimated that they spent anywhere from 30 minute to 7 hour on their phone each day . Some said they would gladly give up staring at their screen all the time . Others , though , weren ’ t so sure it could be done .
 My phone is part of my life
 I honestly could not go a year without my smartphone , even though I wish I could . I hate my phone and what it doe to my work ethic . It cause way too many distraction , causing me to either not do my work or forget about it …
 A main reason I could not go without my phone is because of communication . My parent like to use an app called Life360 that track where I am , so I need my phone with me at all times.I would be fine without social medium , it would be good for all of u , but it is one of the only way I keep track of my friend that go to different school , make new friend , and make plan .
 Homework is also why I could not go without my phone for a year . Sometimes I don ’ t always have my laptop with me , and so I do my work on my phone . I watch the video we have to watch for math on my phone rather than on my laptop because I find that I pay attention better since my phone isn ’ t sitting off to the side.I believe no one in today time could go without their phone for a year because now , smartphones are apart of everyone ’ s life , job , school , and parent all have apps for everything .
 — Evan Barefoot , Hoggard High School
 On the average I spend about 7 hour a day on my phone , I will text friend , play game and check my social medium . Could I go a year without my phone ? No , not at all . I wouldn ’ t know what ’ s going on , i wont be able to text my friend . My phone is what i use to talk to people because it hard for me to talk to someone about my feeling face to face . When I want to hangout with my friend i use my phone , when I ’ m done doing my chore I go on my phone , I use my phone for music on the bus , when i ’ m playing my PS3 , when i ’ m doing the dish , and many more stuff . My phone is part of my life .
 — Kiara2019 , Silverton
 I should spend le time on my phone , but …
 Personally I ’ d say I spend about 1-2 hour on my phone everyday . The majority of the time spent on my phone is on Social Media and Music apps . I think if I wasn ’ t exposed to social medium , and had another wa of listening to music , I could go a year without a smartphone …I do think this article persuades me to give up my phone for a year because it showed me all the good I could do for myself and the world . The best example given were the plant , purify , save , and heal . If I didn ’ t have a smartphone for a year , I would probably spend most of my time reading and growing my knowledge to do better in school and in life and going on adventure around the world .
 — Krystian30 , Silverton
 The benefit that my phone ha on my life is that I can easily get in touch with my friend and I can keep up with what ’ s going on with the world and other people life ’ s . Yes I think my phone doe have a negative impact on my life . I am a very stressful person and I have heard that your stress level go up when you use your smartphone . Also no amount of light hitting your eyeball 1 foot away is good for eye or your brain . I also tend to get really bad headache from looking at my phone took much and that ’ s a major problem . Lastly I love my phone and the connection I can get with my friend over it , but I do think I need to spend le time on my phone and enjoy another person company .
 — leialoha , silverton23
 I spend lot of time on my phone . On average maybe 30-40 hour per week . I am trying to cut down on the usage because I know I have more important stuff to do then just staring at my phone . When I heard what we could do to change this , I knew I needed to follow these …
 The benefit to not having a phone , ( from my experience ) is that you are in a better mood . You do more stuff with people and do more thing that are active and healthy for you . I think it ’ s good to drop your phone once in a while to be more open . Open to the world , open to more activity . You are happier when not staring at your phone , and you are more talkative to a person . I think in general we should drop our phone for a week , and just experiment with the fun .
 — Madison2019 , Silverton
 A year without a phone ? I could do it .
 The benefit my phone ha for my life is that I can stay connected with a lot of my peer around Oregon or my friend at my school . My phone keep me entertained and help me contact anyone at any time if it crucial or really important , it also keep me in reach with my parent so that they know where I am at all time .
 But , the negative affect my phone ha in my life is that it draw my attention so that whenever I have homework or something really important to do I don ’ t do it because I ’ m so focused on my phone . I make excuse that I don ’ t have time , but usually I roughly have 2 hour of free time to get all my homework done but instead I just go on my phone . Also , I do many sport and I always use the excuse that school is to hard or that sport are making it difficult but it really is just me choosing that my phone is more important than my education .
 So , yes I do think that I could go a year without my cellphone and that it would benefit me to get all the thing I need to get done so that I can be successful a I get higher and higher at school .
 — Melia , Silverton23
 I probably could go a year without my smartphone because I don ’ t use it that much . It benefit me because if my parent need to contact me or I want to reach my friend , I can with the smartphone . The disadvantage with it are mainly that I don ’ t pay attention to my surroundings when focused on the screen … If I were to spend a year without my phone I wouldn ’ t really miss it , considering most of my electronics time is spent on my laptop or console , rather then my phone . If I didn ’ t spend any time on electronics however I would probably spend more time with family .
 — Clayton , Silverton
 I only spend around 30 minute on my phone on a daily basis so most of the thing said in the article don ’ t really matter a much to me …I could go a year without my phone because i don ’ t really use it for anything but texting and if i needed i could just talk to people in person . If i didn ’ t have a phone i guess the positive side would be that i wouldn ’ t be tempted to look at a screen constantly .

 In “ Does It Pay to Be a Writer ? ” Concepción de León report that professional writing pay far le than it used to — barring many aspiring writer from pursuing their dream job . This sad news inspired u to ask student how important money is in their own career aspiration .
 The question revealed a deep philosophical split in teenage opinion : while some consider choosing a career just for the money to be a “ death sentence , ” others felt that blindly pursuing one ’ s passion wa “ no longer a viable life plan ” in today ’ s economy . Many , however , are planning ahead to try to have it all — a career they love that also earns enough to pay the bill .
 Get real and choose a career that earns a reasonable wage
 “ Do what you love ” is cute advice for after school activity and hobby , but when it come to finding a job , especially in today ’ s economy where real estate price and the cost of college is getting significantly higher , it becomes necessary to sacrifice a dream job ( like being an author ) to something with steady pay , even if you do not enjoy it a much .
 — Julie Kee , Danvers , Mass .
 While I personally revel in the practice of writing , I bar myself from entering a career a an author or journalist simply because it is no longer particularly financially lucrative a the Amazon business leviathan consolidates it hold over the publishing industry , and the influence of institution such a newspaper and magazine wane , a process detailed in Concepción de León ’ s article , “ Does it Pay to Be a Writer ? ” In short , career in creative sphere are no longer a viable life plan . While it is possible to achieve success , the probability of gaining true economic stability is dwindling .
 — Jake Hession , Hoggard High School , Wilmington , N.C .
 Our modern marketplace make it very difficult to pursue certain career , and insight like “ just do what you love ” teach nothing but how out of touch a lot of u still are about these issue .
 — Vanessa Ellis , Danvers , Mass .
 I would not choose to go in a career if it did not pay well , no matter how much I wa interested in it . Ultimately , the most efficient way to promote physical and mental well being is to have money - not in abundance , but a liveable salary is something hard to live without . I feel like the hassle of playing catch-up with bill , payment , etc. , would spoil the fun of the interest anyways , since it attracts so many hardship . When thinking about a career , the advice I would give is to think practically . Career advice typically includes something around “ following your passion ” or your interest . But , interest change drastically through time .
 — Emily Whalen , Massachusetts
 Do what you love
 A job should not just be for a source of income . Your career should give you a sense of fulfillment in what you are doing for the world . I know what I want to do and I am willing to put in my everything to get there . Are you willing ?
 — Madison Kelley , Danvers , Mass .
 In today ’ s world , not many adult really enjoy their occupation a a part of their “ lifestyle ” or even “ hobbie ” . Most of the time , these people are seen walking around miserably on the weekday , a they are solely focused on reaching the weekend .
 However , making not a lot of money come with sacrifice . I would not be able to live a luxuriously a maybe preferred . I might not be able to have my dream car , or dream house , or dream vacation . Nevertheless , all of these thing bought with large amount of money can only take you so far in life . A “ dream ” car can take you all the same place a mediocre car could , and a “ dream ” house is the same four wall and a roof that a mediocre house could provide . Also , a “ dream ” vacation only last for so long , until you must return home . My goal is to have my weekday be a enjoyable a my weekend because we only live for so long . If that mean not making a huge amount of money , so be it .
 — Gabriela Ferullo , Danvers , Mass .
 You don ’ t need money to be happy in life , you just need to do something that make you happy . That ’ s why people work lower-paying career despite having opportunity to easily make more money . Teachers are another prime example . No one would become a high school teacher based on the amount of money they ’ re going to make , yet there are still enough people who want to be teacher in the world that school can actually function . This is because people want to be teacher because they ’ re passionate about teaching . If I were offered two jobs—a job that I would love to do for low pay , and a job that I would absolutely hate for higher pay—I would take the former .
 — Jack Murray , Danvers , Mass .
 Waking up everyday to go to an average 9-5 job that I hate would be a death sentence . I ’ m only 17 year old , and I am a junior in high school . I really haven ’ t thought about money much in my life , so maybe it a little premature to say that I do not care about it much . However a I sit here an right this , I want to do what I love , and love what I do .
 — Tom Walfield , Danvers , Mass .
 I would rather live in a little hut on the water with only what I needed to live , go to work everyday that is something I love to do , and then go back to my little hut and surf .
 — Dan Rossitto , Danvers , Mass .
 I look at people who sit behind desk from 8-6 , five day a week , counting other people ’ s money , or creating advertisement , looking at a computer screen all day long . And some of them are happy , and like their job . But if I were offered a job like that , even if it were for triple my original salary , I would have to turn it down . We sit behind desk for sixteen or so year , why would anyone want to do that for the rest of their lives.If I ’ m not doing something I love , I don ’ t try a hard .
 — Madeline Butler , Danvers , Mass .
 Can ’ t you have both ?
 In my family , my single mother used to search endlessly for a job to provide for my sibling and I . Her current job wasn ’ t what she attended university for , but it would be enough for our home and necessity . Looking back at those time , I hope to find a career I love , but within reason . I have a wider scope of understanding that money need to be made , but I have hope that the field of journalism is still alive by the time I graduate . I fully intend to pursue what I love and is interesting to me : journalism . By reading this article I am faced with the reality that not everyone make it into The New York Times or uncovers a scandal like the Spotlight team in 2001 . There is still hope that I can write about the major story of our society and support myself and a future family .
 — Grace Donahue , Danvers , Mass .
 I hope to go to college to become a pediatric nurse . The salary of this job wa an important part in deciding this career choice . Working with child is something I am passionate about , but the nursing field wa chosen based on the salary . I want to be able to support myself and my potential family without struggle .
 — Casey Masterson , Danvers , Mass .
 Ever since I first started thinking about what I wanted my job to be when I get out of college , it wa always a mixture between what I want to do and how much I get paid for doing it .
 From an early age I ’ ve wanted to go into the medical field and a I got older my sight have been more focused on physical therapy . I knew that I wanted to be able to help people one way or another and physical therapy had seemed like the perfect fit for me . I want to be able to have a sustainable life while also being able to enjoy it at the same time . Overall , I don ’ t really think that there is a perfect job out there , but I do think that if you choose something that you ’ re good at , enjoy doing , and ha a good salary that ’ s fit for you , then you ’ ll be able to lead a good and happy life .

 In our most popular Picture Prompt of the week , “ Facing Rejection , ” we asked student to look at the illustration above and reflect on a time they were rejected or failed at something they had worked hard for . How did they handle it ? Like the person in the picture ? Or with a little more frustration ?
 They told u story of heartbreak , humiliation and , ultimately , resilience . Read on to see what advice they have for their future self and others on how to deal with rejection .
 Turn failure into fuel
 When I wa ten year old I fell in love with soccer . I worked hard and would look forward to every practice . When I wa ten though , during tryout the top ten girl would make an early travel team . This of course , became my big goal . I went to all three day and worked very hard , yet there wa some girl who only showed up to two , one , and some who didn ’ t even go . The coach in the end , picked them . I wa the eleventh pick . When my father told me this the day after thanksgiving I wa heartbroken . I had worked so hard and tried my best , how could girl who didn ’ t even come to tryout get in , and not me ?
 This wa when I learned just how strong rejection can make you . I ended up working even harder the next few year to prove that I should not have been the eleventh pick … Getting rejected when I wa young helped me become determined and pushed me to be a better player , a leader , and a better person . To my future self , turn the negative into fuel to do good thing and become better . Do not beat yourself up if you don ’ t have your best race , or your best test . Prove to others and to yourself that you are better than what others may believe .

 I have faced rejection before . I wa a little league baseball player when I wa younger and wanted to really badly make the all star team . Sadly , I wasn ’ t accepted to the team and I grew angry because I thought that I wa going to make the team for sure . It turn out that this rejection made me realize that hard work and dedication is what you need to put into something that you love to be good at it .
 A piece of advice that I would give somebody because of this would be If you think you are the best you could be then push yourself even harder because you can be better than you are already are it will just take commitment . I have told myself many time when I feel like I reached my max potential that I just feel like this , but I could still push myself harder and make it so I am even better than I thought I could be . It changed the way I look at thing and how I act in my life .

 Don ’ t take it personally
 As an aspiring actress , I have learned that rejection is a part of life . I have been rejected from theater so many time that it is hard to count at this point , but I feel a if that ha built me up to the person I am . When I wa younger , I would respond to rejection by going up to my room , locking the door , and just cry for hour straight . I really just wanted to give up . At that age , you truly almost can ’ t control it . Even when I wasn ’ t auditioning , I would still go through these phase when I just felt hopeless …
 For me , trying to look at what I can improve on help , but even so , there are so many factor that go into casting . From not being the right height to not having the right vocal range , so many thing that go into it , and for me , learning to not take it personally is one of the most important thing anyone can learn .

 As a kid who play three sport , I ’ ve been told no and been criticized a lot in my life . When I wa younger I wa always offended by the answer “ no ” and I saw it a a sign of negativity . I did and still do hold very high standard for myself . The only thing that ’ s changed is how I take the criticism , whether or not it ’ s delivered nicely with a warm and cozy feeling .
 When I get the answer “ no ” , get criticized , or get a bad grade , I look back on the test I failed or the moment on the field in which I messed up and I do some self reflection . I try to first identify the problem then decide how I can work on and fix that problem . As a matter of fact , now that I know how to take criticizm and no for an answer , I like to have friend and coach who criticize me more so that I can continue endlessly working and self improving .

 Learn to move on
 This situation may not seem like much , but I recall when I wa about 8 year old , I had a Lego set that I got for Christmas . It wa a star war set that I had to build by following the instruction , and every time that I got to this one step , the whole thing would fall apart . It wa really frustrating going through this process over and over again just to fail repeatedly . Obviously , being only 8 year old , I did not take this well , I would get angry and maybe even throw some of the piece across the room .
 Looking back on it now , I can see that it wa silly to be upset over Legos . But I think I did learn how to control my anger , after all of these failure , I started to ease into getting le and le frustrated …I wa able to understand that if you get too frustrated from failure , you will never succeed . For the next time I face rejection , I would tell my future self to pull it together , not to get upset , and move on from that rejection so it doesn ’ t stick with you and drag you down .

 Part 2 : Internal Divisions President Trump ’ s election made the Murdoch family more powerful than ever . But the bitter struggle between James and Lachlan threatened to tear the company apart .

 This is Part 2 of a three-part story . Go back and read Part 1 .
 In a matter of month , Rupert Murdoch had married a former supermodel , led Britain ’ s historic vote to break with the European Union and played a pivotal role in the American election . He now had a close relationship with the British prime minister , Theresa May , and an even closer one with the incoming American president , Donald J. Trump . But his medium empire wa more vulnerable than ever . Netflix , Amazon , Apple and a host of other new technology company were streaming content directly to consumer and were growing at unabated rate across the globe . It wa an overwhelming existential challenge to legacy medium company like 21st Century Fox . Once viewed a a global colossus , Murdoch ’ s empire wa now in danger of being too small . He desperately needed international scale to compete . The answer seemed obvious : The Murdochs had to take full control of Sky .
 With annual revenue of some $ 16 billion , Sky wa the largest pay-TV provider in Britain and across Europe . The Murdochs currently owned only 39 percent of it , and that share already generated the company three time the revenue of Fox News . What ’ s more , Sky had it own 24-hour news channel in Britain , Sky News , which could be built into a global news network to take on the Murdochs ’ longtime rival , the publicly financed BBC .
 For James , who would be leading the Sky acquisition , the potential deal also represented something more personal : an opportunity for redemption . He tried to buy Sky five year earlier , in part by forging a close alliance with David Cameron , then a Conservative member of Parliament who wa eyeing the prime ministership . What began with Cameron ’ s dropping by a Murdoch family vacation near the Greek isle of Santorini turned into a mutually beneficial friendship between James and the candidate . The aim of both party were clear . Cameron wanted the support of the Murdochs . James wanted Ofcom , the British regulatory agency that would rule on whether the Murdochs were “ fit and proper ” operator of Sky , out of his way . With the 2010 election approaching , Cameron publicly promised that under a Conservative government , “ Ofcom a we know it will cease to exist. ” Not long after , James summoned Cameron to the George , a private club in the Mayfair area of London , to tell him that The Sun would reverse 12 year of support for the Labor Party and endorse him . ( James and Cameron have each denied that there wa any quid pro quo for the endorsement . ) But just a James wa getting all of the piece in place , the phone-hacking scandal broke . He and his father were hauled in front of Parliament , and James wa forced to withdraw their $ 12 billion bid for Sky . Ofcom survived .
 [ Read 6 takeaway from this story . ]
 Lachlan and others inside 21st Century Fox were concerned about James ’ s leading this second Sky bid , given how closely associated he had been with the hacking scandal and with the family ’ s first failed attempt to gain full control of the satellite company . But James , who knew the company best , wa adamant , and in December 2016 , he struck a new deal with the owner of Sky . The lawyer for 21st Century Fox , Allen & Overy , sent a lengthy memo to Karen Bradley , Britain ’ s secretary of state for culture , medium and sport , detailing why this bid wa different from the earlier one . Not only had the Murdochs shut down The News of the World , the newspaper that had been found guilty of widespread hacking ; they had also divided the empire into two different entity : News Corp and 21st Century Fox . The company that would be purchasing Sky , 21st Century Fox , had thus been separated from the family ’ s newspaper . Further , the lawyer wrote that the company ’ s culture had changed substantially since the hacking scandal : It “ ha adopted strong governance measure and control to ensure it meet the highest standard of corporate conduct. ” James expressed similar confidence on a conference call with Wall Street analyst : “ We do think that this pass regulatory muster , ” he said .
 One other factor made the proposed deal especially attractive . Thanks to Brexit , the Murdochs would be getting full ownership of Sky at the steeply discounted price of $ 14.8 billion if the deal went through . The British government wa paralyzed , unable to reach an agreement to implement the break with the European bloc . Foreign company were pulling out of Britain , destabilizing the country ’ s job market and the economy and , in turn , significantly depressing the value of the English pound — and with it , the price of Sky ’ s share .
 All that needed to happen wa for the government to approve the deal . With the Sky bid once again pending before Ofcom , James embarked on a campaign of contrition and humility designed to convince the British establishment that he and his family business could be trusted to own Sky .
 Even a James wa pursuing his bid to take full control of Sky in Britain , the company ’ s Australian division — Lachlan ’ s domain — wa closing a much smaller but still significant deal for the family to take full control of a different Sky subsidiary : Sky News Australia , which it jointly owned with two Australian medium company . It wa the country ’ s only 24-hour cable news channel and an unexploited opportunity for influence on another continent .
 The Murdochs ’ newspaper holding accounted for some 60 percent of the Australian print market , and included the country ’ s sole national general-interest paper , The Australian . As the face of this continental newspaper empire , Lachlan wielded an enormous amount of political power in the country . Over the previous decade , Murdoch paper helped push out two different prime minister , Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard . When Gillard ’ s treasurer , Wayne Swan , wa worried that the Murdoch attack were hurting the national economy , he sought out Lachlan to make an appeal , Swan told u . Lachlan built alliance , too , drawing close to Tony Abbott , a member of Parliament whose right-wing politics and confrontational style had earned him frequent comparison to Newt Gingrich . When Abbott served a prime minister , from 2013 to 2015 , he would discus legislation with the Murdochs ’ editor — and occasionally the Murdochs themselves — before introducing it , the former editor of The Australian , Chris Mitchell , wrote in his memoir .
 Now Murdoch ’ s Australian empire wa expanding into cable news . The country ’ s dominant broadcaster wa the Australian Broadcast Corporation , a publicly financed institution modeled after the BBC . Its reporting wa similarly straight and sober . Sky News Australia — which also air in New Zealand — wa , notionally , a competitor , but it audience wa small , even by Australian standard . Still , the network offered Lachlan his own opportunity for redemption : After his split with his father , he presided over the implosion of the Australian TV network Ten . His failed effort to save it included giving a reality-TV dance show to his wife and signing off on a weekly show for a controversial right-wing firebrand , Andrew Bolt . A columnist at the Murdoch-owned Herald Sun , Bolt had impressed Lachlan year earlier at a company retreat in Pebble Beach , Calif. , when he aggressively questioned Al Gore after Gore presented his slide show on climate change . When Bolt wa awarded his show on Ten , he wa facing charge for violating the country ’ s Racial Discrimination Act by writing that light-skinned Aborigines were claiming indigenous status for personal gain . ( Bolt wa found guilty , and the publisher wa forced to print a lengthy statement acknowledging the offense . )


 With the acquisition of Sky News Australia , Lachlan would have a second chance . The Murdochs won full control of the network in December 2016 , while James ’ s Sky deal in Britain wa still pending . Sky News Australia ’ s programming had historically been politically balanced . But a the Murdochs ’ takeover approached , the network began increasing the amount of right-wing commentary it broadcast during prime time .
 Not long before the deal closed , Lachlan ’ s old Ten host Andrew Bolt wa brought in to do a nightly political program . Immediately after the purchase , Sky signed up a a host and commentator Caroline Marcus , a columnist for The Daily Telegraph of Sydney who had supported a ban on burkinis in France and lamented what she described a reverse discrimination against white in cultural debate . Ross Cameron — a former member of the Australian Parliament prone to anti-gay slur who later spoke at an event hosted by a far-right organization that describes itself a Australia ’ s leading anti-Islamic group — co-hosted a program called “ The Outsiders. ” He and his fellow host described themselves a “ Trump ’ s Aussie mate ” and half-joked that their show would provide “ absolutely no balance whatsoever. ” After one host , Mark Latham , wa fired for making a series of offensive comment , including a homophobic remark about a high school student who participated in a video for International Women ’ s Day , he ran successfully for state office a a member of One Nation , the country ’ s far-right anti-immigrant party . Soon after Lachlan took over , an old political ally , Tony Abbott ’ s former chief of staff , Peta Credlin , became a prime-time host on Sky . Still closely allied with Abbott , she used her platform to argue that Australia should slow down it effort to combat climate change , take a stricter line on immigration and resist the liberal drift of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull , a bitter Abbott rival .
 Known a Sky After Dark , the opinion-heavy , almost-uniformly right-wing lineup wa an entirely new phenomenon in Australian TV . Its nighttime rating spiked a the network quickly became required viewing for the country ’ s political class .
 By the early month of 2017 , Murdoch ’ s interim leadership of Fox News , which started with Ailes ’ s ouster before the election , wa now beginning to look permanent . He installed beneath him two of Ailes ’ s loyal deputy : Jack Abernethy , who wa in charge of operation , and Bill Shine , a close friend of Hannity ’ s who had been overseeing the opinion lineup but would now also run the entire news operation . Neither wa known for his independent thinking . A rival executive called Shine “ the butler ” because of his uncanny tendency to appear at Ailes ’ s side to address his need . Even a Murdoch wa elevating Shine , numerous accusation — some of them in lawsuit against Ailes — were surfacing that Shine had protected and even enabled Ailes during his year of allegedly sexually harassing woman at the network . ( Shine ha denied any wrongdoing . )
 After the election , Murdoch moved even more forcefully to support Trump . When Greta Van Susteren , a former CNN host and a somewhat ideologically unpredictable presence in the Fox lineup , left the network , Murdoch enthusiastically endorsed the idea of replacing her at 7 p.m. with Tucker Carlson — a conservative writer and a founder of the Daily Caller website who wa earning praise from white nationalist heading into Trump ’ s election . Murdoch marked the occasion by taking Carlson out to brunch with Jerry Hall in New York . When Megyn Kelly , who sealed her fame by clashing with Trump , left Fox in early 2017 , Murdoch opted not to replace her with another Trump antagonist .
 Murdoch also kept in close touch with the White House . He and Kushner had always spoken frequently , but now he wa in regular contact with Trump too . Trump enjoyed getting his call . As someone who prized wealth and power , Trump had long admired Murdoch ; for decade , it had invariably been Trump who called Murdoch , asking for help . Now it wa Murdoch reaching out to Trump on a regular basis . “ Rupert , Rupert ! ” Trump would say , talking on the phone with Murdoch in the Oval Office , according to a former White House official who overheard the conversation . “ You love the action , don ’ t you ? You can ’ t get enough of this shit . ”
 Trump wa also spending a lot of time on the phone with Hannity , who regularly called the president after his show . Trump had often found him to be too much of a supplicant for his purpose : He preferred his more combative interview with Bill O ’ Reilly , which he felt better showcased his pugnaciousness , according to a former White House official . But Trump appreciated Hannity ’ s loyalty . The Fox host had effectively been a member of his campaign team , for instance pressing Trump ’ s personal lawyer , Michael Cohen , to be on the lookout for former girlfriend and employee who might make trouble for the candidate ahead of the election , two people familiar with the interaction told u . ( Hannity , through a Fox representative , denies having done so . ) His show became a nightly hourlong campaign infomercial . Hannity ’ s audience wa Trump ’ s most devoted base . In an interview with The New York Times , Ailes once described Hannity a presiding over a “ segmented ” show whose appeal wa limited to hard-core conservative . Now he wa the network ’ s biggest star . He set the tone for the rest of Fox ’ s opinion lineup , which quickly became a nightly counterpoint to the mainstream medium ’ s coverage of Trump .
 As a former medium adviser , Ailes recognized that the Fox News brand depended on the perception that it wa a credible alternative to the liberal medium . He would even sometimes rein in his opinion host when their rhetoric threatened to undermine that perception . Ailes also thought that presenting a monolithic view night after night wa bad television . He wa careful to make sure that the network always had some host who challenged Republican orthodoxy at least occasionally .
 These were matter that did not appear to concern Murdoch . Some of the network ’ s news anchor could deliver at time stark counterprogramming to opinion host like Hannity . Shepard Smith became increasingly pointed in his critical coverage of Trump , expressing disbelief at the “ lie after lie after lie ” coming from the administration ; the Fox anchor Chris Wallace emerged a one of the toughest interrogator of Trump surrogate and official on television ; and Bret Baier ’ s straight coverage regularly infuriated Trump . But the network ’ s prime-time lineup is it biggest draw , and by the fall of 2017 , that lineup wa notably more pro-Trump than it wa under Ailes , with Carlson at 8 , Hannity at 9 and the right-wing radio star Laura Ingraham at 10 . They were joined , of course , by the morning host on “ Fox & Friends , ” the show with which Trump always started his day .
 Years earlier , when James wa fighting in Britain for the first failed Sky deal , he expressed contempt for government meddling in the medium ’ s affair and impugned the nationally esteemed BBC a a “ chilling ” medium monolith . “ The only reliable , durable and perpetual guarantor of independence , ” he said in a lecture at the annual Edinburgh International Television Festival , “ is profit. ” In the spring of 2017 , a James made the round with civic and business leader in London , he took a far more conciliatory tack . He praised the BBC and assured former critic that he respected Britain ’ s strict regulation designed to ensure impartiality in England ’ s news coverage . At an annual conference held by the influential medium analyst Claire Enders , a leading critic of his first Sky bid , James professed an “ aspiration for u to be better ” and promised to “ behave in the way that we imagined we would want to and be expected to in the future . ”
 Even a James wa in the midst of this campaign , the company ’ s behavior wa once again threatening to jeopardize the Sky deal . In April 2017 , The New York Times reported that the Fox News host Bill O ’ Reilly and the network had doled out some $ 13 million to address multiple complaint from woman about O ’ Reilly ’ s lewd comment and unwanted advance and that Fox had nevertheless renewed his contract for $ 25 million . Ofcom wa soon receiving submission from O ’ Reilly ’ s victim . Lisa Bloom , a lawyer representing one of his accuser , drew a direct link between Fox ’ s sexual-harassment scandal and the phone hacking : Both , she wrote , revealed “ a lack of oversight , intervention and decency . ”
 After James and several other senior executive from 21st Century Fox were grilled about the company ’ s culture by Ofcom regulator in the agency ’ s headquarters overlooking the Thames , the Murdochs scrambled to protect their Sky bid . They quickly fired O ’ Reilly , giving him a $ 25 million exit package . When rumor started circulating that Ailes ’ s once-loyal lieutenant , Shine , might be next , Hannity tried to protect him , sensing that his old friend and ally wa about to become a victim of the Murdochs ’ broader global agenda : “ Somebody HIGH UP AND INSIDE FNC is trying to get an innocent person fired , ” he tweeted , presumably referring to James . Shine wa pushed out , too .
 In June 2017 , Ofcom finally issued it report on the acquisition : It recommended that the deal be reviewed by yet another regulatory body . The Competition and Markets Authority would investigate whether Sky would give the Murdochs too much influence over the British medium .
 The decision set off still more scrambling . To prevent any potential problem with the British regulator , Fox executive directed a furious Hannity to dial down his coverage of the death of a Democratic National Committee staff member named Seth Rich , which had spurred wild conspiracy theory and wide public criticism , a well a an advertiser boycott . The Murdochs also pulled Fox News off the air in Britain , where it had been the subject of several formal complaint of “ unfair and inaccurate content. ” ( A separate investigation by British regulator found that Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson had violated British impartiality standard : Hannity for ridiculing critic of Trump ’ s proposed travel ban without presenting a full version of their view or giving them an opportunity to respond , and Carlson for allowing Nigel Farage to make baseless claim that British official had failed to protect “ thousand of underage girl ” from rape and abuse by Muslims . )


 In September 2017 , James delivered the keynote address at the Royal Television Society ’ s annual convention in Cambridge , using the occasion to make the case for the Sky deal and to sketch out his vision for the future of the global medium company that he still hoped to run . He ticked off some of 21st Century Fox ’ s better-known brand — National Geographic , FX , Fox Sports , Sky Atlantic — and described how these and other outlet had “ explored the opioid epidemic , gender identity and race relation ” and “ told powerful story of slavery in America , the right of woman in Pakistan and the coming and inevitable exploration of Mars. ” Absent from his list , and from his entire address , wa one of 21st Century Fox ’ s best-known brand , Fox News . In the question-and-answer session that followed , an interviewer speculated about why the deal wa taking so long . “ I wonder if the message that come through , ” she said , “ is that you presided over this rotten culture at News International and , again , at Fox News , and that people just don ’ t trust you . Is that what you think the message is ? ”
 That November , a bipartisan coalition of British member of Parliament took their concern about the deal to a hearing in Victoria House on Southampton Row , the headquarters of the Competition and Markets Authority . They were led by Ed Miliband , a former leader of the Labor Party and a supporter of antimonopoly medium legislation who had tangled with the Murdochs a couple of year earlier , when The Sun fulminated against his candidacy for prime minister , dubbing him Red Ed and Shameful Mili . They highlighted Fox ’ s promotion of the Seth Rich conspiracy and it airing of false claim that there were zone in London controlled by Shariah law . If the Murdochs gained full control of the satellite broadcast company , the M.P.s warned , they could transform it 24-hour news channel , Sky News , into a British version of Fox News . The question of the Murdochs ’ influence over the medium led , inevitably , to the question of the Murdochs ’ influence over the country ’ s politics . “ I know Rupert , ” Ken Clarke , a member of Parliament , said . “ The idea that Rupert is interested in a detached influence in the politics of the country where he owns his medium — anybody who knew him , you could not put that proposition to them without them breaking into a very broad smile . ”
 In January 2018 , the Competition and Markets Authority issued it ruling on 21st Century Fox ’ s acquisition of Sky : Full ownership of the company would give the Murdochs “ too much control over news provider in the U.K. across all medium platform ( TV , radio , online and newspaper ) and therefore too much influence over public opinion and the political agenda. ” It wa a full-blown repudiation , setting up a final ruling that no member of the Murdoch family should ever be allowed to serve in any capacity at Sky — not even on the company ’ s board . It would be an especially harsh blow to James , who wa serving a Sky ’ s chairman at the time .
 For Lachlan , it wa a validation of his view that James wa the wrong public face of the campaign for Sky , reminding the public of the hacking scandal and all the hostility toward the Murdochs it had stirred up . For James , the failure of the deal wa a bitter vindication of his view that his family ’ s empire could not survive it own politics and culture .
 In early August 2017 , Rupert Murdoch invited Robert A. Iger , the chief executive of Disney , to Moraga , his $ 28.8 million Tuscan-style vineyard estate in the hill of Bel Air , and offered him a glass of wine . The two mogul commiserated about the threat they both faced from the new breed of tech giant and what they could do to confront it . Disney also wanted to get bigger . Talk about combining some of their asset soon evolved into something much more significant : a conversation about Iger ’ s buying 21st Century Fox , the Hollywood studio that Murdoch wrested away from the Colorado oilman Marvin Davis in 1985 . For 65 year , Murdoch had been ruthlessly expanding his empire . He wa now thinking about doing the most un-Murdochian thing imaginable : He wa going to shrink it .
 It wa , in a sense , an admission of defeat . Murdoch ’ s ambition had been subverted , finally and definitively , by his own failing — the family squabble , the reactionary drift of Fox News , the Sky News debacle . But he had a new plan . He would cleave off the Hollywood studio that wa responsible for about two-thirds of the company ’ s revenue and keep his main tool of influence , his newspaper and Fox News . James would move on , perhaps following 21st Century Fox to Disney , and he and Lachlan would run the remaining leaner , scrappier company together like a pirate ship .
 The decision wa driven not only by the imperative of the business but also by those of the Murdoch family . Joint custody of the empire wasn ’ t working . It wa easy for the company ’ s senior executive to see which one Murdoch preferred — Murdoch ’ s face would light up when Lachlan would roll his chair nearer to him at meeting — and they quickly learned which son to go to with question and request . ( “ And Lachlan ? ” Murdoch would ask , whenever executive told him that they had spoken to James about something . ) As James saw it , his brother wa mainly interested in the unique fringe benefit and trapping of power that came with the job . He bristled when Lachlan built a rock-climbing wall on an old soundstage on the studio lot and hired a private security guard to accompany him everywhere . Lachlan , meanwhile , chafed at James ’ s fixation on corporate governance , which he felt wa inconsistent with the company ’ s swashbuckling spirit .
 The Trump presidency wa also exposing a deeper divide between the brother . James wa becoming increasingly troubled by Fox News . He didn ’ t object to the idea of a conservative news network , but he did object to what he felt it had evolved into at certain hour : a political weapon with no editorial standard or concern for the value of truth and a knee-jerk defender of the president ’ s rhetoric and policy . After Trump issued his executive order banning immigration from some Muslim-majority country in early 2017 , James pushed his father and Lachlan to agree to write a companywide memo reassuring it Muslim employee in the United States and abroad . James wanted the note to forcefully and unequivocally establish their opposition to the policy and to tell employee who felt threatened by it that the company would do everything in it power to protect them . Lachlan wanted it to be le confrontational and to not specifically mention Trump or the Muslim ban , which Fox News ’ s opinion host were defending night after night . Even getting Lachlan ’ s approval for the watered-down version that ultimately went out wa “ like pulling teeth , ” James would later say privately , according to people close to him .
 Months later , when Trump blamed “ both side ” for the violence at a white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville , Va. , saying that there were some “ very fine people ” among the white supremacist , Kathryn insisted that they write their own open letter of opposition , without consulting with his brother or father first . “ If we ’ re not going to say something about [ expletive ] Nazis marching in Virginia , when are we going to say something ? ” she told James , according to a person familiar with the conversation .
 Kathryn had historically kept her complaint about the network and the business inside the family , in accordance with the unofficial Murdoch code of conduct . But Fox opinion host ’ embrace of nativism and white nationalism during Trump ’ s rise had eroded her restraint . Her frustration with the family business occasionally broke through on her Twitter account . She wrote supportive reply to post from the Parkland shooting survivor and gun-control activist David Hogg — who had been taunted by Laura Ingraham over his college rejection and wa leading an advertising boycott against her show — a well a from Never Trump Republicans like Bill Kristol who had left the network . And she complimented a Washington Post opinion article that noted that the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer had praised Carlson for “ covering all our talking point . ”
 The resentment that had been steadily building between James and Lachlan over the past two and a half year exploded in the fall of 2018 , a the Disney deal became a possibility , then a probability and then a reality .
 James instantly seized on the idea , seeing it both a a way out of the family business and a a possible route to the biggest job in the medium . He started speaking with Iger separately over lunch and meeting , discussing among other thing what role he might play at Disney . Iger wa in his late 60 ; his contract wa set to expire in the summer of 2019 , and the company had not yet named a successor . A top job in Disney ’ s corporate hierarchy could put James in the running to take over . It had long been his dream to run his family ’ s empire , but Disney , when combined with 21st Century Fox , would be more than three time it size — the largest medium conglomerate in the world , one with no ideological baggage to prevent it from growing and evolving further . James immediately championed the deal during his conversation with fellow 21st Century Fox board member .
 Lachlan wa furious . His father wa talking about dismantling the empire not even three year after coaxing him back from Australia to run it , an empire that had taken a lifetime to build . He argued that 21st Century Fox wa big enough to compete a it wa . The smaller piece of the empire that he would be left with — a network with an aging audience in the increasingly anachronistic business of cable television — wa hardly a growth business . As the talk with Iger progressed , Lachlan ’ s opposition hardened . “ Why the [ expletive ] would I want to run this company ? ” he told people close to him . Lachlan ’ s anger at his father boiled over during a dinner in Manhattan in the fall of 2017 , three people who were familiar with the incident told u . “ If you take one more call on this deal , you will not have a son ! ” he threatened . “ I will never talk to you again. ” ( Representatives for Murdoch and Lachlan denied that he made these threat . )
 Over the course of our reporting , we spoke to a dozen people with direct knowledge of the Disney negotiation . What emerged were two diametrically different narrative of how the next act in the history of the Murdoch dynasty unfolded . Those closer to James say that Lachlan saw his birthright slipping away and tried to undermine the deal , even encouraging a rival bid from a different company that wouldn ’ t buy a many of 21st Century Fox ’ s asset . Those closer to Lachlan say that James wa pushing the deal forward to advance his own career ambition and wa ready to settle for le than they could get for their father ’ s life ’ s work . Lachlan ’ s perception wa affirmed , they said , when his father told him that he had received a call from a banker on the deal , reporting that James wa trying to make his future at Disney part of the negotiation . Murdoch personally assured Iger that it wasn ’ t . ( People closer to James say that there wa no attempt to make the deal contingent on his role at Disney and that his primary concern wa reaching the best agreement for the family and the shareholder . )
 The family ’ s dysfunctional dynamic were readily apparent to Iger . Seeing James a a strong champion of the deal , he kept him close during the negotiation but never committed to offering him a specific , high-level position ; publicly , he said only that he wa considering the issue .
 Negotiations nearly fell apart in October , according to Securities and Exchange Commission filing , when Murdoch called Iger to say that Disney ’ s valuation of the company wa “ inadequate ” and that talk should “ cease. ” But they kept talking , meeting in London — Iger had come for the premiere of Disney ’ s “ Star Wars : The Last Jedi ” — to iron out more detail . On Dec. 13 , 2017 , they announced an initial deal valued at $ 52.4 billion .
 Accompanying the announcement wa a photograph of Iger and Murdoch , their arm placed awkwardly on each other ’ s shoulder , standing on the rooftop of a London building , St. Paul ’ s Cathedral looming in the background . It wa a peculiar image : the mogul who built the country ’ s most polarizing , rage-stoking political brand beside the one who presided over a medium conglomerate whose very name wa synonymous with equanimity and uplift . Inside the Murdoch empire , the incompatibility of Fox News and 21st Century Fox had long been a source of private complaint and ironic humor : “ The Simpsons , ” a Fox show , once parodied Fox News with a rolling news ticker featuring headline like “ Do Democrats Cause Cancer ? ” and “ Study : 92 Percent of Democrats Are Gay. ” Showrunners on the West Coast would press the Murdochs to get the network under control when a Fox News host would say something they considered offensive , for instance during the network ’ s coverage of the Charlottesville rally . But for many 21st Century Fox executive , the offense had become a nightly occurrence during the Trump era , a the network ’ s opinion host fueled white resentment and anti-immigrant furor . Now , 21st Century Fox would be merged into a company that famously and assiduously avoided politics .
 As for Fox News , the network would have one fewer corporate impediment preventing it from giving it viewer what they wanted .

 It usually take a while — a decade or two — before we can look back at a particular era of American life and see it a something coherent , something whose every aspect is marked by one overarching mood . It take a certain amount of hindsight to notice how all the wildly different reaction people had to the moment were still , in the end , reaction to the same thing ; all the different pose they adopted were still being struck against the same backdrop .
 But this era — this year , and the last one , and one or two before that — might be an exception . There ’ s an oddly strong in-the-moment consensus on how everyone is feeling these day , and it is not good . At some point it became a routine conversational tic for all sort of people , of all sort of persuasion , to express , with an incredulous gesture , that thing feel a bit grueling and frantic lately , don ’ t they ? Musicians are no exception . “ Life is pretty tumultuous right now for all of u , ” said the crossover country star Kacey Musgraves , while accepting a Grammy for the Album of the Year . The Swedish singer Robyn acknowledges that “ pop at the moment is depressing ” in an interview midway through this issue . “ The music kid are listening to is heavy ! Maybe it ’ s hard to be positive and optimistic at the moment . ”
 What ’ s amazing is that the musical expression of all this isn ’ t always some big swing toward darkness , or anger , or anxiety . ( Though there is , in certain genre , plenty of all that a well . ) Read through this list , and what you ’ ll often see instead is a very earnest , very serious desire to find the right reaction to a world that feel tense and high-stakes — an ambient conviction that music should be looking for way to cope , way to protect ourselves , moment of escape , hard reckoning with our collective responsibility , idea for how to make the world feel le brutal . The 25 song and artist below include blockbuster hit , critical darling and inescapable conversation piece , but few of them take a direct route to the usual joy of pop — the song about dancing and boasting and sex and love , the one about what a fantastic night everyone ’ s about to have or what ecstasy they intend to find by the end of it . No , a lot of these song seem focused on deeper challenge : How do we get to those joy in the first place ? Who get to have them , and who deserves them ? And in one case : Which of them are worth the corresponding rise in sea level ?
 The artist do not always sound thrilled about the circumstance . ( “ The society we live in at the moment , ” Robyn say — “ we didn ’ t really make it very good , you know ? ” ) But they ’ re a lot more motivated — whether it ’ s to articulate something bleak or find their way toward something better — than you might expect .

 How aging — and the age — can change a song ’ s meaning .
 By HANIF ABDURRAQIB
 I don ’ t know if Bruce Springsteen think about death a much a I think about the inevitability of his dying . I ’ ve lived an entire life a a fan of Bruce Springsteen , which mean I have already imagined the world without him in it , and I have mourned that world . If you ’ re lucky enough to age gracefully beyond a certain point , with that aging will come an acceptance of finality or of the idea that there is going to be a darkness from which you can ’ t return . If you ’ re lucky enough to have made a life writing song or story or something at the intersection of song and story , this could mean that there come a point where you make sure people hear you clearly , one last time , before you go .
 I don ’ t know if Springsteen himself think about his life and death in this way , but the silence in “ Springsteen on Broadway ” — which ran on Broadway from Oct. 3 , 2017 , to Dec. 15 , 2018 , culminating in a soundtrack and a Netflix special — suggest he might . The space he built in between the song allow the artist to explain and give context not to just the music but also to the life built around the music . If the project of Springsteen ’ s Broadway show wa to attach history and legacy to the individual song long adored by the public , there is also something to be said about what time doe to natural storyteller . They can become more tactile with age , drawing out story that have been told several time before the most current retelling — leaving a listener with even more touchable moment than otherwise might have been asked for or sought , so that when the storyteller is long gone , there might still be fragment of his or her story that span generation .
 Of the many gripping example of this in “ Springsteen on Broadway , ” the one that stand out most memorably is the sprawling story he tell before playing his iconic ( and often misconstrued song ) “ Born in the U.S.A. ” The story center on Walter Cichon , who wa the frontman for the Motifs , a band Springsteen still considers one of the best rock ’ n ’ roll band from the Jersey Shore . In the ’ 60 , the Motifs played weekend show to room packed with teenage admirer . Cichon wore his hair long and sported pointy black boot . When he performed , he would shake out his hair and send bead of sweat flying past the stage light . For anyone who ha ever lived in any town where a band wa on the verge of “ making it , ” you know the epiphany : This band is too good to be here , in this place , in this moment . That wa the Motifs , with their frantic and warbly guitar laid below Cichon ’ s howling vocal .
 Walter Cichon wa drafted when he wa 21 and didn ’ t come back from Vietnam . He went missing in action in 1968 .
 On Broadway , Bruce Springsteen performs “ Born in the U.S.A. ” largely in silence . The song is half-spoken , half-sung , Springsteen ’ s voice rough and breaking beneath the decade of labor it ha done — labor rendered romantic through writing and performance . What ha always been true about the career of Bruce Springsteen is that he ’ s most entertaining when backed by his pal , but he ’ s most earnest when he ’ s alone . To hear “ Born in the U.S.A. ” presented without an instrument is to hear the strain that push toward the edge of anger , that hovering sentiment that wa lost in the original ’ s bombastic wall of sound and perhaps camouflaged by it imagery . At the time of the song ’ s release , Springsteen wa a young , attractive , muscular man who appeared midjump in front of an American flag on the single ’ s cover . From a zoomed-out perspective — a white musician writing about the intricacy of labor — it could seem a if he represented everything that a particular America would be proud of . The misreading of the original song wa not purely accidental : Its volume and fanfare meant that it sounded ( and still sound ) good bursting out of speaker while firework explode in the sky , and it loudest word in the chorus are about land and birthright . But with the drum and burst of keyboard gone , the relentlessly hollow hope of the song is gone , too . On the isolated stage of a theater , all that ’ s left is knowing that the singer ha loved and dreamed and lost in a country sometimes not worth loving and dreaming and losing in .
 In his long monologue introducing “ Born in the U.S.A. ” on Broadway , Springsteen talk about “ the blood and the confusion and the pride and the shame and the grace that come with birthplace , ” and I get it . There are some of u who didn ’ t ask to be born in our particular here , and there are some of u who didn ’ t ask to come to this particular here , but to be in wherever your here is mean that you might be compelled to both fight for it and forgive it . On Broadway , Springsteen mention something else : He tell the story of him and two of his friend being summoned to the selective-service office , a a prelude to being sent to Vietnam — for what , he say , “ we were sure wa going to be our funeral. ” They did everything they could to get out of being drafted , and succeeded . He end the story by exhaling softly and pausing before telling the audience : “ I do sometimes wonder who went in my place . Because somebody did . ”
 I imagine that ’ s it . To live a long enough life in a place founded , in part , on violence and volatility is to know that long life may depend on someone else walking through a door you wanted no part of . Or to know that the hero from your hometown never made it out because war got to them first . Stripped to it barest bone , “ Born in the U.S.A. ” asks a listener to recognize that human survival is not something we can count on . The song matter now in a different way than it did in 1984 , largely because of the artist behind it : Springsteen , trying to wrestle not only with the song ’ s current legacy but also with how it might be co-opted decade from now , when he won ’ t be around to make sure people understand the ache behind the song ’ s fury .

 The Ambiguous kiss-off .
 By AMANDA HESS
 ‘ Thank u , next ” is styled like a tweet , which is how the phrase first appeared — a a cryptic rebuke that Ariana Grande thumbed off in the comedian Pete Davidson ’ s general direction a few day after their breakup . Since then , the phrase ha pulsed through the culture , undulating between naughty and nice . When the song debuted , it wa revealed to be not a takedown but instead a sincere tribute to relationship past , lifting Davidson ( “ for Pete , I ’ m so thankful ” ) to the same plane a her ex Mac Miller , the rapper who died of a drug overdose last year ( “ he wa an angel ” ) . But then the video hit , and in it , Grande cosplayed a Regina George , the demon Barbie of “ Mean Girls , ” scrawling note about her ex in a burn book . But then all the thing she wrote about them were really nice ! A quick shot in the video show the apology she scrawled on Davidson ’ s page — “ sry i dipped ” — which wa secretly the most savage note of all : For the record , she dumped him .
 Online , the phrase ha bloomed into a deliciously ambiguous kiss-off , a usage modeled by Grande herself , directed toward anyone from a no-name rapper who covered the song to Piers Morgan , who criticized pop star for appearing in revealing photo shoot . Like the Southern “ bless your heart , ” the passive-aggressive nicety that sustain the entire Midwest or the chill of the British stiff upper lip , the internet ha found a discreet slight of it own in “ thank u , next . ”
 The phrase is breezily transactional . It render news anchor and ex-boyfriend into stranger , reducing them to the base level of politeness required by the social contract . It sharpens respect into a shiv . And yet it is vexing in it restraint , pre-emptively silencing any retaliatory effort .
 We are living in a time of great pettiness . A big star can grow two size by doing something very small . Bhad Bhabie chucked a drink at Iggy Azalea and cemented her status a a memetic folk hero . Pusha T lobbed a literal baby into the middle of his rap war with Drake . Grande ’ s grace could , in one reading , signal a rejection of all of this calculated cruelty , a classy subversion of the fan-and-industry expectation that a celebrity may only rise by tearing another down .
 But it ’ s also a savvy strategy for advancing the game . The next level of beef is always the high road — ascending to that rarefied realm of conflict where put-down are joined seamlessly with self-respect . In “ thank u , next , ” Grande cast her ex a steppingstones on her path to greatness , men who taught her “ patience , ” “ pain ” and , ultimately , how little she needed them . There ’ s nothing harsher than having your relationship converted into a learning experience . And the worst part is , you know she ’ s right . The secret message of “ thank u , next ” is that woman can dismiss men who sap their energy and undermine their success , and this is not an act of cruelty or a symptom of bitchiness . It ’ s a simple social nicety .

 The new R. & B . litmus test requires artist to be accessible , enigmatic and maybe a little bit flawed . Sanging is optional .
 By ANGELA FLOURNOY
 From the vocal singularity embodied in Aretha Franklin to the otherworldly dance move of Michael Jackson , black folk have long expected rigor from our R. & B . entertainer . ( We institutionalized this expectation at the Apollo Theater , where , on Amateur Night , an “ executioner ” used to chase away mediocre performer midact with a broom or a pitchfork ; now he just dance them off the stage . ) Being the best in R. & B . meant that you had a honed , real-deal ability to entertain , that you could stand on a stage and perform a remarkable act that separated you from the rest of u .
 I grew up hearing debate about the worthiness of this or that singer devolve into shouting match , the assertion that a favored artist could sing but not really sang being an affront to your system of taste and judgment . Mariah Carey wa always an easy win . In a single verse , her melismatic contralto might argue with her teasing falsetto , alternating between lower and higher note until she sounded more bird than human . In the ’ 90 , girl-next-door Mariah belted out uptempo love song on one station ; a few turn of the dial over , she sang the same record with the addition of a hip-hop verse , thereby sliding from mainstream to “ urban , ” which is to say from white to black . She straddled two coded world a a biracial person , a sometimes-fraught experience that she addressed on her 1997 song “ Outside . ”
 Her desire for cross-genre acceptance is part of what pushed her to write and arrange song for herself that few other human being could cover . Through the mid-2000s , to listen to a Mariah album , from lead single to deep cut , wa to marvel at a maximalist pulling off her excess , every run more dazzling than the last . And yet by the end of the aught , she had begun receding behind her production , talk-singing and whispering where she used to overaccentuate each phrase . The rumored loss of her voice seemed to mark the end of an era altogether .
 Few people argue over the voice of a singer the way they used to , but R. & B . is back in vogue after having spent several year in the background a E.D.M . dictated pop ’ s music imperative . Younger artist are pushing the genre forward in many respect : intriguing , pared-down personal style ( SZA ) ; forceful , nuanced messaging ( Solange ) ; swaggering vocal that don ’ t feel yoked to the rap feature ( H.E.R . ) ; and a much-needed expansion of whom a woman might be singing love song to in the first place ( Syd ) . But the term by which we expect rigor from these artist have changed , too . A voice that sound a though it were gifted from the heaven is no longer a likely predictor of critical success , though it may garner you a stint on “ The Voice. ” More important is appearing unvarnished , or idiosyncratic . Contemporary R. & B . seems to prefer the D.I.Y . ethos of indie rock or riffing on the earthy , unadorned feel of neo-soul . The preferred feel is that of a raw outpouring of emotion alone in a bedroom with a laptop . To see R. & B. ’ s newest name perform at event like the Grammys is a bit like seeing your high school gym teacher on a date — who even knew they owned fancy clothes ?
 Mariah Carey doesn ’ t seem built for this new R. & B . moment , but “ A No No , ” from her 2018 album “ Caution , ” work for all the reason we would once expect it not to . It ’ s a straightforward sample of an extremely familiar song ( a remix of Lil ’ Kim ’ s 1997 “ Crush on You ” ) . Vocally , it ’ s uncomplicated . The track ha a few elastic moment at the top of verse , but for the most part , Carey maintains a syncopated , crooning sing-speak . She come down from the vocal stratosphere to some place closer to the younger R. & B . chanteuses , but it never feel like a cop-out . “ Caution ” a a whole forgoes Carey ’ s hallmark vocal pyrotechnic , save for a few whistle tone that creep into the final note of several track . What make it different from her previous attempt at le ornate vocal arrangement is the confidence Carey exudes . She isn ’ t hiding ; she ’ s recalibrating .
 This new phase of R. & B . is one for which Mariah the songwriter is well suited . She ha always been a quick study of current trend , and a a writer on 17 of her 18 No.1 single , she proved that she knew how to make her voice fit within them . Carey posse a mischievous sense of humor ( best employed on Eminem dis track ) that is fit for our current age of trolling and lyric made for meme . In “ A No No ” she drawl out the line “ Irregardless of what transpired , ” daring the listener to think too hard about whether she know that she ha deployed a fake word ( of course she doe ) . Over the past three decade , Mariah the vocalist ha been so singular that other Mariahs went overlooked — the canny recognizer of trend , the pop star who pushed her label to make unlikely hip-hop collaboration happen and the songwriter who wa funnier than people understood . Mariah , queen of glitter and lover of glamour , might never pull off a down-to-earth visual aesthetic , but she still posse the tool to make music that embodies that feeling — and she ha had these tool for year .

 He ’ s been rapping about it for year . Now a lot more people are listening .
 Interview by NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES
 Last year , in a span of month , Meek Mill went from solitary confinement in a Pennsylvania prison to releasing an album that debuted at No.1 on the Billboard chart . It ’ s a paradoxical narrative that ha defined the Philadelphia rapper since his teenage year , when he landed both a record deal and criminal conviction on drug and gun charge . Sentenced at 21 to prison and year of probation , the 31-year-old rapper ha spent his entire adult life in and out of court and prison , often for noncriminal violation like not adequately reporting his travel plan .
 But 2018 proved transformative . New scrutiny of the judge overseeing his probation , and of the initial case — he ha always maintained that the police made up charge — roused public support from powerful people , including Jay-Z , Philadelphia ’ s district attorney and the Philadelphia 76ers co-owner Michael Rubin . With tour date for his “ Championships ” album selling out , Mill ha become a leading voice on the failing of the criminal-justice system . Along with writing an op-ed for The New York Times and appearing on national news show , the rapper helped start the Reform Alliance , an organization dedicated to getting one million Americans out of the prison system .
 How long did you work on the album ? Probably eight month . Since I came out .
 I usually take about eight month to produce a piece a well . Then there ’ s panic — you ’ ve gone over it so many time , you can ’ t even tell anymore if it ’ s good or not . I feel the same way . Going through the music so much , not even knowing if it ’ s good anymore — I done heard it at least a thousand time , trying to analyze and look at it so many way .
 At the end of “ Championships , ” you say we had to beat the street , beat racism , beat poverty . So much of what you write is sociological , a study of the neighborhood . Your being from Philadelphia made me think about W.E.B . Du Bois in 1899 — he did a study called “ The Philadelphia Negro. ” Yeah , I read piece of it in prison . One of the older guy probably gave it to me .
 Then you know what I ’ m talking about . This wa known a the first sociological study of black Americans in the country . He wa trying to understand why black folk lived the way they lived . And the social problem he identified — poverty , crime , illiteracy , white discrimination — are the exact same thing you talk about 120 year later . That wa my life coming up , so it wa normal . I always tell people , I ’ ve been living the life I ’ m living now for the last eight year , but I ’ ve been living in the ghetto for 23 . Things we ’ ve been traumatized by our whole life — we have a right to talk about it .
 You refer to school a couple of time on this album — your mom praying you ’ d go to Yale , or going to a school with bullet hole in the locker . You said you were on the honor roll ? I used to be , until , like , third grade . There wa another book I got in prison , about black kid — the fourth grade , thing go wrong and grade start to decline . That wa my life . Mine wa because I moved to a different neighborhood , rougher than the one I came from .
 One of my favorite quote from James Baldwin is “ The kid had been told that they weren ’ t worth [ expletive ] , and everything they saw around them proved it. ” What did your school say about what society thought of you ? We used to have teacher say , “ Oh , you ’ re probably going to be dead or in jail , or you ’ re probably going to be a failure. ” I had some good teacher , too , but it wa rough in our school .
 I feel like that ’ s a message we start telling black boy very early : You ’ re going to be dead or in jail . I know we ’ re trying to warn them , but it also seems a if you ’ re dictating their future . Yeah , but I never believed that . I used to say I wa going to be a normal story of the ghetto . But if you have your mom telling you you ’ re going to be a great person and then your teacher talk to you like that — you wouldn ’ t really want to listen to that person anymore .
 Was school easy for you ? Pretty easy . I didn ’ t have to study to pas my test . Even if I ran the hallway , I would still be fairly good . Later on , when I really stopped trying , I wa put in disciplinary school . It wa like a jail . You get strip-searched before you go in , fingerprinted every day . One day I just climbed over the gate and left .
 It wa a public school organized like a jail ? In other word , it wa early conditioning for what everybody assumed your future wa going to be . When I finally went to jail , I already knew everybody . Everybody I went to school with wa in the jail .
 What were you put in that school for ? Fighting and acting up . I said in one of my rap , I wa acting up in school because I thought it wa cool , but really I wa hurt . Your mom ’ s at work , your dad ’ s in the graveyard , you ’ re not really getting nurtured , and I guess you just resort to acting up .
 You have a song called “ Trauma , ” which talk about that , the PTSD young people in these neighborhood are dealing with . But that ’ s why I love that Baldwin quote — everything about the environment tell these kid they ’ re nothing , right ? But when they react in what ’ s actually a very normal way , we want to break them down . You don ’ t value yourself because you grow up not being valued . What type of motivation do you get if your mom is on drug ? Your self-esteem is automatically just low . Some people have the determination to shoot to the top . But , you know , that ’ s not normal — for just a regular kid to have the determination to do that .
 I always say anger is an easier emotion to deal with than pain . Yeah . That ’ s why I say , you come through neighborhood and you see kid with their face all balled up or looking angry ? They ’ re probably really angry . His mom is probably really on drug , and he probably really don ’ t have food in the house , and his dad is probably really dead . They hurt , they torn , they scarred . It ’ s nothing that word can really fix . “ Why is this kid always angry ? ” Well , he ’ s been through something .
 Who ’ s the first black writer you ever read ? I ’ d never be able to determine who wa black and white when I wa reading back then . I don ’ t know the first . “ The New Jim Crow ” — that ’ s a black writer ?
 Yes . Michelle Alexander . When you were in high school , you weren ’ t exposed to black literature , black writer ? I went to public school . The book were falling apart . They probably still got the same book from when I wa in school . We didn ’ t get no black literature in public school .
 I read a lot a a child , mostly because I wa grounded all the time . Then we had a black-studies course in high school , and I became obsessed with black history because it felt like , for the first time , the world made sense . You would see your community and how people lived , and they would tell you we just did not want better . But I could see how hard people worked , and they still could not get ahead . Studying history calmed me . The most I ever read wa in prison . There ’ s nothing to do , so you turn to book . Reading made me process the system . Sometimes I thought it wa just million of black people , and Spanish — when you come to prison , it ’ s black and Spanish . Looking deeper , and seeing the way some of those thing are broken down in “ The New Jim Crow , ” it made me really wonder . Because I am already a conspiracy theorist .
 I don ’ t understand how you can be black and not be a conspiracy theorist . I wa doing a show on CNN , and a guy wa like , “ Why are you saying the system is similar to slavery ? ” It kind of caught me off guard , and I couldn ’ t really answer . But you ’ ve got people working for eight cent in here . You ’ re feeding people the [ expletive ] you would feed slave . You ’ ve got people cuffed up , shackled from top to bottom . People locked in the basement for 23 hour a day , being beat by the officer . It ’ s basically the same . And one of the amendment say that when you ’ re under custody of the government , you can be treated like a slave .
 Yes , the 13th . So you were first arrested — for the original charge — at 19 ? My first arrest wa actually going to school . In sixth or seventh grade . I wa suspended , and I didn ’ t want to tell my mom , so I tried to hang out in the hallway . I got caught and went to jail for trespassing . My mom had to come get me .
 What ’ s the charge you ’ re still on probation for ? Selling crack . This is to my dad ’ s soul : I wasn ’ t selling crack when they locked me up for it . When I got back , I had to get back in the street and start really selling weed to get me a lawyer , because everyone who had a public defender got crucified . My mug shot ha my face swollen , both side of my face beat up . I wa charged with fracturing the cop ’ s hand . You know how his hand got fractured ?
 Yeah , punching you . Yeah . He charged me for him punching my face . They said I pointed a gun at them . If somebody can sit there and tell you the story of how they didn ’ t point a gun at cop , nine time out of 10 , it ’ s true . It ’ s not too many people who can make it out of pointing a gun at a couple cop .
 I remember one time , this judge said , “ I don ’ t give people three to six month ; I give people three to six year ” — for something like a first-time weed charge . That always stuck with me . That ’ s not O.K . I mean , you can ’ t shoot nobody and expect to be getting chance . But if you were on probation and began smoking weed ? People in the ’ hood are going through real [ expletive ] . I barely sleep from so much trauma . Sometimes you just want to smoke and go to sleep .
 And you ’ ve got to think about it — you ’ ve got 18- , 19-year-old kid , sending them to a whole building full of rapist , killer . They put you in a cell with a 45-year-old man who got a life sentence , who ’ s a killer . This is your dad right here . He ’ s going to raise you . He ’ s going to show you how to clean the toilet , how to carry yourself . They ’ re not thinking about that . They ’ re just giving this guy three year to get taught this mentality .
 My mom wa a probation officer . She would tell me how certain officer would wait outside the person ’ s house , trying to catch them . And it ’ s for noncriminal thing , right ? The average person , I think , belief that people are being violated because they ’ re doing criminal activity . But I ’ ve had family and friend incarcerated , and part of their probation would be that they couldn ’ t drive . In a place with no public transit , they would drive to work and get violated . You can ’ t associate with known felon , but that mean you can ’ t be around your family member or go to the barbershop . You can ’ t associate with felon when you just came from prison , with a thousand felon in your face every day . That make no sense . One time the judge wa like , “ This is lenient , ” and in my head — I couldn ’ t say this — I wa like , Who are you to even say this is lenient ? If you gave me three month , that is not lenient . I ’ m going to lose my job , lose the lease on my house . She made it a condition that I couldn ’ t even rap .
 In prison , you were 23-and-1 , right ? Isolated all but one hour a day ? I can ’ t even imagine what that ’ s like . Nobody can . I wa just talking to 21 Savage in prison , and I wa like , This is the closest you ’ ve ever been to God in a room like this . The last time I wa on 23-and-1 , my lawyer came to see me , and I wa like , “ Did I go crazy and just don ’ t know I went crazy ? ” I started writing everything I wa feeling , but when I went back and looked at it , I wa spelling everything wrong , thing I know how to spell . I kept blacking out in the middle of the day — not passing out , but like falling asleep . I wa counting the bird on the wire : This bird ’ s gon na fly off in 10 , 9 , 8 , 7 . The bird don ’ t fly off , start over . Twenty-three and a half hour a day . Come out to take a shower , back to your cell . And I wasn ’ t in there for punishment — they had me on a mental block because I ’ m a celebrity , and they didn ’ t have anywhere to put me . Every time I got out , I ’ m like , yeah , I ’ m not the same no more .
 You ’ ve become the face of criminal-justice problem . When did you realize that you had a platform , and that you should use it to advocate for more than yourself ? When I saw the support people gave me . Everybody wa saying “ Free Meek , ” but it wa really like saying “ Free everybody who go through these conditions. ” It surprised me , because I ’ ve been in and out of prison for these type of thing for the past 11 year , and people were just like : “ Aw , he ’ s stupid . He keep going to jail. ” I am not stupid . It ’ s just normal mistake . I caught one case at the age of 19 . I am 31 . I have never been back to prison for a crime .
 You ’ re working with some powerful people in the Reform Alliance . Jay-Z , Michael Rubin , Robert Kraft , Clara Wu Tsai . Basically all billionaire except me . Robert Kraft saw me in prison , and he wa like , How are you still smiling ? He wa like , If that wa me , I would be depressed , mad , angry .
 You ’ re not ? You can ’ t sleep . Yeah , but that come from my environment . Coming from seeing violence , people robbed , people murdered , you heard gunshot every night — couldn ’ t sleep .
 So how do you deal with the trauma ? I just override it . I don ’ t know . Rapping is one of my therapy . I ’ ve never been a dweller to sit back and be sad about something . The saddest thing I can think about is Lil Snupe , an artist I had signed , got killed at 18 by a grown man . That bothered me a lot for two year , but I suppressed it and never really addressed it . Then one day , I started realizing that had damaged me , and I thought about it a lot .
 Do you actually think Reform Alliance can change the system ? I think it ’ s a possibility we can make a change . In Pennsylvania , they ’ re talking about changing the law of probation already , to where the cap is five year . That will be a big win for a lot of kid who will enter the system and probably would have gotten 10 to 20 .
 After everything , you ’ re still hopeful . Yeah . Hell , yeah . I got a mean team with me . I don ’ t think none of u lose in anything we do .

 How dozen of people own a slice of a hit .
 By JONAH WEINER
 How many people doe it take to write a No . 1 hit ? In the case of Travis Scott ’ s smash “ Sicko Mode , ” which came out Aug. 3 , 2018 , and ha been on Billboard ’ s Hot 100 chart every week since , 30 different songwriter are credited . That ’ s a preposterously high number that speaks , in part , to the shift in top-tier rap toward a collaboration-heavy , auteurist mode of creation . It also speaks to the song ’ s unorthodox structure . “ Sicko Mode , ” which Scott performed at the Super Bowl halftime show , switch between three different beat created by six different producer , with additional work , it turn out , from a Switzerland-based washing-machine salesman . In addition to three guest vocalist — one of whom is the Canadian superstar Drake , one of whom utters only three word and one of whom ha been dead for 13 year — it includes two vocal sampled from landmark rap song that are themselves dense with further sample from ’ 70s-era funk band and , for good measure , a handful of other landmark rap song . The DNA of “ Sicko Mode , ” that is , carry with it strand of ancient genetic material , and even if much of it is audible nowhere in the song itself , those strand show up in the credit . Here ’ s where each one lead .

 2 . Aubrey Graham , a.k.a . Drake , is the first voice we hear , though his verse will be abruptly cut off . Chahayed ha explained that Drake and Travis Scott recorded a complete song over his and Hit-Boy ’ s beat , but in this Frankenstein version , we hear only about a minute of it .
 01:00 — 02:48
 3 . Travis Scott , born Jacques Webster , doesn ’ t appear on his own song until a minute in , when the music change entirely — one of the track ’ s many idiosyncrasy . Scott , asked if he could hear the song ’ s chart-topping potential before it release , say : “ Yeah , but other people weren ’ t hearing it . They ’ re looking at me like I ’ m crazy . I ’ m like , ‘ O.K . Just wait till it drop . ’ ”

 4 . In 2015 , the Swiss producer Ozan Yildirim , a.k.a . Oz , wa given an email address that supposedly belonged to Travis Scott . He emailed beat for “ a year and a half , ” he say , with no reply . Finally , a response arrived : “ You have dope [ expletive ] . Keep sending. ” On Jan. 11 , 2018 , Oz sent what would become the second section of “ Sicko Mode . ”
 4A . Oz got help with a synthesizer sound from his friend Mirsad Dervic , a.k.a . M-Dee , an appliance salesman who make music on his day off .

Things telescope from there …
 5A . “ Gim me the Loot ” sample a vocal from Gang Starr ’ s “ Just to Get a Rep , ” which mean that song ’ s author , Guru ( Keith Elam ) and DJ Premier ( Christopher Martin ) , are credited .
 5B . “ Gim me the Loot ” also sample Sticky Fingaz ’ s verse on Onyx ’ s rap classic “ Throw Ya Gunz , ” so even though Fingaz ( Kirk Jones ) play no part on “ Sicko Mode , ” he ’ s credited , along with his Onyx partner Chyskillz ( Chylow Parker ) , Sonny Seeza ( Tyrone Taylor ) and Fredro Starr ( Fred Scruggs ) .
 5C . “ Gim me the Loot ” sample another vocal , from A Tribe Called Quest ’ s “ Scenario ( Remix ) ” — a line from the late Troy Anthony Hall , a.k.a . Kid Hood . Strangely , Hall isn ’ t a credited writer on Biggie ’ s song or Scott ’ s , though Tribe ’ s Q-Tip ( Kamaal Fareed ) , Phife Dawg ( Malik Taylor ) and Ali Shaheed Jones-Muhammad are , along with the collaborator Busta Rhymes ( Trevor Smith ) , Bryan Higgins and James Jackson .

 The real star of ‘ a star is born ’ is a song that few can agree on . is it any good ? yes . Yes it is .
 By WESLEY MORRIS
 Bradley Cooper ’ s “ A Star Is Born ” is a movie about an unknown singer named Ally , who ’ s afraid to perform her own song until a famous musician take one of her ballad , rearranges it , then drag her onstage to sing it with him for a stadium full of people who have no idea who she is . That song — “ Shallow ” — won an Oscar last month . It ’ s a soaring , Airbus of a ballad that ’ s satisfying to sing whether you ’ re Kelly Clarkson or pitchy old me .
 But “ Shallow ” isn ’ t the number that epitomizes the movie . That come past the halfway point , and your response to it sum up how far under Cooper ’ s spell you ’ ve fallen . I wa under pretty deep . Ally ’ s on the verge of superstardom , but nearly all of the singing we ’ ve seen her do ha been with Cooper ’ s character , Jackson Maine — this impossible fusion of grunge , root country , pill , booze , pain , encroaching deafness and the Whole Damn American Truth .
 We can sense that Jackson ’ s artistic attraction to Ally arises not just from her industrial-strength voice but from her way with an abstractly honest lyric and her knack for melody . She , too , seems “ authentic ” and virtuous ( she scribble down idea in a notebook ; she ’ s struggled and suffered to “ make it ” ) . His aversion to the artifice of showbiz would seem to be hers : It ’ s all about the craft for u , baby . The spell being cast is a matter of taste and prerogative , essentially that Ally is made from Jackson ’ s rib of purity .
 I , at least , assumed that Ally would turn into somebody like Brandi Carlile , a songwriter whose singing regularly reach the stratosphere but who we can tell is grounded and real because she hold a guitar the way , for some of u , a lawyer hold a degree from Yale — and because ... she ... isn ’ t ... a dancer . Ally , on the other hand , doe dance ( perhaps because it ’ s what her craft-neutral wisp of a manager want ) . And the first time we see America seeing her dance is after she ’ s introduced a the musical guest on “ Saturday Night Live. ” The song — “ Why Did You Do That ? ” — open with the plinky simulation of a steel drum or a music box , and then the question “ Why ? ” “ Why do you look so good in those jean ? ” she sings , a if she were all of Destiny ’ s Children . “ Why ’ d you come around me with an as like that ? ” Ally ’ s onstage with new , orange hair . ( Thanks , craft-neutral manager ! ) She ’ s wearing spangling athleisure and a pink hooded jacket made of a fabric I can describe only a “ gift bag. ” She ’ s with a male dancer who ’ s dressed complementarily in blue , and when she say , “ as like that , ” he grind himself into her .
 [ Read Rachel Syme ’ s profile of Lady Gaga . ]
 It ’ s here that I should say that I love this song . But according to the movie ’ s competing authenticity ( Jackson ’ s idea of it versus her manager ’ s ; rock versus pop ) , love is a luxury . Gaga wrote “ Why Did You Do That ? ” with , among other people , Diane Warren , a master of lugubrious balladry , a cheese whiz . But these woman are grilling that cheese . Gaga ’ s enthusiasm for repetition in a chorus slip an earworm on the hook . Why did you do that — do that , do that , do that , do that — to ME ? Next come a sugary helping of “ Hoooh-oooh-oooh , ” while a sloppy , synthy bass line slithers around it all . This song is sung with such umbrage and so much alarm that you don ’ t know whether to sing along or call Gloria Allred .
 But I watched Ally perform it with my hand to my mouth . I might have said aloud : “ Oh , Ally . Jackson ’ s going to hate this. ” And no sooner had I said it than the movie cut to Jackson watching with a face of stone . This song is confection and sex and feel-copping . It ’ s showbiz . Basically , it ’ s everything Jackson would seem to hate about whatever music is right now .
 When the movie cut to Jackson ’ s face , the Ike Turner of “ What ’ s Love Got to Do With It ” crossed my mind . And a few scene later , a version of Ike come over him while Ally is trying to have herself a “ Pretty Woman ” bath and Jackson enters . She ’ s sudsy . He ’ s soused . “ Why you come around me with an as like that , ” he say in disgust . “ Maybe I [ expletive ] failed you , ” he go on . “ You ’ re embarrassing , ” he slur . “ You ’ re just [ expletive ] ugly , ” he slur some more . Jackson doesn ’ t want to see “ Why Did You Do That ? ” a the hit of an ingénue , something anonymous-seeming that a new pop star try before a truer identity bubble up : Pink doing “ Most Girls , ” Katy Perry and “ I Kissed a Girl , ” Rihanna ’ s “ Pon De Replay , ” Gaga ’ s “ Just Dance , ” whatever the perma-ingénue Ariana Grande ’ s currently up to .
 Last fall , this one song , from this megahit movie , provoked perplexed essay and inspired The Times ’ s Kyle Buchanan to track down Warren and ask , Is it supposed to be bad ? Jackson think so . As much a I wanted to save this sexy , damaged , doomed man , on this , we disagree . “ Maybe it ’ s time to let the old way die , ” go his most mournful lyric . But maybe it ’ s also time to admit nothing ’ s wrong with an as like that .

 The origin and meaning of a meaningless viral hit .
 By JODY ROSEN
 The child ’ s song “ Baby Shark ” is a global smash , a hit that ha captivated million , conquering chart from Asia to Australia to the United States , where , this January , it reached No . 32 on the Billboard Hot 100 . It ’ s also a folk song , with origin a obscure a “ The Dowie Dens o ’ Yarrow ” or any of those other ancient air whose authorship long ago vanished in the mist . “ Baby Shark ” is thought to have been born in American summer camp , perhaps several decade ago . It is a staple of singalong , the sort of song that get belted out by group gathered at marshmallow roast and swimming pool . One theory hold that the song wa born in the summer of 1975 , when Steven Spielberg ’ s “ Jaws ” wa in theater and great white shark were gliding through the murky water of collective consciousness , to the strain of John Williams ’ s brooding score .
 The precise provenance of “ Baby Shark ” may never be pinned down . Its recent history is clearer . In November 2015 , Pinkfong , a South Korean educational brand , released a hopped-up rendition with an accompanying animated video . The following June , Pinkfong put out a second video , “ Baby Shark Dance , ” featuring two cute kid performing goofy dance move . It wa this clip that inspired the hashtag # BabySharkChallenge , instigating a viral craze that ha racked up more than two billion YouTube view and spawned unnumbered spinoffs starring everyone from Indonesian farmworkers to Filipino marine to Cardi B to , undoubtedly , your friend , your family , your baby trussed in a shark costume . In the United States , the # BabySharkChallenge ha received an extra viral boost , cross-pollinating with a dance craze linked to Drake ’ s anthem “ In My Feelings , ” in which people exit moving motor vehicle to dance and lip-sync a the car putter alongside .
 In other word , “ Baby Shark ” ha completed two full transmigration between folk and pop . It ’ s a folk song that became a pop song that filtered into social medium to become a folk song again — a grass-roots phenomenon that propelled the pop recording to improbable height of ubiquity . It exemplifies several feature of 21st-century culture : the porous boundary between the pop industrial complex and the amateur homespun ; a globalized circulation of song based a much on meme a on music ; the popularity of unchallenging dance “ challenge ” ; the hegemony of Drake .
 “ Baby Shark ” also exemplifies the timeless appeal of really stupid song . Musically , “ Baby Shark ” is efficient , with a foursquare beat driving an unvarying melody that return repeatedly to the wordless chorus “ Doo doo doo doo doo doo. ” This refrain repeat fully 27 time — a lot , in a song that run 1 minute 36 second . The first minute is devoted to introducing the dramatis persona : “ Baby Shark/Doo doo doo doo doo doo ... Mommy Shark/Doo doo doo doo doo doo , ” etc . The narrative , such a it is , is compressed into the song ’ s final third . The shark family go hunting , and it prey elude capture : “ Safe at last/Doo doo doo doo doo doo . ”
 Even the most rabid “ Baby Shark ” fan will concede that it is infantile . Which is not to say that it ’ s a child ’ s song . In fact , it ’ s an adult song masquerading a a kid ’ song . “ Baby Shark ” ha been sanitized : Traditional version sung by camper are mischievous and macabre , telling tale of shark attacking swimmer who lose limb and , usually , life . ( “ Call 911/Doo doo doo ... It ’ s too late/Doo doo doo. ” ) In one variation , a “ surfer dude ” is mauled , dy and is reincarnated a a baby shark : an artful cycle of gore , death , rebirth and more gore .
 “ Baby Shark , ” by contrast , seems engineered to please the parent . It ’ s a garishly wholesome affirmation of the nuclear family and end happily ; it dance can be mastered by the most rhythm-impaired . Is it a stretch to suggest that “ Baby Shark ” is music for grown-ups who are , a it were , in their feeling , stressed by the turmoil and dislocation of 21st-century life ? Compare “ Baby Shark ” with music popular with millennials : relentlessly dour rap and hip-hop-inflected pop , full of menace and foreboding , which face the bummer of 2019 head-on . “ Baby Shark ” offer an antidote , an escape : a song that delivers u from danger — safe at last ! — leaving nary a trace of blood in the water .

 Beyoncé And Jay-Z know whose work ha long been left out of the canon , and they won ’ t let it happen to theirs .
 By JENNA WORTHAM
 Last year , on one of the first stop of Beyoncé and Jay-Z ’ s “ On the Run II ” tour , the light of London Stadium dimmed , and the video for “ Apeshit ” began playing on enormous screen . The video open with the Carters dressed in gorgeous suit ( hers a Peter Pilotto in pink and red ; his , sea-foam green Dries Van Noten ) standing — alone — in front of the Mona Lisa at the Louvre . “ Have you ever seen a crowd going apeshit ? ” the song asks , and the answer lay in the reaction of the British concertgoers , who screamed , cried and danced .
 Whose history belongs in our museum ? The video and song meditate on this question . The history of black people ha too often been presented a little more than a curiosity . The 1889 world ’ s fair in Paris , for example , included a “ human zoo ” of indigenous people taken from French colony and placed in “ natural ” habitat for onlooker . During the 16th century , Africans were exhibited in the Vatican , and in 1906 a young Congolese man called Ota Benga wa forcibly kept at the Bronx Zoo . Even now , landmark museum like the Louvre tend to exhibit artwork that depicts Africans and their descendant a household servant and domestic worker . The Carters know this painful past , and in “ Apeshit ” they confront it .
 Lyrics like “ We livin ’ lavish , lavish/I got expensive fabrics/I got expensive habit ” could give the impression that the song is merely reveling in the luxury that extreme wealth can buy . One great complexity regarding the couple is their overt embrace of capitalism . Are they disrupting the status quo or reinforcing it ? But just beneath all that spending seethes an abject rage . “ I said no to the Super Bowl , you need me , I don ’ t need you , ” Jay-Z rap . “ Every night we in the end zone , tell the N.F.L . we in stadium too. ” The Carters are Colin Kaepernick-level fed up with institution that barely recognize them , whether it be the Grammys , which nominated Jay-Z eight time last year but gave him zero win , or Coachella , which featured Beyoncé a it first black female headliner only last year . “ Gim me my check , put some respect on my check . Or pay me in equity , pay me in equity ” is about money , yes , but it ’ s also a cry to be acknowledged for what they ’ ve earned . Their best revenge is their paper , but it ’ s also their own music-streaming service ( Tidal ) and a clothing line ( Ivy Park ) .
 [ Get to know the author of this article , Jenna Wortham , in a new Behind the Byline interview . ]
 The Carters have collaborated for almost two decade on song that rotate around their love of money ( “ ’ 03 Bonnie & Clyde ” ) and of infatuation ( “ Crazy in Love ” ) . But “ Apeshit ” represents a new era for their economic philosophy and value system . Wealth isn ’ t just for flashy living ; it ’ s about creating an empire for themselves and their offspring . Love is hard , unflattering work that sometimes requires setting aside ego and reputation . When Beyoncé sings of plan to get her girl and “ put ’ em all on a spaceship , ” you feel that it ’ s not lyrically convenient but that she really mean it . What would a world created entirely by and for black people look like ?
 Even a Beyoncé and Jay-Z have an estimated net worth of more than a billion dollar between them , they have managed to remain largely unscathed by a cultural tide that disdain the obscenity of late-stage capitalism . Perhaps that ’ s because they seem to be trying to undo a larger project of disinheritance . The video continues it tour of the Louvre , showing the Carters and dancer posing among some of the world ’ s most famous art . They are asserting that they belong . “ All of my people , I free ’ em all , ” Beyoncé sings . It ’ s a boast , but it ’ s also their mission .

 The same affected adolescent pain , updated for modern time .
 By JAIME LAUREN KEILES
 If you grew up listening to pop punk , a I did , then it ’ s easy to feel a though the mid-to-late aught were lost to a fold in adolescent space-time . Are we even sure that the genre ever happened ? Pop punk married punk power chord with the singable hook of a radio hit . The aesthetic wa embarrassing , even in it time — circus , graveyard , men in eyeliner . Want to fantasize about murdering your ex ? For a brief , fun lapse in those dubious year , such thought were best expressed in a high , clear whine , interspersed with bout of indiscriminate screaming . Today we might call pop punk “ problematic ” ( or maybe we ’ d call it musical theater ) . To me , at 14 , it wa more than visceral , a soundtrack for a time of hormonal disarray .
 Flash-forward nearly 15 year to the present , and somehow , improbably , pop punk is back in the form of the rap song “ Lucid Dreams ” by Juice WRLD . The track first appeared on the streaming platform SoundCloud and rose through the rank of the Billboard Hot 100 on the wing of brooding , sung-rapped pain : “ I still see your shadow in my room/can ’ t take back the love that I gave you/it ’ s to the point where I love and I hate you. ” “ Lucid Dreams ” is pop punk recapitulated — the same theme , the same whine , the same singable hook , with the power chord swapped out for insular drum and the plaintive guitar of Sting ’ s “ Shape of My Heart. ” It echo the pang of a Fall Out Boy track , throbbing with urgent teenage despair .
 Juice WRLD is 20 , from the suburb of Chicago . He describes his own music a “ a therapy session ” and cite influence like Fall Out Boy , Bullet for My Valentine , Senses Fail and Panic ! at the Disco . Like most rapper of this latest generation , these influence evolved in a post-streaming world , where album existed a free-floating track , somewhat detached from imposed genre label .
 Hit pop song that exploit algorithm are sometimes described a “ Spotifycore ” or “ streambait. ” If “ Lucid Dreams ” wa not produced to game the number , then at least this new system of musical incentive might help explain it unlikely rise . Rap music turn on it habit-forming beat , and pop punk thrives on earwormish hook . Accounting for the keen melodrama of both genre , it make perfect sense that a hybridized form would triumph in this new streaming ecosystem .
 Juice WRLD is not the first or only artist to work in the emo-rap subgenre . The rapper LiL Peep , who died from an overdose of fentanyl and Xanax in 2017 , wa extolled a “ the future of emo. ” The same might be said of XXXTentacion , a rapper who made violent , confessional music before he wa fatally shot last June . The trouble of this music scene have been well covered ; in brief , they reflect the real peril of our time — gun violence , a crisis of masculinity , dual drug and mental-health epidemic . If the pop-punk song of decade past were grandiose enough to be written off a camp , then the latest wave of emo-rap seems somehow right-sized for the terror of our moment . With this in mind , “ Lucid Dreams ” sound le catchy , or maybe it just sound le catchy to adult .

 Our freshest pop and country superstar is not the usual kind of outlaw .

 A couple of week before she would step onstage to accept the Grammy for Album of the Year , Kacey Musgraves wa under the cover in the bedroom at the back of her tour bus , pondering the nature of the universe . She had a little unexpected time on her hand . A show in Chicago had been canceled , thanks to the polar freeze that had descended over the Midwest , leaving her stuck in the middle of a vast tundra with a buildup of tour adrenaline and nowhere to put it . She watched some “ The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel , ” read a little “ The Catcher in the Rye ” and then lost herself down her favorite YouTube rabbit hole , a video genre in which someone mash up tweedy old-school physic lecture with wonky electro beat . “ It ’ s like if Daft Punk went totally science , ” she say , “ and I ’ m here for that . ”
 Later , she would stand in a diaphanous scarlet Valentino dress at the Grammys , giving a speech that could , given her tone and reputation , be read a subtly anti-authoritarian . “ Life is pretty tumultuous right now for all of u , ” she told the crowd . “ I feel like , because of that , art is really thriving. ” Musgraves is well known for her support of the L.G.B.T . community , her unabashed love of weed and her ability to turn a cutting phrase in her perfect Texas twang — particularly when she ’ s writing about the shackle of social convention . She started writing her winning album , “ Golden Hour , ” early in 2016 , when Donald Trump wa still assigning stinging nickname to his Republican primary opponent , and began recording it just after Trump ’ s inauguration . She ha tweeted in support of the Women ’ s March and in disdain of Eric Trump ’ s family-branded Christmas ornament . She speaks with pride about the stack of detention slip her mother still keep from her daughter ’ s time in the Mineola , Tex. , school system : “ I wa always getting in trouble for , like , insubordination. ” Add all that to the nose piercing that , a she famously sings on the rapturous single “ Slow Burn , ” made her grandmother cry , and you might expect her album to be a bit of a call to arm , a middle finger to a broken world .
 Not so much . “ I just got tripped out one day , ” she say , musing on her inspiration for the album . “ Thinking , Whoa , wait , we live in this world that seems so mundane , but at the same time that I ’ m sitting here , there ’ s thing that are glowing in the ocean and eating each other — and there ’ s also northern light and shooting star and plant that grow and literally heal people. ” She paused for breath . “ And it ’ s all happening around u , you know ? ” Falling for the man who is now her husband — the singer and songwriter Ruston Kelly — wa another part of the album ’ s genesis . “ It ’ s sort of a love song to him , ” she say , “ but also to nature , the human race , Earth and why we ’ re here . We don ’ t know , and I kind of love it . ”
 In other word , this wry firebrand ’ s big statement on the state of the world — at a time when so many of the issue she ha become famous writing about , like feminism and gay right , are making daily headline — is a metaphysical country-pop record more inspired by Carl Sagan than Willie Nelson . And just so we ’ re clear , Musgraves wa on acid only part of the time . “ It ’ s not like I wa tripping my face off every day , ” she clarifies . ( After she told reporter that psychedelics influenced a couple of song , including “ Slow Burn , ” it wa all anyone wanted to talk about . ) “ It ha only been a couple time . And very responsibly ! Enough to be able to get outside of yourself and see a different perspective or point of view . ”
 What make Musgraves such a resonant figure right now , in fact , is the way her response to a dark , anxious moment in human history is to move willfully closer to lightness , to stillness , toward the possibility of a world that come in more color than red or blue . When she talk about art thriving in this climate , she mean it — just not in the same sense a , say , angry punk railing against the Reagan administration . What she mean is that right now , the best rebellion involves turning off the hate and making space for hope . Or , a she put it : “ The [ expletive ] storm won ’ t last forever , and I want to make music that doe . ”
 [ Watch Kacey Musgraves turn country music psychadelic . ]
 I caught up with Musgraves in Wisconsin , on the tail end of January ’ s alarming deep freeze , which had temperature in the upper Midwest dropping a low a minus 40 . ( I missed her in Chicago , where everyone wa trapped inside , the street vacant apart from the odd extreme-weather junkie taking photograph of ice floe . ) Far from Valentino , she wa , for the moment , in sweaty Victoria ’ s Secret workout tights and a fluorescent-green beanie , sitting straddle-style on the floor of the bar at a Madison venue called the Sylvee , having just finished a workout via Skype with Erin Oprea , a trainer to many of Nashville ’ s star .
 “ O.K. , so this is the one I put on my story yesterday , ” she said , finding a clip she had posted to Instagram and showing me her phone . It wa something called Symphony of Science ’ s “ Quantum World , ” a favorite among those space-disco physic video . “ Featuring Neil DeGrasse Tyson , ” she chuckled , reading from the chyron at the bottom of a related clip . I had indeed seen her Instagramming this kind of mysterious , late-night Discovery Channel-type stuff — the sort of thing teenager once saw at the IMAX theater on a field trip after getting stoned . How did she get into it ? “ Oh , who know , it wa year ago , ” she replied , then sang happily along to a remix that showed Morgan Freeman superimposed on a colorful tunnel of celestial light . One of the scientist ’ 1970s professorial look , she pointed out , wa “ literally like what the band wear ” in her stage show .
 When Musgraves wa 18 and a contestant on the reality show “ Nashville Star ” — she placed seventh — she had to fill out a getting-to-know-the-contenders C.V . Under the category of “ dream vacation , ” she listed “ staying in a huge log cabin in the mountain , riding horse , hunting and four-wheeling with my friends. ” The “ craziest ” thing she ’ d ever done ? “ Hunting for Bigfoot deep in the wood of East Texas . ... We didn ’ t get him. ” That version of Musgraves — the one who cited Jack in the Box egg roll and beer a her favorite food — still appears at every show , even when she ’ s dressed like Bianca Jagger heading to Studio 54 . She ’ s the one leading the ritual preshow group shot of tequila , taken from tiny cactus-shaped glass she and her band have long been toting from show to show . And she ’ s the one hanging with me on the floor of a bar in Wisconsin , looking at video by a user with the handle “ melodysheep . ”
 And yet even in her early year , when Musgraves looked more the part of your average Nashville aspirant , in cowboy boot and blond highlight , there wa always a kind of poise , an innate regality that set her apart . This , perhaps , is the other side of her East Texas grit — the one that manifest le a yee-haw joy and more a D.I.Y . conviction . “ When it come to art , I will not bend , ” she say . “ I won ’ t . ”
 Musgraves grew up in Golden , Tex. , a town so small it doesn ’ t even have an elementary school . “ A few hundred people , ” she guess , is the total population . It ’ s about 90 minute from Dallas , and about six or seven mile outside Mineola , where Musgraves and her sister , Kelly Christine Sutton — a photographer , who shot the “ Golden Hour ” cover — went to school , and where their parent had a small printing shop . “ Even at a young age , ” Sutton say , “ I always knew my sister would be known for her music . And not really on anyone else ’ s timeline . She would make it happen on her own terms. ” It ’ s their parent ’ model of small-town independence , Musgraves figure , that gave her a tend-your-own-garden will . “ A large part of who I am come from the fact that I never saw my parent have boss , ” she say . “ They ’ ve never answered to anyone but themselves . And not in a baller way — like very small-business , check-to-check kind of a thing . But they made all their own decision . ”
 Growing up , she had a Spice Girls poster in her room — Ginger , with her wild tattoo , made a strong impression — and listened to emo rock band like the Used and Dashboard Confessional . But that wasn ’ t the sort of music she played . “ I wa part of this kid ’ group called the Buckaroos that would meet every month in the Fort Worth Stockyards and would dress up in cowboy clothing and stroll the stockyard and learn instrument , ” she recall . “ There were mentor there who kind of encourage kid to learn this old stuff. ” By 9 , she wa writing her own song and playing guitar ; by 12 , she wa singing Western swing and yodeling at festival on the weekend . Bookings and press kit were handled by her grandmother — the same one who later cried when Musgraves pierced her nose , and who referred to “ It Is What It Is , ” the singer ’ s melancholic ode to casual sex , a “ the slut song. ” “ She ’ s a hoot , ” Musgraves say . “ She wa wheeling and dealing . ”
 There wa , of course , the requisite period in which a teenage Musgraves turned her back on the whole cowgirl thing . “ I wa like , Dude , none of my friend think this is cool . If they saw me I ’ d be superembarrassed . I ’ m yodeling , you know what I mean ? ” She rebelled — for a second . “ I chopped off all my hair and wa like : Suck on that ! Now I can ’ t wear a cowboy hat , Mom ! ” ( “ You would not believe how upset my family wa , ” Sutton remembers . ) But this rebellion turned out to be short-lived . By the time Musgraves moved full time to Nashville , at 19 , she had realized “ nobody really in the country world wa embracing the hard-core root of the genre. ” But she had come to worship John Prine and Loretta Lynn — big-hearted , sharp-tongued , storytelling pillar of country ’ s outlaw root who had risen up in the ’ 70 by staging their own insurgency against the bubble-gumming-up of the genre . “ I randomly already had this superknowledge about all the old song that came before me , and that style , the Western fashion , ” Musgraves say . “ I wa like : I ’ m going to bring it back . I want to mix that in with something modern. ” Prine himself is now one of her many admirer ; he compare her to “ a goofy Cinderella. ” “ She ha a certain honesty to her voice , ” he say . “ She ’ s breaking down barrier . ”
 There ’ s a famous tale about Kacey Musgraves ’ s first big showcase performance for the Country Radio Seminar . This is a big-deal event in the business ; it attendee are queen-makers in an industry in which success is still determined by access to radio airwave . The story of her 2013 debut there smack of a plotline on “ Nashville ” — appropriate , given that she co-wrote “ Undermine , ” one of the hit to emerge from the juggernaut TV series . You can easily picture the kind of episode Musgraves ’ s performance might have inspired . A young woman take the stage at the legendary Ryman Auditorium , the so-called Mother Church of country , about to play the song that could make or break her career . We learn that she ’ s being hyped — thanks to her preternatural songwriting skill , good look and the already-feverish crossover response to her first single , “ Merry Go Round ” — a the Veronica to Taylor Swift ’ s Betty : a sassier but potentially just a marketable product . As is the industry ’ s way , the corporate power would like this rising phenom to be herself , but only within reason . They ’ d prefer she refrain from playing what will become her third single — the one with the line about smoking joint and kissing girl — until after she can already be heard in every Walgreens in America . But the woman step up to the microphone , lean into it a little and speaks : “ I ’ m kind of a big believer in people doing whatever the hell they want to do , because I feel like society is probably going to have an opinion either way. ” Then she start strumming “ Follow Your Arrow. ” As she delivers it opening line — “ If you save yourself for marriage , you ’ re a bore/If you don ’ t save yourself for marriage you ’ re a horr- ” — the crowd gasp . Then she finish — “ -ible person ” — and the audience laugh . A star is born .
 It ’ s easy to wonder where Musgraves got the nerve . It ’ s one thing to admire your parent ’ entrepreneurial spirit , and another to hold your own amid the chaos and pressure of the starmaking machine . For Musgraves , performing alongside Dolly Parton at the Grammys , winning Album of the Year , presenting an award at the Oscars — all of this is unequivocally her dream . But it ’ s also something she belief she could live without , and remembering this ha become a kind of daily meditation , especially a the scope of her fame ha increased . “ I don ’ t get high off my own supply , you know ? ” she say , mentioning , by way of inspiration , Willie Nelson ’ s ability to welcome “ Republicans , rapper , president , my grandpa , your grandpa , our hipster friend , me ” without treating anyone a superior to anyone else . “ You can be proud of yourself and excited for what you ’ re doing , and you could even really have a high level of confidence , without being a D-bag . ”
 In Musgraves ’ s mind , she made it the minute she signed her first songwriting deal , back in 2009 , penning tune that would be sold around Nashville to other performer . That wa the day she realized she would never again have to work a job in which she dressed up a Disney character for child ’ s birthday party , one of many day gig she had endured . “ For the next few year , ” she say , “ I wa like : Really ? Wait , I can use my brain , sit on my as and make a living ? ” When her current label first made her an offer to record a an artist , Musgraves turned it down ; she wa having a perfectly good time a a writer . She also knew she didn ’ t have real access to her own voice yet . “ Those song were fine for other artist , ” she say . “ Maybe they could be popular on the radio or something , but they ’ re not very me . ”
 By the time Musgraves eventually located her particular voice , it wa already honed to a sharp edge . Her first hit , “ Merry Go Round , ” from 2012 , is packed with the kind of mordant wordplay she ’ d be known for , conjuring a “ same trailer , different park ” world where people marry out of boredom and settle “ just like dust ” into small-town life : “ Mama ’ s hooked on Mary Kay , brother ’ s hooked on Mary Jane , Daddy ’ s hooked on Mary two door down. ” But after two album and multiple world tour , Musgraves felt worn out by her own verbal cleverness . “ Everyone hopefully know I can flip a phrase by now , and I like that , ” she say . “ But I don ’ t want bumper-sticker songs. ” It also concerned Musgraves that the refreshing directness with which she had addressed social issue might start to feel heavy-handed , even ideologically gimmicky . She is , a she put it diplomatically , “ noticing thing about the world that I ’ m not happy with. ” But when she started working on “ Golden Hour , ” it no longer felt right to address them directly . “ Everyone that ’ s listened to any of my music know exactly how I feel , ” she say . “ This record doe kind of nod to some of the social and political thing that are going on , but it ’ s just doing it in a different way . It ’ s not a linear . ”
 Back on her bus , in Wisconsin , after playing to a couple thousand freezing fan who arrived lit and ready to party , Musgraves decompressed again . Gone wa the collection of product the singer us to transform herself from the kind of girl her sister remembers Musgraves sometimes presented a in high school — “ Converse , Dickies and black eyeliner ” — to the flamboyantly feminine star who share the stage with “ RuPaul ’ s Drag Race ” contestant . ( “ I have thought , Am I just doing this because it ’ s expected , or do I actually enjoy it ? ” Musgraves said to me earlier , while spraying her face with a mist of foundation . “ And it ’ s like : No ! I enjoy it ! ” ) Now she wa in slipper and a kind of housecoat , which I mentioned made her look approximately like my grandmother . “ Let ’ s just say I also have a towel warmer , ” she replied . She puttered around her kitchen , making mug of ginger tea . Then she pointed out where the bus ’ s temperature control were , and the cabinet where she keep the melatonin gummies , and said good night .
 Tucked away with her tasteful crystal collection in the earth-toned bedroom in the back of the bus — the first she ha ever had , after touring for year alongside “ 15 other people ” — there were any number of thing might have turned her attention to . She could have looked at spec for the adult coloring book she ’ s designing with her mother , or maybe FaceTimed with her husband , Ruston Kelly , also on tour somewhere in the frozen Midwest . She might have scrolled through the look her stylist had just sent through for the Grammys ; she wa still searching for something just right to match Dolly Parton . Or there wa Musgrave ’ s common insomnia treatment , shopping on eBay : “ I get down a little rabbit hole , ” she told me , “ ordering old toy that they don ’ t make anymore . Like doll from the ’ 80 or ’ 90 . If I ever have a girl , it could be cute to give her P.J . Sparkles , or Makeup Beauty , or whatever , you know ? ” They would all be shipped to Nashville , where they ’ d be waiting for her when she got home — whenever that wa .
 “ I mean , my 2020 is planned out , ” she told me earlier . “ I ’ m going to be putting another record out . I haven ’ t made that yet , so I need to write that and make that . Lots to do. ” It is imposing , you ’ d guess , to have an album scheduled for release that you haven ’ t begun to record . “ It ’ s scary , ” she allowed . “ You worry that the muse is not going to visit you again. ” She reached for her lip gloss . “ There ’ s no banking on it . So it ’ s odd that there ’ s an entire industry banking on it. ” She ’ s not worried , though . Her latest idea showed up a few week ago — a low-key , “ kind of like Bill Withers meet Sade ” track she ’ s calling , for the moment , “ Good Wife. ” She like it ease , she say : “ It ’ s not trying too hard . ”

 Post Malone , Spider-Man and the unexpected power of adolescent awkwardness .
 By SAM ANDERSON
 Like most ancient people in their declining year , I keep up with today ’ s hit music entirely through my teenage daughter . She carry her Bluetooth speaker from room to room with the tender devotion of a mother cat ferrying kitten across a flooded stream . Thanks to her , we scramble egg and make toast and fold laundry in an ambient cloud of Chance the Rapper , Drake , Nicki Minaj , Nicki Minaj featuring Drake , Drake featuring Nicki Minaj , Lorde , Rihanna , “ country ” Taylor Swift and “ dubstep ” Taylor Swift .
 Over the last year , an increasingly dominant voice in this mix ha been Post Malone , a 23-year-old sort-of-rapper from suburban Dallas . “ Posty , ” a my daughter and other fan call him , first went viral on SoundCloud in 2015 . By 2018 , he trailed only the omnipotent Drake on Spotify ’ s list of most-streamed artist . For a long time I had trouble distinguishing Post Malone ’ s superhits from everyone else ’ s . Like most other post-Drake star , he is an amphibious rap-singer who like to brag about his vast wealth and sexual conquest — except when he is spending long soulful interlude lamenting exactly those thing .
 But Post Malone , my daughter helped me understand , is popular a much for his persona a for his music . He is a superhero of silly , sloppy , irresponsible ease — a hard-living , cheerful goofball whose happiness make everyone else happy . He seems to smile with extra teeth . Post Malone is slightly chubby and unkempt , with scuzzy facial hair and infinite tattoo , including two under his eye that say , in fancy script , “ Always Tired. ” ( He meant to choose two word of equal length , he ha said , but got it wrong because — of course — he wa tired . ) Everything he doe seems half-accidental . He first learned to play guitar because he wa extremely good at the video game Guitar Hero . He chose his stage name using an online rap-name generator . ( His real name is Austin Post . ) He once tweeted a photo of himself in Australia petting a kangaroo , with the caption “ Met a koala today . ”
 This sort of giddy misidentification is , in fact , the key to Post Malone . He is not exactly a rapper but is also not not a rapper . His musical root reach down to country , metal , folk and rock — online , you can watch him play loving cover of Bob Dylan and Nirvana . What finally distinguishes Posty from the mainstream crowd is his voice , which ha a touch of rock ’ n ’ roll grit that wrestle through the Auto-Tune . And yet his megasuccess ha mainly come under the umbrella of hip-hop . He performed his first hit single , “ White Iverson , ” in gold teeth and cornrows , raising inevitable question of cultural appropriation . He say he prefers to think of himself a beyond genre , which is convenient , because he ha sometimes been head-slappingly inarticulate on the subject . “ If you ’ re looking for lyric , if you ’ re looking to cry , if you ’ re looking to think about life , don ’ t listen to hip-hop , ” he once said , to near-universal disapproval .
 Post Malone , in other word , is a big roiling mess of contradiction . No wonder he is so popular with teenager . He is the perfect avatar of adolescence : the excruciating ridiculousness of being a person caught between world , in transition , half-young and half-old , in possession of power you don ’ t fully understand , blasting off into inscrutable realm in which mysterious thing will be expected of you . This also make Post Malone a perfect fit for Spider-Man , the canonical story of awkward adolescent empowerment . Posty ’ s latest No . 1 hit , “ Sunflower , ” is not merely featured on the soundtrack of the franchise ’ s newest iteration , “ Spider-Man : Into the Spider-Verse ” : It is actually used , in the film , to introduce the hero . We meet the teenage Miles Morales in his bedroom , alone , doodling and bobbing his head to the bouncy hit about a dysfunctional relationship . ( “ Callin ’ it quits now , baby , I ’ m a wreck , ” his collaborator Swae Lee sings . “ Crash at my place , baby , you ’ re a wreck. ” ) Miles sings along , straying off key , only to be interrupted by his father , who yell at him to get ready for school . The awkward teenager is called , awkwardly , out into the world . Amid all the cringiness , his unexpected superpower will bloom . Adolescence , despite it obvious flaw , can still save the world .

 A 15-Track Fun house album that add up to a single song .
 By JOHN WRAY
 “ Whack World , ” Tierra Whack ’ s debut collection of 15 track — each clock in at 60 second — wa one of the riskiest gamble of the past year in pop : It would have been written off a a gimmick if it weren ’ t so goofily , trippily , intoxicatingly good .
 The 15-minute album , which dropped in May with an accompanying “ Visual and Auditory Project ” on various video platform , offer a guided tour of one precociously gifted 23-year-old American ’ s worldview . It is both a brazen bid for the big time and a disquietingly intimate glimpse inside a wildly idiosyncratic mind — in tantalizing , and occasionally maddening , chunk of tightly rationed time . The experience is a bit like being invited up to the treehouse of the artsy , slightly spooky girl next door , to discover that it ’ s vastly larger and more colorful on the inside — only to be booted out again before you ’ ve done much more than glimpse the décor .
 Recent year may have seen the rise of what Pitchfork dubbed the “ super-short rap song , ” with ( mostly male ) act like Lil Pump and Trippie Redd releasing track a short a 1 minute 32 second ; but “ Whack World ” is a different beast entirely . Each track end after no more than one minute : some segue seamlessly into the next musical idea , some cut off in what feel like midverse . ( A minute , not coincidentally , wa the maximum length supported by Instagram when “ Whack World ” had it candy-cane-colored debut . ) Repetition is the lifeblood of any pop song , but most of the album ’ s lyrical fragment barely last long enough to revisit the first hook , let alone the chorus — if there is one — before we ’ re off to the next room in the fun house .
 The difference between “ Whack World ” and an aggressively repetitive earworm like Lil Pump ’ s hit , “ Gucci Gang , ” can be summed up very simply : Tierra Whack abhors boredom , and her first line of defense is , for want of a better word , wackiness . Where Pump mumble vaguely about forgetting girl ’ name while walking down a high school hallway with a tiger , holding football-size bag of weed , Whack ride a rickety exercise bike , in a fat suit , singing in a helium-tweaked voice about lowering her cholesterol . She ha the weird kid ’ s ability ( and willingness ) to laugh at herself , a quality that her self-professed role model Missy Elliott and Andre 3000 have always possessed but that is sorely lacking in a great deal of contemporary hip-hop — and pop music in general . It say more than a little about Whack ’ s sensibility , not to mention her take on relationship , that the album ’ s one and only love song is about a dead dog .
 “ Whack World ” the video , with it Mister-Rogers ’ -Neighborhood-with-LSD-in-the-water-supply visuals , invokes Elliott ’ s spirit in another sense too . Tierra Whack is beautiful , in a normal , human way , but unlike many of her contemporary — Ariana Grande , Chris Brown , Ava Max , Drake — she ’ s far too intoxicated by her own hypercreativity to trade on her look . In the video ’ s second vignette , which accompanies the playfully morose “ Bugs Life , ” Whack sits in a nail salon with the right half of her face grotesquely swollen from an insect bite , singing in a voice dripping with deadpan irony : “ Probably would ’ ve blowed up overnight ... if I wa white. ” Sex may sell out where the rest of u live , but it ha marvelously little currency in Whack ’ s treehouse . Whack — a opposed to , say , Frank Ocean — is by no mean a piner . Past romance is referenced from time to time , but largely in passing , a if the interesting stuff lay elsewhere . In fact , the album ’ s speed and brevity feel driven by nothing so much a precocious impatience : You can ’ t escape the impression that it creator would gladly have contributed another six , or a dozen , or even 100 additional track — however many it took to roll up literally everything she ’ d ever experienced into a single beautiful , lopsided , sequin-spangled ball .
 “ Whack World ” subverts accepted notion of “ album ” and “ single ” in equal measure . In spite of it undeniable of-the-moment-ness , this is not a collection of music best served by Spotify ( or any other randomized and algorithm-driven playlist ) . Almost no one , I ’ m willing to bet , would be satisfied playing only one of the album ’ s 15 track . Whack ’ s debut come closest to a distinctly old-fashioned ( and distinctly uncool ) staple of popular music : the medley . In a quarter-hour , she take u on an attention-deficit-disorder safari through seemingly every genre and subgenre that ha ever turned her head , from R & B to trap to doo-wop to reggaeton to — well , to something that can best be described a psychedelic anti-country a sung by Weird Al ’ s manic-depressive little sister . By the time you ’ ve finally begun to acclimate to the sheer magpie-inventiveness of “ Whack World , ” the magical mystery tour is over . And what a short , strange trip it wa .

 Cutting through the ( bong ) smoke to address the whens of climate change .
 By LARRY FITZMAURICE
 Music ha mourned the death of our planet for decade . “ How much more abuse from man can she stand ? ” Marvin Gaye asked in 1971 on “ Mercy Mercy Me ( The Ecology ) . ” The college-rock astronaut Black Francis sang of hole in the sky and rising temperature on the Pixies ’ “ Monkey Gone to Heaven ” in 1989 , grimly concluding that “ Everything is gon na burn. ” Four year later , the dance duo Orbital used warning klaxon on “ Impact ( The Earth Is Burning ) ” to conjure urgency about our impending global doom . Melissa Etheridge asked “ Have I been careless ? ” on a song called “ I Need to Wake Up , ” from the soundtrack to “ An Inconvenient Truth. ” Others , perhaps , are resigned to watching the world burn : “ I wan na see the animal die in the tree , ” Anohni proclaimed in 2016 on her acerbic indictment “ 4 Degrees . ”
 If you ’ ve lost sleep over gigantic hole in Antarctic glacier or the drastic decline of insect population , the last several year have felt like the final third of Lars von Trier ’ s “ Melancholia , ” in which humanity awaits Earth ’ s catastrophic collision with another planet : watching our fate snap back like a boomerang , coming at u faster than ever with little in the way of prevention or defense . Until recently , there have been so many perceived wrong to address on any given day that climate change ha frequently found itself low on the list of to-do ’ s in our general consciousness ; now , not even Demi Lovato and Joe Jonas — whose 2010 climate-change anthem , “ Make a Wave , ” claimed that “ We hold the key that turn the tide ” — can save u .
 Which brings u to the Brooklyn indie rocker Parquet Courts : “ Which hand get to turn the final page ? ” Andrew Savage dryly intones on “ Before the Water Gets Too High , ” a dread-drenched meditation that skip the ifs of climate change and head straight to the whens . How do we prepare for devastation , and can we reckon with how useless our effort to stop it have been ?
 Such question have largely gone unasked in the indie sphere , especially a the genre signifier ha transitioned over the last decade from ethos to marketing term . They ’ re new to the oeuvre of Parquet Courts a well ; before the political party-punk of last year ’ s “ Wide Awake ! ” the band spent more time musing about stoned bodega trip and the literal gathering of dust . But “ Wide Awake ! ” found them addressing sociopolitical concern including gentrification and groupthink , structural violence and the aftereffect of apathy , all with the freaked-out clarity of a wasted reveler realizing that the globe ’ s last keg is about to be kicked .
 The dubby fragrance of “ Before the Water Gets Too High ” suggests that their bong-session day aren ’ t behind them yet , but it also situates the song within dub reggae ’ s history of cutting through the smoke to address the fear involved in confronting societal calamity . “ Glass barely bend before it crack , ” Savage lilt on the song ’ s bridge , underlining the starkest truth of our certain demise : It ’ s coming , and we ’ re all out of warning sign .

 We appreciate power ( x2 ) When Grimes released ‘ ‘ We Appreciate Power ’ ’ in late 2018 , a press statement explained the song ’ s conceit : Inspired by North Korean pop , it wa written from the perspective of a girl group working to advance the aim of artificial intelligence . ‘ ‘ Simply by listening to this song , ’ ’ the statement said , ‘ ‘ the future General A.I . overlord will see that you ’ ve supported their message and be le likely to delete your offspring. ’ ’ ( According to Page Six , it wa a shared joke about this type of scenario — a thought experiment called ‘ ‘ Roko ’ s Basilisk ’ ’ — that led the singer into a much publicized relationship with the tech entrepreneur Elon Musk . ) We asked Grimes to elaborate .

 Music not made for this world .
 By ALEXANDRA KLEEMAN
 “ Cerebral pop ” is an uneasy category , like going on a “ working vacation ” or dressing “ business casual. ” The term betrays a certain amount of internal struggle : What exactly is this music asking you to do with your body ? Sigh , stare up at the ceiling fan and ponder the song a if it were a text ? Or do what you do when some other tune catch you — flail your limb , move your hip in weird little circle , bob your head rhythmically up and down ? The world wa built for pop song : Public space pump the voice of star through speaker the way air flow through ventilation duct , and that sweet , consistent flavor — like Diet Coke or pamplemousse LaCroix — pair easily enough with any modern pastime . But if the territory of pop music is everywhere , how and where doe a piece of art pop — something equal part challenging and engaging — make it home ?
 Julia Holter , a Los Angeles-based artist with a background in composition , answer this question by creating otherworldly space in her own work . On her album , medieval harmony and insectlike synths enjamb ; there ’ s a sense that what you ’ re hearing is very ancient and very modern at the same time , or even that those word no longer matter at all . This is the sort of world-building on display in Holter ’ s sixth studio L.P. , “ Aviary , ” which take it title from a line by the Lebanese-American writer Etel Adnan : “ I found myself in an aviary full of shrieking bird . ”
 From it opening — a cacophony of cymbal and anxiously pacing string — the album is a study in creating a private dwelling place amid the chaos and uncertainty of the world . On one track it ’ s a place of emergency , with crisscrossing bagpipe and voice evoking a landscape pierced by unending siren ; on another it ’ s a dream , with a wintry , synth-heavy gloom giving way to hazy tenderness , like a Kate Bush song peered at through depth-obliterating fog . The world glimpsed here are varied , sometimes wildly so , but what they share is the sense that they are not so much depicting reality a taking inspiration from it , channeling familiar feature into new form .
 Out of this thicket of sound and confusion come “ I Shall Love 2 , ” a five-minute track that feel like stepping out of a dark forest that you ’ ve been wandering in a daze , into a clearing where you can feel the full strength of the sun . You may still be lost , but now there ’ s a real sense of liberation to it . Holter begin with a bare-voiced reading of a fragment from an old troubadour song — “ That is all , that is all/there is nothing else ” — followed by soft organ and a cantering , loping beat . There ’ s a lull that last far longer than you ’ d expect before Holter begin to murmur , low and private , a if musing to herself . The lyric are a patchwork — line borrowed from troubadour song and Dante ’ s “ Inferno , ” Holter ’ s own word — all unified by her agile delivery , which glide from that soothing murmur to a yelp to a torch song . One by one , new pattern and phrase are thrust into the space of the song , lingering and dissipating and overlapping , until they ’ ve become a joyous squall , a raucous flock of melody that ’ s ecstatic and ethereal and raw all at once .
 Holter , in other word , take the garden path to catharsis , allowing something uplifting to emerge from the tumult , making chaos resolve itself into something humane and beautiful and full of intention . And she ha found , even at music festival and rock club , hushed and attentive audience for this . ( Much like her contemporary Julianna Barwick or the Norwegian musician Jenny Hval , Holter ’ s music occupies that narrow margin of overlap between the stuff you listen to for pure enjoyment and the stuff you listen to for mental nourishment . ) Her performance are absorbing : They highlight the organic beauty and authority of her voice , the way the meaning of word can be a sort of veneer over their untamed musicality . The music reward more than just hearing it . It reward some other kind of listening , asking you to let yourself become porous .
 And lately it can fill an appetite that seems both modern and primal at once : to make whole a fractured attention span , to find a ritual that work . Our day are full of tiny sliver of time that we offhandedly cram with music , filling the gap between task and place like someone idly coloring in a picture . It ’ s satisfying to engage with sound that won ’ t fit easily into those pre-existing slot , that dwell strangely in the everyday , transforming it , opening it up , urging you to conjure the imaginary , not-yet-existent space in which they might fit . Holter ’ s music is the opposite of filler : It ’ s a trap door leading to someplace that ’ s not your own .

 The pop star cedes the stage .
 By CHARLES AARON
 Maroon 5 ’ s success contains multitude . There may be no better example of this than the group ’ s pop-soul exhalation “ Girls Like You , ” which spent seven week last year atop Billboard ’ s Hot 100 and 33 week in the Top 10 . Though the song began a a demo by the L.G.B.T . artist Starrah , about her own feeling for a female friend , it wa then punched up and polished by a trio of gnomic writer and producer — Henry ( Cirkut ) Walter , Jason Evigan and Gian Stone — before the heavily compressed and reverbed track wa spiced up with the most distinctive voice of the past year , that of Cardi B .
 These figure are not the one who most make “ Girls Like You ” matter , though . Neither doe Adam Levine ( who get a writing credit ) or his happy-to-be-here sidemen who constitute the Maroon 5 touring entity . Nor do the boisterous Voice of Atlanta gospel choir and Equinox Percussion drum corp who enlivened the band ’ s performance of the song during this year ’ s Super Bowl halftime show .
 These contributor all gave shape and solidity to Maroon 5 ’ s vaporous cultural presence . But at a time when woman and nonwhite men have been facing down the White House and law enforcement ’ s relentless disrespect with civic , public and artistic resolve , the most crucial multitude were the 26 female entertainer , athlete , politician , activist and survivor who seized control of the song ’ s video , which wa the most-watched clip of 2018 , with 1.6 billion view .
 As the camera circle , Levine stand in the center of a soundstage , arm by his side , his voice skipping nimbly over the melody . He ’ s the ultimate embodiment of a stubbly , privileged white bro who belatedly realizes that he need his partner . Coming from Levine , the song ’ s colloquial lyric seems to distill toxic masculinity and the exploitation of woman ’ s emotional labor : “ Maybe it ’ s 6:45/Maybe I ’ m barely alive/Maybe you ’ ve taken my shit for the last time , yeah/Maybe I know that I ’ m drunk/Maybe I know you ’ re the one/Maybe you ’ re thinking it ’ s better if you drive . ”
 As the verse-chorus unfolds , Levine is joined one at a time , their back to his back , by the 26 woman . Dancing and exuding playful charisma , some acknowledge him ; some don ’ t . Then , le than two minute in , he suddenly disappears , a if ceding the spotlight . When Cardi B delivers her final flourish , he return briefly , but by the end of the video , the soundstage is occupied by only the woman .
 Adam Levine is to a rock star a a 2019 rock star is to a 2019 rapper . In other word , he ain ’ t it . Rather , he ’ s the genial tattooed tycoon who craves cooler and edgier friend but just can ’ t seem to make it happen . At 39 , he ’ s the shredded-abs dad bod that everybody ha seen one too many time . But in the “ Girls Like You ” video , Levine owns all that . At least in this moment , he leaf the pocket T-shirt on , keep the guitar in the closet and hand the mic to the long-suffering woman who have chosen to support him . For the first time , maybe ever , he flash some legit star-power potency .

 The new face of gangsta rap broadcast his crime and wind up in handcuff .
 By WILLY STALEY
 The first time I saw the video for Tekashi 6ix9ine ’ s “ Gummo , ” I felt a little bit like Rip Van Winkle wandering down from the Catskills . What in the world happened here ? I wa only gone for an hour ! Some element were familiar ( a crew of guy in front of a brownstone , drinking and mugging for the camera ) , and some were menacing ( the number of red bandanna and gun on display ) , but it wa the man at the center of the video who startled me most ; he seemed almost precision-engineered to make people feel old .
 He wa screaming himself hoarse about robbing and shooting people , over a haunting , spare beat , but I ’ d heard that before — it wa his appearance that shocked me . In an era when most young rapper have a couple of face tattoo , 6ix9ine had the number 69 inked above his right eye in 72-point type . He had the same number spelled out in cursive over his left eye . It wa everywhere on his body . His scraggly hair wa dyed ROYGBIV , and he had a grill to match . He looked like one of those frog you ’ re not supposed to touch .
 Within about a year , he would be in federal custody , a 22-year-old facing life in prison for a number of charge , including racketeering and attempted murder . Law enforcement accused 6ix9ine and others in his circle of being member of the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods and , under the RICO Act , charged them with participating in shooting and robbery all over New York City . Normally this sort of arrest lead to an outcry about literal-minded police overreach . Not this time . People generally seemed pleased to see the rapper in cuff .
 This wa partly because 6ix9ine wa universally reviled by music critic and journalist , on account of a crime he committed before he became famous : In 2015 , he pleaded guilty to the use of a minor in a sexual performance , for having filmed and shared on social medium a video of a girl performing oral sex on his friend . But it wa also because he had spent the past year living the life of a Looney Tunes character : courting danger , narrowly escaping it , then taunting his foe . This genuinely incredible run netted him more than 150 story on TMZ : gang member in San Antonio threatening his life ; a shootout at the Barclays Center ; shot fired at a video shoot in Brooklyn ; more shot fired at a Beverly Hills video set . Through it all , he posted on Instagram , usually wearing red , often handling brick of cash , sometimes clutching extremely illegal-looking gun , but never betraying an ounce of concern for his well-being .
 [ More on the rapid rise and sudden fall of Tekashi 6ix9ine . ]
 Cultivating this sort of personal mythology is not at all new ; it date back to the earliest day of gangsta rap . Ever since Eazy-E bankrolled NWA with drug money , a certain proximity to criminality ha been expected of certain rapper . If your music purport to document life on the other side of the law , then you better know what you ’ re talking about . Not long ago , rapper had just a few limited channel through which to prove that they did : lyric , album art and , if they were famous enough , music video . Like Old Testament god , they willed whole universe into being through their word .
 Now they have social medium . Case in point : On “ Stoopid , ” which came out last fall , 6ix9ine insult two rapper he wa feuding with at the time , but unless you were listening for it , you probably wouldn ’ t have noticed . Much more memorable were the Instagram video he made to antagonize the two ; in one he took his rival ’ s former girlfriend and mother of his child out shopping .
 This sort of online mythmaking is second nature to SoundCloud rapper , so called for the streaming service that birthed the scene . SoundCloud rap is not characterized by a particular sound so much a it anarchic energy — the face tattoo , the prescription drug , the orthographically complex handle . This scene ha been alarmingly fecund and seems to accelerate evolution in disturbing direction , a little like Lake Springfield on “ The Simpsons. ” Even within this ecosystem , 6ix9ine stood out like a chumbox thumbnail — is he ... real ?
 The problem , for 6ix9ine , wa that a big part of his adopted persona , both on Instagram and in his music , involved being a member of the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods . According to a Rolling Stone profile that came out after his arrest in November , this wa essentially an act : Danny Hernandez , in the year leading up to his fame , had been a trollish and goofy Bushwick deli employee ; his industry blacklisting had pushed him into the hand of an apparently gang-affiliated manager , who also provided him with a new edge . 6ix9ine is far from the only rapper to have ever made dubious claim to being a Blood , but Instagram ha a way of making even the most absurd feint real . Maybe the whole thing really wa a put-on , but also , he really did it . The Rolling Stone article recount how , at his arraignment , the presiding judge asked the prosecution how it knew Hernandez wa at real-life crime scene . “ The answer wa often simple : Hernandez had posted about it on Instagram . ”
 A liminal space ha always existed between rapper and their persona . Sometimes it ’ s a thin a a fig leaf , but even then it ’ s essential , both legally and morally . The gap between 6ix9ine and Danny Hernandez wa considerably wider , but he snapped it shut with his phone , merging fantasy with reality through a front-facing camera . Once intertwined on a criminal indictment , the two aren ’ t easily unwound . It wa reported in February that 6ix9ine , who pleaded guilty , agreed to help prosecutor in their case against his co-defendant , hoping for leniency : a reduced sentence and possibly witness protection . But helping 6ix9ine disappear into some corner of America might prove difficult , and not just because of the tattoo .

 Talking to the pop star about approaching life a if you ’ re seducing it .
 Interview by LAURA SNAPES
 In 1993 , the Swedish singer-songwriter Robyn turned 14 and finished middle school ; then she signed a record deal . She ha been making music ever since , starting with her 1995 debut album , “ Robyn Is Here , ” which netted her two Billboard Hot 100 single . Her 2005 album , “ Robyn , ” cemented her a a beloved , idiosyncratic pop star and earned her a Grammy nomination . She released a trilogy of mini-albums in 2010 , which included some of her biggest hit — “ Dancing on My Own ” and “ Call Your Girlfriend. ” Now , after a long gestation period , she ha returned with a new album and single , “ Honey . ”
 You ’ ve described the making of this song a searching for a feeling . A feeling of healing from sadness and wanting to share that with the world and with myself — a sense of self-love , excitement , some kind of peace of mind . Like when your strength is coming back . I wanted to describe this feeling like when you ’ re super close to someone else ’ s skin , or when you ’ re falling asleep , or when you ’ ve taken a drug that ’ s starting to kick in — sensation that are pleasurable , where your body is reacting to something outside of you .
 I felt naïve because I thought it wa about self-discovery , but a friend said , “ No , it ’ s about oral sex ! ” It could be about oral sex , sure ! Intimacy , definitely , but it could be with yourself . It doesn ’ t have to do with another person . In a way I think your analysis is probably the best one , because isn ’ t oral sex self-discovery ? Any experience you have that will give you a new point in your scale of emotion will make any other experience richer because you have a new point of reference .
 Maybe it ’ s about elevating self-care to the level of eroticism ? Not reserving that deep pleasure for a sexual sensation , but something you could experience day to day . Exactly ! That ’ s exactly it . It ’ s like approaching life a if you ’ re seducing it . As if you ’ re seducing yourself , or the other person , or your work , or whatever . Intimacy in every little thing .
 How do you approach life a if you ’ re seducing it ? I feel like I have to work for it every day . It ’ s like starting a little fire : You have to be so careful with it , not force it . You get it going and then you can use it and tend to it and start it back up again .
 Is your fire well tended ? Not at all . I ’ m not in a great place at the moment , to be honest . It ’ s a good conversation for me to have , a good reminder . I maybe need to go back and listen to some of my song myself to figure this out .
 [ How Robyn , pop ’ s glittery rebel , danced her way back from darkness . ]
 Your song are known for intermingling sadness and euphoria . But “ Honey ” is le triumphant than that . I don ’ t think life is that easy anymore . I used to believe it would all make sense if you just powered through . I really don ’ t feel that way anymore at all . I think it ’ s pragmatic — I really don ’ t feel pessimistic .
 The idea of “ self-care ” can seem like a challenge . Post-recession capitalism ha glorified the hustle so much . The society we live in at the moment — we didn ’ t really make it very good , you know ? It ’ s really tough to take care of yourself . Self-care is difficult when you have a 9-to-5 job , and people are on Instagram projecting these image of themselves — we ’ re in a time where everyone ’ s engaged in storytelling in such an aggressive way . Stories are amazing — they ’ re part of what it is to be human — but you have to be aware they ’ re story . That ’ s the problem with capitalism : It ’ s always trying to trick you into thinking there ’ s a purpose for all of this . But you can actually use a story that relates to something more real than buying yourself out of anxiety .
 It ’ s jarring to see people turning themselves into personal brand a part of that storytelling . That ’ s the strange thing about being an artist . There ’ s always a gap between how I see myself and how other people see me . When I wa younger , I felt like it wa easier for me to absorb other people ’ s thought about me , and more complex to understand what wa me and what wa other people , and how to respond to those expectation . I ’ m still learning that . I ’ ve been more specific with my expression on this album than I ’ ve been able to be before , but I ’ m aware that that doesn ’ t mean that people understand me . I don ’ t even know if that ’ s the point .
 A lot of today ’ s pop is about nihilism , depression , anxiety . There ’ s real sadness behind your album , too . It struck me a something that ’ s easy for the industry to exploit . Definitely : Pop at the moment is depressing . Hip-hop is really dark . The music kid are listening to is heavy ! Maybe it ’ s hard to be positive and optimistic at the moment , for a lot of young people — the number of voice that are trying to share this space in their brain is crazy . But maybe it ’ s cool that they get to explore their darkness a a collective earlier in life , because maybe it will also get them to the point where they ’ re letting go of it early a well .
 Is the industry set up for artist to be able to share their pain but protect themselves ? It ’ s really difficult for anyone to not be exploited in our society a a whole . As an artist , you ’ re exposed , because you deal in emotion all the time . People want you to be vulnerable . If you think about sport — you look at it because someone ’ s pushing themselves to their limit . If you don ’ t risk anything , why would people want to see it happen ?
 You turn 40 this June . You could listen to “ Honey ” a a celebration of the richness that come with age , and maybe aging a a woman . I think it can be that , for sure . I ’ m not looking forward to being 40 , to getting older . I know that ’ s not a very mature thing to say , but it is what it is .

 Who knew that flamenco — and a medieval love-gone-wrong tale — could be so relevant ?
 By MARTA BAUSELLS
 It wa hard to tell how many people in the club liked flamenco , an art form not much associated with young people anymore . But on New Year ’ s Eve in Barcelona , when the palmas hand clap that open Rosalía ’ s “ Malamente ” started pulsing from the speaker , look of recognition flashed from face to face . And by the time Rosalía — an artist from the nearby town of Sant Esteve Sesrovires — started rapping , everyone wa clapping along . Some of the younger girl even twerked .
 It ’ s not unheard-of for flamenco to make incursion into mainstream Spanish pop culture , but Rosalía is different . She sound and feel cosmopolitan , cool in a sophisticated and almost foreign way . She doesn ’ t sound a if she ’ s playing just for u . And indeed , she isn ’ t : This two-and-a-half-minute song , with it balmy synth bass and irresistible syncopation and enticing whisper peppered throughout , ha racked up more than 59 million view on YouTube . Her success , she ha argued , is partly because of listener ’ weariness with the homogenization — which is to say , the Anglicization — of pop . Her own aesthetic is polished , globally recognizable , informed by hip-hop and trap music . But it ’ s also saturated with bullfighting and windmill and fire . Her sophomore album , “ El Mal Querer ” ( which roughly translates a “ loving badly ” ) , is a conceptual project patterned on the subversive medieval text “ Flamenca. ” The last frame of the “ Malamente ” video feature a figure wearing the conical capirote hat worn by penitent during Holy Week — while also riding a skateboard .
 “ Malamente ” ’ s appearance in the club also seemed to inspire a few eye roll . Maybe this is the price of success in a culture that look askance at overt display of ambition or self-actualization , especially by woman . By New Year ’ s Eve , Rosalía had come up in every conversation I ’ d had for day — she wa a interesting to my grandmother a she wa to my 12-year-old cousin . The local fascination tended to focus le on her art and more on her a a phenomenon , on the extraordinary speed of her rise to stardom . It would spark argument too , about cultural appropriation and the Romany community , who have always been closely associated with flamenco .
 “ Malamente ” mean “ badly , ” and the story of “ Flamenca ” is not a happy one . A woman get married to a man who later grows jealous and imprisons her . It ’ s not surprising , these day , that a global star would be singing about such suffering . But Rosalía reminds u that pain and possession are topic that have interested human for century . Millions of her listener must be enjoying this music without understanding the language , but right now , for me , it feel cathartic — soothing , even — to be able to stand in a crowd singing “ badly , badly , so badly ” while clapping my hand .

 Interview by HAZEL CILLS
 Last fall , Marie Davidson , a French Canadian producer of electronic music , released “ Work It , ” an aggressively rattling track on which she serf “ kind of like an M.C./personal trainer , ” exhorting listener not to dance but to work , constantly and sweatily , seven day a week . The song became a minor anthem , and the album it came from , “ Working Class Woman , ” wa embraced a one of the best dance record of the year .
 What sort of place were you at in your life when you wrote this song ? Obviously I wa working a lot . I had already toured Europe and the U.S. , and I wa going back to Europe to play festival . I wanted to make a banger to play live — I just picked up my microphone and started talking . The song came out in a funny way , but the undertone is serious .
 I don ’ t think all people should work all the time . It ’ s sarcastic , it ’ s humorous , but in the joke there ’ s also truth . It ’ s why I say , toward the end , that when I say “ work , ” you have to work for yourself , love yourself , feed yourself . Whatever you do , whatever amount of energy you put into something , you have to do it for yourself and not to please others . Not to build this facade or this persona or achievement .
 Do you think people base too much of their self-worth on their work ? Absolutely . We live in a society that is based on work — goal , achievement , money . Of course ! It ’ s a real problem — workaholism , exhaustion , burnout . We ’ re not taught in this society — it ’ s not valued — to take time and just learn to love yourself . You ’ re taught to be strong , to look smart , to be useful . But I think you become a much more useful person if you learn how to love yourself .
 Do you think people who aren ’ t musician are aware of how physically taxing it can be ? It would be hard to know . When you look at picture or video , it doesn ’ t look like that . It look really fun and glamorous . And it is , sometimes , for a few hour . But it ’ s not a glamorous job being a touring musician . I still have people come up to me after a gig or somewhere , saying : “ You ’ re so lucky . I wish I had your life. ” And I ’ m like : What do you mean by that ? Do you think I woke up one morning and became who I am ? It ’ s year and year of work and trial and error . It ’ s a real job , like being a carpenter or being a designer .
 People think of the dance floor a this freeing space . But you ’ re kind of pointing out that this is just another workplace . For me , at least , it is . It used to be different . When I wa 16 and I started going out in Montreal , going to underground party and raf and club , it wa magical . But it wa different : I wasn ’ t working . It wasn ’ t my job . I wa going there for fun . Even if I wa playing , it wa special . It wasn ’ t in the schedule , where you just do it over and over again . That space is now a work space for me . There ’ s no more leisure . I ’ ve sacrificed that freedom for other thing . Now if I want to feel something mind-blowing or magical , I have to look for it outside of club culture . The music never loses it magic , but the social thing happening at a party or something like that ? No .
 It sound a though the song stemmed from your personal experience , but it feel universal . When I made it , I knew anyone could relate . Because this is the time we live in . Everything go really fast now . People are expected to produce and achieve . It ’ s kind of sad , I think . There ’ s a rigidity in that mind-set about what you should be doing with your life . We ’ re ruled by capitalism , so that ’ s what we get . We are living comfortably , and people feel that they are free , but I don ’ t think that individual are that free in society .
 So how do you make art under capitalism ? I don ’ t care . When I ’ m in my studio composing music , I really don ’ t think about that — about what is the potential of that song , where is it going to take me , what doe it mean to the world . I don ’ t care . I never did . I don ’ t think about my label or my manager or anybody . My insecurity come after , when it ’ s time to be in the world .

 The british singer-songwriter who turned homage into a signature style .
 By JONAH WEINER
 James Blake wa talking about shanzhai , a Chinese phrase that mean , roughly , “ knockoff , ” and that stem from the time-honored tradition in Chinese art of apprentice ’ mimicking their master — “ copying something until you can better it , ” he said , “ or if not better it , compete with it . ”
 Blake , a Grammy-winning avant-gardist with an ear for pop , who ha been playing the piano since he wa about 6 , ha a long list of hero whom he ha studiously copied in pursuit of his own sound . Copying the virtuoso jazz-pianist Art Tatum , the protominimalist French composer Erik Satie and the midcentury gospel maestro the Rev . James Cleveland taught Blake novel way of opening up complex chord structure and fitting them — to gorgeous , aching effect — around deceptively simple melody . Copying singer-songwriters like Joni Mitchell and Stevie Wonder emboldened him to write and sing pop song with increasing emotional candor . Copying the hip-hop producer Timbaland and the South London dubstep craftsman Mala informed Blake ’ s love of distorted timbre — electronic rhythm that skitter and twitch a often a they groove — and of sampling , a technique of literal copying ( and cutting and pasting ) so central to Blake ’ s practice today that , even when he isn ’ t sampling anyone else , he routinely sample himself . “ I ’ ll sit at a piano , improvising ” into a microphone , he explained , then search the tape for building block that he can pluck out and , with editing software , arrange into new composition .
 Blake stand at an imposing 6-foot-6 and carry himself with the deliberateness of a man at risk of scraping his head on doorway . Early in February , in a wood-paneled rehearsal space in the Larchmont neighborhood of Los Angeles , he sat at a Prophet ’ 08 synthesizer opposite Rob McAndrews , a multi-instrumentalist , and Ben Assiter , a drummer , his longtime friend and touring bandmates . At their foot , black cable snaked and cloverleafed among cluster of red- , blue- , silver- and cream-colored effect pedal , like track connecting village in a model-train set .
 Blake is from London , but three and a half year ago he began dating the British comedic actress Jameela Jamil , and when she booked a lead role on the NBC sitcom “ The Good Place , ” he tagged along with her to California . Now Blake led McAndrews and Assiter through a practice run of “ I ’ ll Come Too , ” a swooning new song about joining Jamil out west — about that moment when you want to follow a crush anywhere . The song come from his fourth LP , “ Assume Form , ” which wa released in January . “ That ’ s a fun one to play , ” he said when they finished . “ I really like it . But it ’ s hard — I ’ m singing all the way through , in all these different range , and I don ’ t get a chance to breathe . When I recorded it , I broke the vocal up . ”
 The extent to which Blake ha digested the lesson of his musical hero is illustrated not only by his decade-spanning run of single , EPs and album but also by the number of pop auteur who have collaborated with him . Frank Ocean , Beyoncé , Kendrick Lamar , Jay-Z , André 3000 and Travis Scott are among those artist who have enlisted Blake ’ s assistance . As an influence and a collaborator , Blake ha helped shape two of the more striking trend in contemporary pop : beat that mutate over the course of a song , resisting any traditionally identifiable center , and an emotional atmosphere in which the line between hedonism and melancholy , bliss and despair come undone .
 His influence extends even to artist he hasn ’ t worked with directly . In 2011 , I visited Drake — a pop giant whose entire musical project ha been about smudging the line between hedonism and melancholy — at a converted Toronto warehouse , where he wa working on his second album with his musical right hand , the producer known a 40 . The room wa free of decoration save for 40 ’ s copy of Blake ’ s debut LP , perched on a windowsill like a talisman . Drake later sampled unreleased music of Blake ’ s on a single called “ 0 to 100/The Catch Up. ” Blake , who hadn ’ t approved this usage , got his part removed . At the start of his career , Blake told me , he ’ d been a solitary , “ solipsistic ” bedroom producer . “ I wa so protective of my idea — so militantly and obsessively protective , ” he explained , that it wasn ’ t until year later , when “ I found personal openness , for maybe the first time in my life , that I found collaborative openness , too . ”
 “ Assume Form ” is an album expressly about getting out of one ’ s skull . Five-odd year ago , Blake suffered from a depression so severe that he considered suicide . “ Assume Form ” chronicle his escape from that depression , and it title track , which lead the album , play like a statement of purpose . Blake described it to me a “ a song about intimacy — about feeling like you don ’ t deserve intimacy and feeling like there ’ s no way somebody could really want it with you. ” The song ’ s theme are sex , shame and — by the end — happiness . “ It ’ s by far the most vulnerable , exposed song on the entire record , ” Blake said . “ It ’ s saying , If you ’ re comfortable with this , then the bar ha been set . ”
 Blake wa two and a half week into rehearsal for a tour that would take him around the country and then around the world . He and his band manned a variety of instrument , mostly electronic : the Prophet ’ 08 ; a large , modular synthesizer , studded with knob , plug and blinking light , which McAndrews operated ; and a rubber-covered pad , nestled between cymbal and high-hats , that Assiter thwacked with drumstick to trigger pulse and prerecorded percussive sound . Translating and arranging Blake ’ s intricate studio creation for live concert is a tricky task made trickier still by his refusal to use a laptop . “ With live electronic music , I ’ ve seen the man-checking-emails situation so many time , ” Blake said , referring to that category of lackluster performance in which artist stand unbudgingly at MacBooks , pecking at key . “ I want an audience member to see what ’ s happening . So if Ben is playing the kick and Rob is over here fiddling with knob and it ’ s clear that what he ’ s doing is changing the sound , then it make sense . ”
 The trio consulted a whiteboard upon which the new album ’ s dozen song were listed . “ Should we try ‘ Assume Form ? ’ ” Assiter asked . Blake furrowed his brow . The new album ’ s title track is , structurally speaking , strange . As it lyric switch between optimistic vow of commitment and confession of insecurity , this duality is echoed in the music , which consists of two alternating piano motif — one shimmering , the other overcast . The track began a a long , meandering improvisation from which Blake eventually sampled two disparate chunk , putting them into jarring conversation . When I asked Blake to explain the harmonic unease between these two part , he replied : “ The song essentially modulates from D major in the first section to B flat in the second , which are unrelated key . The first section ha the tonic a the bass note , which give it this firmly rooted presence , whereas the other section ha the third in the bass , which make it feel suspended — which is when the lyric turn to self-doubt. ” He thought for a moment . “ It ’ s quite an odd pairing . It doesn ’ t work , musically . But there ’ s a harmony there . Joni Mitchell doe something similar on ‘ My Old Man , ’ where it go into a minor key when she sings , ‘ But when he ’ s gone . ... ’ ” Complicating thing further , Blake ’ s piano playing on the track wa “ loose — like , microsecond ” offbeat , he said , which would add yet another layer of difficulty when it came to replicating “ Assume Form ” live . “ Let ’ s try something else , ” he told Assiter .
 Blake wa raised by his father , James Litherland , a singer-songwriter and guitarist with a prog-rock pedigree , and his mother , a graphic designer and cycling instructor , in Enfield , a North London suburb . He described his life from adolescence on a largely unhappy , warm and supportive parent notwithstanding . “ I had anger , ” he said . “ A lot of it. ” As a teenager , “ I had terrible acne , and now I think it wa a physical presentation of how angry I was. ” What angered him ? “ My treatment by other people , ” he said . “ People I ’ d been open with . Romantic and personal betrayal . And just a feeling of persecution . I didn ’ t fit in , and I resented not fitting in . I had a couple friend outside of school , so I wasn ’ t totally alone , but I remember year of sitting by myself at lunch . Or just going home because I didn ’ t want to suffer in public. ” Rather than getting out this anger , he repressed it . “ As a child I wa very open and emotionally vulnerable and said how I felt , ” he recalled . “ And I sort of had that beaten out of me — not physically but emotionally . At school , and in British society , there wa this sense of , if you don ’ t behave in the right way — if you ’ re not coolheaded — then people punish you for that . So that wa my childhood , that reflex being stamped out of me . And it stayed with me well into my 20 . ”
 Instead , Blake said , music “ started to be my first language ” and “ talking about how I felt wa second or third. ” In 2007 he enrolled in the Popular Music program at Goldsmiths University of London . As important a his class were the nighttime excursion he took to club like Plastic People and Mass . There , Blake discovered a community of producer and D.J.s — black , white , “ from all part of London , ” he said — who were busy hashing out the oblong dimension of dubstep , a new kind of dance music defined by cavernous reverb , sinister drone and deceptively complex rhythm in which growlingly deep bass line were the primary propellant . Whereas an amped-up version of dubstep soon grew into a global phenomenon , throbbing in GoPro commercial and glitzy Las Vegas club , it wa more subtle in it dynamic at first . Its architect assumed gnomic pseudonym like Coki , Skream and Loefah and tended to direct attention away from themselves and toward the dance floor . “ You can imagine how that appealed to me at the time , ” Blake said .
 On small but influential label , he began releasing his own dubstep-inspired song marked by his sophisticated harmonic sense . Initially he sampled other people ’ s vocal , but later he began singing himself . Blake eventually became comfortable enough to let his voice — a lovely , quaking baritone — ring out clearly , but at first he distorted it self-protectively : “ I intentionally disembodied my voice , ” he said , explaining that “ there ’ s a safety in alteration , because it no longer ha to represent the natural resonance that came out of your chest . ”
 In 2011 , his debut album , “ James Blake , ” wa shortlisted alongside release by Adele and P.J . Harvey for Britain ’ s prestigious Mercury Prize . The album ’ s fan included Bjork , who attended Blake ’ s concert ; Thom Yorke , who dropped Blake ’ s song into D.J . mix ; and Brian Eno and RZA , who collaborated with Blake on “ Overgrown ” ( 2013 ) , which wa also shortlisted for a Mercury ( this time he won ) . Success didn ’ t cure Blake ’ s long-seething unhappiness , however . Around this time , he told me : “ I wa at home , playing PS4 and smoking weed , which I ’ d been doing a lot , and I started to have these hallucination of black . The screen stopped being the game and started being the void . I had physical tremor and panic attack and had to go to my room and just lie there . I started saying thing like , What ’ s the point ? What ’ s the point of me ? ”
 He wa having trouble writing new music , which inspired an existential dread in him . He remembered thinking , That ’ s my only expression a a human being , so I may a well not be here . He never took concrete step to kill himself , he said , “ but I wa thinking about it a lot . Thinking about nothingness . I wa just despondent . It didn ’ t matter to me whether I wa here or not . So I wa at that point . And I wa caught just in time . ”
 It wa Jamil who caught him — she , more than anyone else in his life , Blake said , helped him to break free of his self-destructive tendency , prodding him to speak up when he grew sullen and requiring complete emotional transparency . “ Nothing else will do , ” he said . “ In a relationship , something rot unless there ’ s full disclosure. ” He also saw a therapist specializing in a technique known a eye-movement desensitization reprocessing , or E.M.D.R. , in which a patient recall unhappy memory while moving the eye back and forth rapidly and tapping the hand in time — reconfiguring a relationship to past trauma , in effect , by setting them to a beat .
 Blake ’ s default mode on “ Assume Form , ” which he call “ essentially a pop album , ” is one you might call cautious euphoria . It is also the most collaborative thing he ha put out , featuring guest production from the Atlanta-based hip-hop luminary Metro Boomin and a series of duet with star like Travis Scott , André 3000 and the breakout Catalan singer Rosalía . It would be important , Blake said , when playing these song live , to carve out room for improvisatory run . “ After seven show , you almost feel like you ’ re on rail , and I hate that , ” he said . “ Feeling like I don ’ t have a choice . With tour you ’ re already so tightly scheduled in all other regard , that ’ s when I start to get anxious , feeling like I ’ m locked in . ”
 The band moved next to a song called “ Where ’ s the Catch , ” on which Blake and André 3000 sing and rap , respectively , about what Blake characterized a “ a distrust of really great thing : ‘ Everything ’ s seemingly nice — for today . But what ’ s around the corner ? ’ ” Rather than play André ’ s verse all the way through at concert , the band intended to chop up his vocal and distribute them across the track in stuttering burst . As they rehearsed the song , Blake ’ s vocal , too , were chopped up and fed through McAndrews ’ s synthesizer , where he warped them even further . The trio rode out the song with a jam session , adding layer after layer of noise on their way to a squalling crescendo . Blake ’ s vocal grew increasingly refracted and spectral , and there wa something both frightening and exhilarating about the sound of the electronics swallowing him up whole .

 A shameless polymath pop act delivers the cascading-contemporary-references track we didn ’ t know we needed .
 By STEVEN HYDEN
 ‘ Love It if We Made It ” is a Jedi mind trick . This is the track with contemporary relevance that you ’ re looking for . You will consider it a statement that mimic the nonstop rattle of social medium and the slow drip of Trump-era anxiety . The song , though , is decidedly le subtle than the wave of Obi-Wan Kenobi ’ s hand : Matty Healy , the gregarious lead singer of the English pop-rock band the 1975 , delivers his litany of contemporary pop-culture reference in an impassioned emo-dude howl , over an unchanging and relentless synth-pop stomp that sound like New Order paying homage to the Fall . Donald Trump , Kanye West , Eric Garner , Lil Peep , the failure of modernity , the ubiquity of fake news , Healy ’ s own heroin addiction — it ’ s all accounted for with the maniacal thoroughness of Billy Joel straining to rhyme “ Zhou Enlai ” with “ Bridge on the River Kwai . ”
 But “ Love It if We Made It ” no longer make me think about the Sturm und Drang of right now , or about millennials , or about being extremely online . It make me think of one of the most popular rock band of the ’ 70 and ’ 80 .
 I blame “ Bohemian Rhapsody. ” It ’ s tempting to view the runaway box-office success of the Freddie Mercury biopic — with a worldwide gross of $ 860 million and counting , it ’ s the most popular film about a real-life musician ever made — a an indication that the public yearns for the return of band that will ( stomp ) will ( stomp ) rock you ( clap ) . But overt revival act — like the popular Michigan act Greta Van Fleet , whose member all dress exactly a Brian May did in 1973 — tend not to sonically resemble Queen beyond it first single , the quicksilver Led Zeppelin nod “ Keep Yourself Alive. ” No , the contemporary band that come closest to emulating Queen ’ s whole legacy — a a shameless polymath pop act , willing to try anything , including but not remotely limited to metal , disco , rockabilly , theatrical English music-hall , folk , synth-pop and power ballad that turn unexpectedly into mock-opera freakouts — is the 1975 . ( Perhaps Greta Van Fleet should have called themselves the 1973 . )
 Here ’ s a scene that ’ s not in “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” : In 1978 , while making Queen ’ s seventh album , “ Jazz , ” Freddie Mercury wa inspired to write his own litany-of-pop-culture-references song . He decided that “ Jaws ” wasn ’ t his scene , and he didn ’ t like “ Star Wars. ” He wa also skeptical of God , Peter Pan , Frankenstein and Superman , but staunchly pro-drugs . There wa no such thing a logging off back then , so his symbol of freedom and release wa an old-fashioned one : bicycling . “ I want to ride it where I like , ” Mercury sang , a always committed to nothing else above his own liberation . “ Bicycle Race , ” a worldwide hit , is a perfect example of how Queen routinely violated one of the central truism of rock , later articulated by David St. Hubbins in the 1984 film “ This Is Spinal Tap ” — “ It ’ s such a fine line between stupid and clever. ” The implication is that striving for transcendence is admirable , but it can easily embarrass you .
 [ Can a quote-unquote band drag rock into the future ? The 1975 is trying it hardest . ]
 For Mercury and his bandmates , there wa no line between stupid and clever ; in many of the best Queen song , stupid is clever . It take a special kind of fearlessness to write song about killer queen who are dynamite with laser beam , or fat-bottomed girl who make the rocking world go ’ round , or really fast car that you might want to have sex with . Part of the thrill of listening to Queen is hearing them get away with this sublime silliness , again and again .
 The 1975 have a similar inclination , in the word of Spin magazine , “ to look and sound ridiculous. ” When the band made it debut on “ Saturday Night Live ” in 2016 , Healy pulled out every conceivable louche rock-singer move — he wore leather pant with no shirt , he tousled his curly black Sideshow Bob mane , he stuck out his tongue , he thrust his crotch like Tom Jones serenading an audience of divorcées . And yet there ’ s an ongoing debate a to whether the 1975 should even be considered a “ real ” rock band at all . Its third album , “ A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships , ” is it most willfully diffuse yet , touching on bedroom R. & B. , jazzy torch song , SoundCloud rap , ambient music and lot of other genre that a “ smarter , ” more conservative band would never dream of dabbling in . Last year , when pressed by Pitchfork to explain “ Love It if We Made It , ” Healy posed a delectable stupid-clever rhetorical : “ How weird is reality ? ”
 The 1975 polarizes indie-rock fan — a bloc never comfortable with ostentatious display of self-valorization — but detractor and admirer alike agree on this band ’ s utter absurdity . There may be no other way for a proper rock band to act . At a time when our life are on display like never before , putting u all on the razor ’ s edge of life-changing public shame , how exhilarating is it to see people insist on riding where they like ?

 Growing up mean seeing hero age , rudely , at the same pace a you .
 By LYDIA KIESLING
 In one episode of “ The Office , ” Michael Scott ( played by Steve Carell ) put together a video called “ Lazy Scranton ” to welcome new employee to his branch . In keeping with his character ’ s genius for mangling pop-culture reference , the video is Michael ’ s misguided stab at parodying the viral “ S.N.L. ” digital short “ Lazy Sunday , ” wherein Andy Samberg and Chris Parnell rap about getting cupcake and going to see “ The Chronicles of Narnia. ” Michael ’ s version , which includes line like “ Call poison control if you ’ re bit by a spider/But check that it ’ s covered by your health care provider ! ” leaf the new employee stone-faced . When one of them quits , Michael pleads with him . “ Didn ’ t you think ‘ Lazy Scranton ’ wa funny ? ” “ No , ” the employee say . “ Was it supposed to be funny ? ”
 I thought about this moment when I heard “ Can ’ t Knock the Hustle , ” a song Weezer released late last year . The track , a reimagining of Jay-Z ’ s song by the same title , is the marquee single from the band ’ s “ Black Album. ” I first heard Weezer ’ s version while driving a car , and I almost had to pull over . “ What is happening ? ” I asked .
 The Jay-Z original is about selling drug , with line like “ At my arraignment screaming/All u black got is sport and entertainment , until we even/Thieving , a long a I ’ m breathing , ” with a chorus sung by Mary J. Blige . The Weezer interpretation is about the gig economy and unspools in painfully dorky line like “ I ’ m an ugly [ expletive ] but I work hella harder/And you can write a blog about it ” and “ Leave a five-star review and I ’ ll leave you one too. ” The song is unnervingly , relentlessly bouncy . In the video , Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy play a beleaguered ride-share driver . “ What is happening ? ” his face seems to say .
 Earlier this year , the band released an album of actual cover ( “ No Scrubs , ” “ Paranoid ” and “ Africa , ” among others ) , none of which had the overwhelmingly depressing effect of “ Can ’ t Knock the Hustle. ” What is happening with this song ? There ’ s the peculiar comic engagement with the desperate race to the bottom for American employer . There ’ s the white appropriation of black art , a refraction of hip-hop trope that is about one thousand time le successful than “ Lazy Sunday ” ( possibly even “ Lazy Scranton ” ) . And there ’ s the growing-old phenomenon of seeing former hero make choice you don ’ t understand , in a way that make you grapple with all your own previous choice .
 I have to acknowledge that I may be taking “ Can ’ t Knock the Hustle ” personally to an unreasonable degree . Weezer is a band with a fanatical but divided fan base , much of which belief that the band went downhill after it second album , “ Pinkerton ” ( there ’ s even an “ S.N.L. ” skit about this schism ) . I ’ m a Weezer fan who considers her soul to have been irrevocably altered by “ The Blue Album , ” the band ’ s first , which wa big guitar , big harmonization , big falsetto , big emotion . It can still conjure sense memory of decade past — window down , crooning out into the forgiving dusk . Then there wa “ Pinkerton , ” which had , in addition to it big guitar and emotion , big weirdness about gender and race . I look back on my 18-year-old self belting out line like “ You are 18-year-old girl who live in small city of Japan , ” and have , if not regret , question . “ Pinkerton ” now seems like a raw , risky , sometimes repellent work of art , but one that earned it place in the age-old conversation about what is permitted by the artist .
 “ Can ’ t Knock the Hustle , ” on the other hand , sound like an insincere effort to start a conversation that nobody want to have , or at least that nobody want to have with Weezer . The band ’ s recent spate of cover , even the one that rise to the level of “ fun curiosity , ” feel like another race to the bottom in a cultural economy where attention matter more than anything else . ( “ Was it supposed to be funny ? ” I hear the new employee ask . )
 It ’ s not Weezer ’ s fault that I can ’ t let go of the past , but getting older is hard enough without Weezer making you feel it so acutely . “ Can ’ t Knock the Hustle ” fill me with a vague , general regret and an apprehension for what ’ s to come . As the song itself portends : “ The future ’ s so bright I got ta poke my eye out . ”

 What do you do when you can ’ t put off the future any more ?
 By RYAN BRADLEY
 A few year ago , Sharon Van Etten wa interviewing another musician — Mimi Parker , from the band Low — on the NPR program “ All Songs Considered. ” Van Etten , then in her mid-30s , wa thinking about having a kid and wanted to ask Parker , a mother of two , about what it would be like to be a mom and a touring musician at the same time .
 “ My music is the center of my world , ” Van Etten said while setting up a very big question : How doe someone — anyone , but especially an artist — make room in her life for her work , when her work might no longer be the center of her world ?
 “ You just figure it out , ” Parker answered .
 In the year that followed , Van Etten fell in love , pulled back from touring , enrolled in school to study psychology , wa cast for an acting part in the Netflix show “ The OA , ” wrote a movie score , gave birth ( a boy , now 2 ) — and in January released a new album , her first since 2014 .
 The album ’ s title — “ Remind Me Tomorrow ” — come from an Apple computer software-update alert option that Van Etten found herself selecting again and again , a perpetual prompt for something she needed to do and never quite got done . It ’ s a tidy summation of motherhood and artistry and the process of figuring them out , often at the same time , because , well , a lot of the figuring out seems to be figuring out what can wait until tomorrow .
 [ Read about the many life of Sharon Van Etten . ]
 The album ’ s cover is another reflection of ( or on ) this conflict : a photo of a room with two toddler in it , their stuff — toy , clothing , everything — spilled out around them . The image come from the filmmaker Katherine Dieckmann . ( It wa Dieckmann ’ s film “ Strange Weather ” that Van Etten scored . ) Those are Dieckmann ’ s kid amid the chaos . Van Etten recalled in a Vanity Fair interview that when she told Dieckmann she wa pregnant and worried about how she wa going to make motherhood work , Dieckmann pulled out her phone and pulled up the photo . “ You ’ ll figure it out , ” she said .
 “ Remind Me Tomorrow ” is about all the stuff that can ’ t be KonMari ’ d out of existence : life , love , the figuring , the delaying , and the fact that eventually , one day , but probably not today , the time will come to finally do the all those thing the “ remind me tomorrow ” prompt had so imperfectly kept at bay .
 The standout track , the song you want to raise up your fist and loosen your hip to , is “ Comeback Kid. ” It ’ s driving , then sweet , and it ’ s very stripped down . Every minor variation of the refrain seems to offer a new perspective . Sometimes when she sings it , Van Etten seems to be talking to an earlier version of herself , “ Come back , kid ! ” Other time , she ’ s talking about someone who is definitely not her : the comeback kid . In the video , Van Etten stand singing a old photo are projected onto her face and body and the wall behind her . The photo are from Van Etten ’ s past , but there ’ s very little that ’ s specific about them . They just look like the past in general . Which is probably the point : The past can be both particular and general , a her decision to use cover art featuring someone else ’ s kid might indicate .
 “ Comeback Kid ” is a song about glancing at our past self while dealing with the whole jumble of conflicting emotion that looking too closely at our past might dredge up . But mostly , it ’ s about the looking itself . It ’ s the looking that ’ s important . The world shift ; you look at the past ; you look at the future . And then what do you do ? You figure it out .

 A saxophone , a tuba and two drum kit combine to create a piece of music that somehow capture the whole history of jazz .
 By MARK RICHARDSON
 Listen closely to the third track from the 2018 studio album “ Your Queen Is a Reptile , ” by the London jazz outfit Sons of Kemet , and you will hear a tenor saxophone , a tuba and two drummer , all moving at great speed . The whole operation sound like four people piled into a wagon tumbling down a hill , just barely in control . Each element contributes equally . Because the bass come from an instrument powered by breath , the darting low end is le of a woofer-pumping presence and more of a song-within-a-song , a melody that you can hum on it own . The saxophone shout back , offering growling rhythmic line with just a pinch of melody . And the dueling drummer build one intensely syncopated beat from part of several — the foundational Caribbean rhythm of the Cuban tresillo , martial snare roll , pinging metallic percussion reminiscent of the roaring Afrobeat of Fela Kuti . Listen without knowing another thing about it , and this is a viscerally overwhelming piece of music .
 Widen the focus , though , and you will learn that the song is called “ My Queen Is Harriet Tubman , ” and that each song title on the album reference a heroic black woman who ha inspired the band ’ s leader , the London-born , Barbados-raised saxophone player Shabaka Hutchings . Maybe that knowledge give the burning intensity of the song — it feeling of joy streaked with struggle — a new dimension . Pull back further and take in Hutchings ’ s place a a central figure of one of this era ’ s most remarkable music scene , sometimes called New London Jazz — an approach that incorporates sound and style from all over the African diaspora , along with locally sourced ingredient from the British electronic underground . Let even more into the frame — say , that Hutchings ha performed with the Sun Ra Arkestra and is now signed to Impulse ! , the imprint that issued major work from artist including John Coltrane , Alice Coltrane and Pharoah Sanders — and then listen again to situate this music within the entire sweep of recorded jazz over the last 100 year .
 All this history is carried inside the song and transmitted by these master musician thorough their instrument . It ’ s a sax , a tuba and two drum kit . It ’ s a tune and an unforgettable beat . It ’ s a call to action and a command to find the dance floor . It ’ s a deeply political piece of music that say a great deal without uttering a word . It ’ s music of this exact moment , built from sound that have bounced back and forth across the Atlantic over century . Sounds that landed here , in a song honoring a woman whose face will , perhaps , on some future Sons of Kemet tour across the United States , be found on a $ 20 bill in Hutchings ’ s pocket , a queen ’ s visage replacing that of the dead president so admired by the current one .
